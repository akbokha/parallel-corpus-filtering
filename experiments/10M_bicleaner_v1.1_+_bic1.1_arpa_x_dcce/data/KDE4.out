the package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
more information about using &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings Add @-@ Set .... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard configuration modules from the package KDE ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are available on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to the extras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of apost@@ asy , if available , delete .
the module module filter ( also known as folder filter ) in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under extras . using the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to use , you can view the DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the right document . as a default , the display starts with the root index of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this worm node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type identi@@ fier / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the distinctive feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in revealing the folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is displayed by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the dimensions of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder or folder is , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; instruction command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; there is an entry in the tre@@ ad representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation you have the right angles meaningful color and v@@ ents .
the color of a rectangle that is switched on View mode , can be either depth for the slight detection of the sh@@ ach@@ ts or the illustration of a different file level such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle may be lab@@ eled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether enough space is to be displayed , or whether the surface of subordin@@ ate angles is to occur ( whereby the surface errors can occur by restrictions when signs of the tre@@ ad ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of let@@ tering in the rectangle .
with display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . if the Tre@@ ats in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be respected . it will be drawn to represent the tigh@@ tening of the entries and that frames need space , which is then lost the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square .
as spl@@ itting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries will be left to the implementation . in this case , it is for the certi@@ fying and for avoiding plac@@ ements through frames always beneficial the areas that are as the square . the best methods for this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive igni@@ tion .
you can specify the minimal surface for an entry over the menu view . instead , a spac@@ er pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an independent entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
if you call the module image gallery , opens a dialog with which you can set the appearance of the gallery .
the option title of this page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a turning field to adjust the number of mini@@ ons each line in the gallery .
with the An@@ kreu@@ z@@ feld fil@@ ename of the picture indicate whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
indicate the file size of the picture you indicate whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
indicate whether the size of the images can be displayed under thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialogue folder you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub@@ folders will be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
the sub@@ folder sub@@ folder can be set with a sli@@ der or a rotary panel , up to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy original images to the original images to copy whether the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
using the An@@ go@@ z@@ feld comment file you can use a comment file for cap@@ turing the images in the gallery .
in the cross @-@ box own color depth you can specify a different color depth than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings allows you easy access to general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under extras HTML settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area is available in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under window navigation panel , or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to media playback .
browsing recognition includes a menu entry in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; added to which you can change the browser and operating system detection for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access to only certain browsers .
the Standard Brow@@ ser@@ Det@@ des &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( ) ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ ec@@ ko ) . if you are using a web page , you can use browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the identification in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse access to browsers based on Mozilla . you need for example the M@@ SI@@ E Brow@@ ser@@ _ identi@@ fier , to call with the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages which do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use its own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes , are correctly represented with the identification of this outdated browser .
this option is used to browse browser _ identi@@ fier for all pages of the website you are visiting .
using the menu entry ... you can adjust the scope of the information about the browser and the operating system in detail .
with this &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; module review your &amp; CSS ; -@@ styl@@ ish@@ ness and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .

an easy to use camera code is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and select your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tised . of course each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ tization ; together .
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to review and correct your photos , commented on and correct . the editing abilities can be easily extended with KDE image plugins interface ( manual ) modules easily .
although &amp; B came ; easy to use , it makes no@@ zzle professional skills available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw conver@@ tation by means of li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC @-@ color@@ ations workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , e.g. on the camera or the lens over which you can search for .
like all of the &amp; KDE programmes , programmes are also very digi@@ tised ; an open source project . that means , it is reli@@ ant on supporting the end users . therefore , they should report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to make the mel@@ ting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use in the program , the Help menu opens a page in the error report . if you use this link@@ ages , your web browser opens a page in the error report . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; is a project which is supported by a community . that means that users and developers came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one , then we would like to answer questions about other users of &amp; scan ; and hopefully soon we will answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , you should know this language therefore powerful .
you can also visit the text ; homepage to visit News about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tised .
the best start to get involved in &amp; digi@@ tised , is the registration in the developer mailing list . guidance for the login in the developer mailing list of &amp; And came ; .
if you start &amp; review ; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database . you can simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file will be stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as much folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ tised , will also use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk you can specify the top folder , the images containing as the base folder . no picture will be changed as an album . no picture will be changed when browsing the folder you will see a progress show like this :
&amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; dur@@ ated recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian path in all its depth . you can exclude no sub@@ folders , unless it i@@ est into con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous folder . this allows you to add an extra@@ ordin@@ ate folder &amp; digi@@ tization ; take a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in my list will take no photos as symbols . you can change it by clicking any photo from the album and take this on the folder symbol . you will then be used as an album symbol . you will find more details about this in the albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ tised ; your digital camera set up . after that you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , so you can also handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support .
as you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy to use camera code is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and select your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tised . of course each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ tization ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to data transmission . the connection can also be realized as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tised , uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are big files and transfer over the serial port , this connection has now become obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports these cameras and automatically execute the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support created to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ ti@@ ously . the EX@@ IF @-@ support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photographs 2 , you may have pre@@ looked images potentially nothing or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in and digi@@ tization ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ tization ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ c and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it is also a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ tised ; by writing a small module to complement a function when the changes occurred in &amp; digi@@ tised , even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either switch the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop your images everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , through the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , date list or search .
- a file selection allows you to raise the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are displayed in the toolbar . thus , filtering is displayed on the fil@@ ename only when this ind &quot; tab is displayed also . which fields can be displayed in the dialog settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organized view of your photo albums . all photos , which were stored on the hard disk after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date , where the album was created first . the date may be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have installed a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into one album . you can also scan a screen photo directly to an album . select an album Im@@ ported Screen photo .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can select the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the then you can choose whether the image is moving through moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them onto the target album .
an album includes a collection of photos and album properties allowing you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , you must click with the right mouse button on the album and can edit Alb@@ um@@ Properties .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name , so that you can choose from the toolbar . if you want to add or delete albums from the toolbar . if you want to add new collections or delete albums , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums after date with view albums after date .
the buttons , average , new : they set the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . it is first trying to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; C ; the first image in the album is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a night@@ mare . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be n@@ ested .
&amp; Editor ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area of my key@@ word list on the left below in the main window . album collections have always a different effect . to the collection always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you choose an album , all images are shown on this album in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this curtain with the two lu@@ gs in the toolbar .
if you open an album the first time you need to wait shortly , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated , you can avoid that you can create new thumb@@ nails in the menu extras .
information on each image are displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are , you can set up on settings and adjust it . select here the albums and adjust the thumb@@ nail to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails feature help window . if you let the mouse over a moment over a picture . the help indicates the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot is shown above in the section introduction to the main window shows one such assistance window .
photos are all what came at &amp; digi@@ tization ; moves . albums and keywords allow you to organize your photos as it suits you . you can reach any number of improvements to this . you can reach any number of improvements to the menu . you can easily reach the menu menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between watching the pictures , a gas@@ asch@@ au or the editing of images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button click and Edit ... select a guide on how to edit your photos . with image processing , you can view your photos and change it .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fies ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button , and how you adjust them to your needs when your program is not en@@ umer@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; KDE ; manual .
you should note that after processing by other image processing programs to problems with the metadata in the picture you can &apos;t save this data from the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides two possibilities for rotating . the easiest way to click the Preview button and select rotating . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the Preview button and F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you get a photo from &amp; digi@@ tised , it will be removed in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; KDE ; f@@ 8 picture deletion or de@@ f If you prefer really Del@@ ete , you can use this by using Shift ; Ent@@ rance .
the View &amp; quot ; My data sli@@ ders &quot; organizes your photos from the data . &amp; Editor ; used either the EX@@ IF @-@ date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
once you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the file view , so that you will only be shown the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ze . keywords are sti@@ ckers that have assigned individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keywords or a search again .
when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . you can also organize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word wor@@ ste@@ al quot ; together , so you can find the keywords that you can search , easily find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and weigh@@ ted key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JPEG , stored . so you can also use your keywords in the loss of the database re @-@ imported as soon as well ; the pictures have noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking on either &amp; quot ; My keywords , or an existing key@@ word , and then choose New key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this is the sub@@ word of this one .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keywords by drag it to the desired position in the tree and drop there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in a tree at a time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the characteristics of a sampling by clicking it with the right mouse button and in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the keywords , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; s functionality with keywords allow you to first use your photos with keywords , you can draw them to the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords , drag and drop there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu of key@@ word .
you can use a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords to be weigh@@ ted words . in this way you can choose a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is shown below the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word , in which you can open the text menu of the photos and select from the tags menu . the menu shows you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ est@@ ed@@ o@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a box frame can be moved above this p@@ ist@@ o@@ gram . to select a time frame , you just have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection framework , which indicates the time unit . thus , all related images are displayed in the main window .
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , keywords , strings , dates , and in the future even more .
Neb@@ uli@@ er Search box is a small lamp where the search is found . if you click on , the filtering is deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp will be red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . you can open this search here but as a live search that has always entered the fil@@ tered what you typ@@ ed as a search criterion . after you have saved the t@@ d he filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the main window . if you want to change your search again in my search list , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in his context menu .
if you select searching , appears the form to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you want to edit any extended search , the dialog will be for advanced search for your previous search . here you can find more rules for finding your previous search . here you can find more rules for finding your previous search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Advanced Search presents you an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tised ; s database can be found .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ sian database . any option may add or delete options for a search query string . each option can be added to others about logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or minimum ... in addition , you can create seeking of the &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; create .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . it allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two pic@@ sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar . by means of a swelling , the result can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture of somewhere about the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then it will open up and you can drop it there .
sketch : open @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and sounds . find the matching images . also here , a swelling can be set .
this rider is an intuitive search tool available based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini program . you can press with the mouse wheel in or out to stick and move it . move it to the left mouse button . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your images ge@@ o data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o @-@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; puts a lighthouse in a separate window available with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em light@@ table added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open its window . if you are back in &amp; ha@@ c ; main window , you can open the ligh@@ table fast with L extras .
from the preview toolbar you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right part of the window and drop there . a small arrow displays you which copy is displayed in the toolbar . if you can preview them from the toolbar icons , then these can be executed in the other picture . so you can compare the same range of both images .
another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series . if you use p@@ air@@ wise navig@@ ating from the toolbar . now use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the left pane . the right adjacent picture is displayed in the right field . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal solvents are also working directly from the sky@@ light as e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light@@ table . this makes it e.g. easy visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each field you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to slide the visible area of the picture , you must click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; de@@ pressed . in the mode , both images are displayed in the same image area .
the zoom works just like in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ regul@@ ator under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both images when you are in the mode preview .
what is a digital component management - away from the fashion point ? digital custom@@ ary management considers every part of the process that has been made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos records a form of digital matter management through . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we view the downloading , ren@@ aming , remove , evaluate , evaluate , optimize , ver@@ qu@@ ated , archi@@ ved , waiting , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital World War management takes on , inde@@ xed , categorized , secur@@ es , trans@@ figured and exports content to a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata are defined as data about data . metadata are provided according to your definition data to provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to know more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to save as well as in image files , you will definitely use very quick search and secure archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you plan anything into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you &apos;ll have to decide whether other access to your photos will have to save whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or click on a network work &amp; etc ; notice that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you are happy with this structure . holiday images can quickly be found via your location . if you organize enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archiving , work @-@ flows , const@@ ants of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then do not want to re @-@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes forkli@@ fts simple . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
we also recommend the option to store metadata in the setup page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ tised . this is certain that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently be able to select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu Album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which to change ? to them , and select a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you can now choose any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and a review . of course you can choose the same attribute and put the value then . you start the best with the rating or the leaderboard . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos .
let &apos;s now let us know keywords , keywords , how to proceed with other programs often hot , or categories . all three are Syn@@ onyms for the same thing .
if you import tel@@ ev@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then the tree will insert the images to the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by removing a sub @-@ tree on one another . the modified keywords will be done by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ously ; updated as it tracks the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata are over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to alleg@@ ations or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ze your metadata .
you want to see most of your photos just to see , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to arrive as your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . out of distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical period of time is again present , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion thus has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who look at the title is perhaps more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key it is to transmit the importance of the viewer to help Him over the mo@@ tive that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it &apos;s the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tised , you can insert any number of text , in an international alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . KDE can even export it to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system . you &apos;ll have to tell the story for the open@@ ation period no second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? as you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now comes with light speed .
the possibilities offered by ge@@ olo@@ k@@ ization are already innumerable and become even stronger in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can export your travel to virtual . you can also export the photos at the entrance . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and means the practice to use copyrights to remove constraints on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , thus also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of &amp; digi@@ tised ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for manufacturers and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support any comm@@ as yet sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author ( syn@@ onym for Pre@@ vention ) : linked to the author . examples may be the working name of the photographer . examples for this can be title like : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer photographer . since this is a note on the author , it must be filled in this way .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who this photo offers . this must not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then here is the group / agency that offers the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . anyone who has no protection against abuse . each one of which has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify the solution to this problem are digital water@@ mark . for private individuals this is for the majority of your photos only of low interest . for professionals and half professionals , this protection is very important to this .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . &amp; , in the near future such a module for st@@ acking processing is available .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have lost on the road or a fire . these type of losses are the same which can happen to you even in traditional pap@@ er@@ photos or neg@@ atives . in this section there are problems with the New Media as well .
roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery company of the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must not be treated longer than a couple of years . of course you can also hold CDs and DVDs in archiving , which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your brass &apos;s room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you store good discs and good recording units , and use them in the right way . the best DVD recording units are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . so it turns out to select the right way .
CDs and DVDs are very pr@@ one to mistake even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and control environments . despite this massive protection , they need by chemical ag@@ eing , ul@@ tra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster this apparently causes miracles to CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications the corrupt data of damaged flo@@ ppies , hard disks , Flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to store the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost thre@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording on high quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . also read the media with a description , date &amp; author Kenn@@ signs and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and above animals protected place store . do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
flo@@ ps reserve your statistics for yourself . your manufacturer guaranteed a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the troubles@@ ome of hard drives : dis@@ cord study
in brief : discs keep on the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ate range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower temper@@ ament , these errors are not noticed . some of SMAR@@ T determined errors announce the immediate forthcoming event . these are in particular Les@@ bi@@ eh@@ ler and reloc@@ ators . the expected living @-@ time amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is just the complete over@@ lu@@ sts due to over@@ voltage . of course you also have data loss due to an electricity output before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices come not much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . you can cause serious damage to your computer . so you can cause these anom@@ ali@@ es , hardware alter@@ ations , remote mother@@ boards and other def@@ ective . protect yourself from the inevit@@ ability which results in a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ out is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed a part of energy @-@ heat and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . but remember that not every plug @-@ in line contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be careful that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 Standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning stroke and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should pay attention that also all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage support which also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable @-@ mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travel .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system will protect against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete loss . even a failure of a few seconds may result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply .
beside the protection from over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices may automatically make battery energy available when an electric loss occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and running the system . if you are buying a US@@ V then you should be sure that they perform the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting .
concern you the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security in Strom@@ ness with the cost of avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected . at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are compared to the hard drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to local data loss of most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general security solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) , and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online . the professional variant provides you more available , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the perspective of data protection , Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically generated thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies is included in the offer a backup and an active memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ secure .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integr@@ ations between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody says if it occurred in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have destroyed a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . nobody seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interference within the data flow . with normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle turn@@ out at low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for Linux and Windows . please read this article in English .
Oracle has its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha Status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % at the workplace systems . not@@ ebooks are already the proportion of theft 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most ignor@@ es . it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , travel cancellation , J@@ FS and X@@ FS in order to call the spread file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process at a sudden stop during surgery is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human mistakes are the major benefits for data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even though this resolution is rather deteri@@ or@@ ated for compact cameras and a high quality optics , the Optim@@ um for Compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
thus , a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone other for data loss . therefore , your data is often affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous like the re@@ install of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash of lightning strikes you happiness when the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster beats locally and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and theft can be dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern an entire room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ ering is always a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , you can save that of a day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files is to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at one time .
differential securing : backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two times : one of the complete locking and the last differential .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that has been changed since the last time . produces several moments . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made . this backup comes with a ver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only fl@@ ashed and not advanced .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer @-@ scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you made a complete review .
themes : metadata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , views , ... , usage of the internet .
so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider everything that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other way to do as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance to be compatible . the less variations you have used in the past . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easily it is the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of declarations in this document . use or modify open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should review your library and when necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialized print for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have entered the scal@@ ability and put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but you do not hang it .
&amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / sd@@ b # Source is / dev / sd@@ k . source is / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ et ; # works with ext@@ 2.@@ 3 , fatal 16 , 32 and reis@@ er@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software more you can read it , then you can create them yourself . this task will be made from year to year easier .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . so you should not use it anymore .
PNG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . PNG can also be relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can save in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ som@@ ing free compression salt ( de@@ fl@@ ates ) . a problem is however , that this format was adapted by many people . hence , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital neg@@ atives file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and comm@@ its for the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already made available for D@@ NG and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon will use it at some time .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .

many photographers prefer an original of your shot , mostly in raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP also fits any problems with the link between metadata and image file , and as stated above , you should think whether you are using D@@ NG as a container and put everything there together .
the Dublin core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation that supports itself for fully compatible online metadata standards , supporting a large range of operational purposes and business models . among D@@ C@@ MI , the work on a architecture and modelling , discussions and workshops , standard links and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the ticket , or the scanner . as long as the images are on the cam@@ er@@ edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for hos@@ tile editing you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the metadata again . these were under circumstances cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web@@ gal@@ eries , bo@@ iling in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tised . in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description how you can already add photos , you can already add on your hard disk , but you can add many more advanced settings to impor@@ ters of images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ sian database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it . a further description of this can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , try to connect with your camera . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not appear pre@@ tense images . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file associated to each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or metadata .
this dialog displays the file properties and photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that with some digital cameras do not provide all the information .
the tab metadata indicates the internal metadata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s remark , GPS etc . the picture . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ tization ; or the image processing . please note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then select the selection from all . this loads the photos not deleted from her camera into one single album . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired with the standard optional optional methods of &amp; KDE ; once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download the selected . the button you will download it as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these pictures have yet not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tised . in this case , the new pictures have been marked with a star in the pre @-@ showcase . if you choose this option , the new pictures will be downloaded , of course only the new pictures .
if you are using the buttons , that you can download the target album , appears in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be displayed , as usual , displayed in the section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; B came ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the button Del@@ ete All deleted . if you just want to delete some delete , so you must first select it and delete them automatically deleted .
note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; KDE ; they should be completely deleted before you delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to clear it from the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally deleted once again , if you load photos of different diameters into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for the date @-@ based sub@@ category . if you use this latter option automatically a folder will be created per day .
the options during transmission opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard authentication fields . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from EX@@ IF data into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can fix date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use e.g. in the machining field the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % H : % M : % S . turn on the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file names , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in case letters if you prefer .
the new fil@@ ename , which is entered . for a photo used , below the name appears that the camera will be available in the Preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be stored and automatically used when opening the camera .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; all information on orientation of the camera will use to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t get this information , it leaves the button in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window , use the toolbar and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
when your camera is made information about the date where the photo was made , it can be used , and select ; this can be used in the same sub @-@ album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar meta data you can check out which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case stores and digi@@ tis@@ one ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change it , you need to switch this option and select the option file based sub@@ stan@@ gle at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download . then select Upload . select the file sel@@ ector dialog &amp; KDE ; appears in which you can select the files uploaded to upload it . you can also select more than a file with the standard &amp; KDE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , queries &amp; digi@@ tised , you where the images are to be loaded high . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and click OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position meant that can be displayed in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude , and that can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to link an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten exactly where exactly the photo was taken , you can click with one click to open the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tised , users who want to locate the location of photos , it is good to document the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first you should know that exi@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and maps are supported . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera who has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS recipients . either as a card module or through transmission of the data using a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be used with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you must save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract the data from pictures and from GPS and cor@@ relate it . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre @-@ marked coordinates that can be created e.g. of map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com are not showing European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in french , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you need to select Settings . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ tization ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also with a database synchronization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Autor@@ titel is a syn@@ onym for Re@@ placement : this field should be the professional marking of the photographer . this can be design@@ ations such as advertis@@ ed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description on the author , it must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field in order to specify the photo . this must not be the author as such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here since this is the image other &amp; quot ; an@@ alog@@ ous quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency the image should be en@@ umer@@ ated here .
the IP@@ TC promotions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC field . thus , the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only entered in the database of &amp; digi@@ tization ; this metadata also contains other programs and can be imported ; imported them without any lost .
images are syn@@ ced as an in@@ built cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you have read to your photos with the images contained in the pictures . caution : in pictures that already contain signs , these are already written by the images found .
the page settings includes all options for the information that appear , when the mouse @-@ cursor in the main window over a file rests . depending on the chosen option this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ fies ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which data file types &amp; sounds . to determine which file extensions can be added and remove . each file in a &amp; digi@@ tised ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no one of these extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tised .
the default settings allows you to reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ously ; can be opened on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have turned different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ le , you should use only on quick computers . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default the image processing a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose them here . you can switch the toolbar button to use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or light colour in the image . these colors will be defined here . in the image processing , this picture Mode can be viewed with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with the adjustment of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG @-@ files . this operation is not reducing image quality , since PNG need a loss @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time for training and packaging . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : low and 9 a high compression .
with the option TIFF files compressed you can switch the de@@ fl@@ age sal@@ g@@ ts@@ .@@ m for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it reduces no influence on the image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is over@@ loaded .
with the attitude of loss free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can freely save it . even if you have written the loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size was far better than with the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the image processing was just an image folder for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing .
the default mode is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option on odd lines with more sensitive to ul@@ tra@@ violet lines , this option generates a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option shows the picture a little soft , eliminated , but the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD Quality method .
when this option is set , the white tri@@ mming of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white sli@@ ders is not set . default , it is a fixed color balance , which has been photographed on a white map that has been photographed in sunlight .
this setting will be supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the advantage of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images can get more details in the Spitz@@ ter . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is it the sh@@ red@@ ter , so the parts of your images are burned out , because of the in@@ ability of your camera em@@ itting the edge of white to the edge . the setting colours produces some unusual results , as it indicates the edge @-@ lich@@ ter in various ro@@ ar . finally , you can attempt some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ red@@ der to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast s@@ ati@@ fied as green and red . &amp; ha@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red @-@ proportions of the yet saturated blue pixel . of course this is a question how much color or wh@@ ites you like .
if you select the option you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be customized for each image separately .
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee according to your taste . you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; Editor ; image processing should be made small in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conservative .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial data sensor that have many cameras and which provides a matrix of colour pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; ha@@ v came ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gradient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ ö@@ w . it creates colored pieces on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ devi@@ ation of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can set the rot@@ or and blue @-@ correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color @-@ visual correction , since it is carried out during the pipe conver@@ ts .
a profile translate the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; sounds ; information such as the color information from a color room in the other to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
conduct issues if a picture is opened in the image processing , start / color administration module with raw files .
colour profile folder , setting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; B came ; examine this folder then during the Star@@ ts .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the Col@@ our@@ self @-@ design view is an alternative towards X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your images colored not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera body and model you &apos;re using . not all profiles are created in the same way . currently , there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain dy@@ ton@@ holes or gam@@ ma @-@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not apply to conver@@ sions at 16 bits depth . this means that you have to perform the color @-@ tone itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your printer can print a smaller paint area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated . this could be correct manually instead of leaving for the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite apparent which color profile is envisaged for what is envisaged . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is obviously in@@ official :
the Canon profile expansion can be recognized the style for the purpose : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutr@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; KDE ; Image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; KDE ; images of images and image work . by adding this interface it is possible to support , many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . select the one that you want to use , and these will then be downloaded as new entries in the menu window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the thumb@@ nails .
short command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator in@@ ates the time between the cap@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other An@@ gle fields turn off the metadata one or off , which are embedded at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic Det@@ ection , which is tried to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently you are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) - mass storage cameras from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / to specify on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tised , you need to connect the camera to your computer , connect it in the ad mode .
try out whether and digi@@ tization ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set cam@@ amo@@ del and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option confirming dialog for the moving of &gt; pictures in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can preview the conversation of &amp; sounds ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the portions of del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tised , when you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to make changes to the button changes .
they can also bind the display of the welcome screen shot from &amp; digi@@ tised ; in the circumstances it is acceler@@ ates the starting process from &amp; digi@@ tised .
the setting Bei@@ m starts after new photos , and select ; the basic folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; and when something from the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; you if it is to delete it from the database .
different shades schem@@ atic can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings allow you to select from settings design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be explored below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ tization ; to create , you will find more information about it in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of preview and editing ads .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised . so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the section portrait .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file name , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly required functions .
the machining functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saved or the button save from the toolbar . please note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the photo .
so you should possibly have a copy of your image before you change it . this lets you perform with file saved .
as long as you do not have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu file recovery or use the button The button Re@@ manufacture of image processing restore in the toolbar . you then lose any change that you have performed at the photo since the last store .
nearly every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ one by selecting the editing process or to be restored by selecting machining back from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to return , and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ connect .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back @-@ to or restore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are also revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar . if you have any changes on the current photo , you will ask if you want to save it .
you can click in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the reverse menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
viewing full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you do not want to use the toolbar button . normally , you can also change this in the setup dialog from &amp; digi@@ tised . you can view this from the &amp; C ; main window . see the section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select image file image and get the default &amp; KDE ; print dialog . you can customize settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases . whole image pages can be printed from your choice . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ por@@ tees printers . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation panel , also in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked :
multiple @-@ aches Click on the same tab allow the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
in the prot@@ ection@@ ery view , you can insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size or insert . notice the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated according to 2000 characters and special characters are shaped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you commented that you have commented on either the button or simply change the next picture , the signs will then be saved .
besides the apply @-@ button there is one button More . with this you can write more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also use the metadata in the files . however , this will always be done if you have selected a metadata default that is always written in the pictures .
the section review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single click on the side bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several pictures at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . encoding is followed by the schema in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; digi@@ ous keywords .
the key@@ word tree is adjusted dynamically to the desired search word . you can quickly limit the number of ways in finding a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have lots of keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
when multiple images are selected in the main view , and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , it will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the page header section is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally the left side bar will be used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keywords , and view@@ points . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filter is used from the right , only the cutting @-@ quantity of these two is displayed . all provided keywords are available .
you can also drag keywords and drop them . suppose you have selected several images in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection . subsequently , a dialog you ask if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper case , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords , which sets the amount to three pictures . they were chosen with C@@ trl + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word @-@ tree was drawn to the selection and filed there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . you can also be turned aside in settings various settings .
if you have a rule with and have created and determine that it should be one or be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , which is looked for in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already placed in the database .
for example , you can set a Ex@@ tended search on all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the tick @-@ field at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . see the options as follows :
why not listed pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly got it up &amp; digi@@ tised , s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color@@ less workflow , the colors that from your camera or scanner can have a predictable vari@@ ance from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors available on your monitor those from your camera or scanner , and you may publish the colors you print or publish in the web that are coming from your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons it must push for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions about color management . additionally , you will have links with further information allow your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image is fulfilled all six below criteria then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB color foam . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image rates are by email or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everybody so easy , why should one use another color room and thus have to worry about paint noise ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional reproduction of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and colours in the s@@ R@@ GB color room , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color trees , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms and click info and then click Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
must I k@@ alli@@ ble my monitor if I have decided to work only in s@@ R@@ GB color room ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB color piece or not , you have to work your monitor cal@@ li@@ cky , since s@@ R@@ GB it is proceeding out of the circle . if you work as a color foam of s@@ R@@ GB , then you need to either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , using a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt a further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , comparing the same and contrast from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ dly Automatic correction is automatically trying out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best works on your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method will scale the lumin@@ ance over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its colour sh@@ aded . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed .
compar@@ isons : this method adju@@ sts the illumin@@ ates of the colors of the selected image so that the h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram of the integer can be as shallow as possible . sometimes , the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only the rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles with a picture or destroyed it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . they determined the dark and bright border @-@ tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the complete h@@ ist@@ o@@ grams .
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in h@@ uss@@ ed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white tri@@ cked away from &amp; digi@@ tised ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ coated of a photo .
the white @-@ straight correction is somewhat limited as there is a color room with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can perform too far from original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur , which is in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correction is better off .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ m@@ tu@@ ce of the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ y@@ m is protected . you start it via the menu items white @-@ like of image processing .
the curtain can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target audience . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original protein , then it is enough to click the bottom window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ anz of the pixel , under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram .
to the right above , a hi@@ st@@ o@@ gram is displayed , as soon as you change a parameter . this hi@@ st@@ gram is very helpful , even in well illuminated pictures , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shade of adjusting can you improve the shots of your photos or also download it .
to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . click on this button and then click anywhere on the thumb@@ nail to use the color temperature of the whit@@ eboard . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white section with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the excess indicator indicator increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. you will display the combined result in the white @-@ channel . this is shown in the preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . each adjustment of the whit@@ eboard you have set , you can save it into a text file and then load again later .
the button pres@@ ets pres@@ upp@@ oses all fil@@ ter@@ values back to its standard values and the associated neutral whit@@ ef@@ it . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
you can set here the codi@@ les for each colour channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding requires also more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and stands just for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the helmets . a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found in the chapter color@@ administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors key correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time . this is helpful to make use of it for multiple photos . this is helpful when your camera or scanner always need the same correction and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for a sound @-@ correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gradient in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool color effects provides you with four color effects , a solar output effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a bell filter available .
in times of chemical processing , solar inter@@ pol@@ arization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ ans , a effect of the arose . the colored , dark areas shel@@ tered the delicate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier of the additional light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ test areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine .
the intensity control the solar organization . with approximately 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally produces a negative image that is not to be seen on phot@@ op@@ i@@ ier .
this is an example of solar effects . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is at 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a s@@ ati@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ sting effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , he em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vet offers very saturated color with day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color , but also some photographs , especially those of which are barely landscapes .
Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light to the contra@@ sting . the parameter levels controlled the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . with large pictures the filter can rel@@ ieve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contra@@ sting of your photos with the tools in the menu . all your Jus@@ ti@@ ations can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the inver@@ ted problem : a great choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of raising it . all changes that you can carry out you can preview in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lamp volume / contrast / gam@@ ma the tool is a key correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need for the use described in this tool only the area of shal@@ e . concrete the three shooting below the h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram .
the window contains a graphs of intensity , a du@@ st@@ o@@ gram , the active channel or of the selected range . under graphs are three shooting into the entered and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to use the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the regul@@ ator and to take care of how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . preview is dynamically based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selective box can be set , whether the H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram comes with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera is often the linear representation of a single column . in this case , the log@@ istic H@@ ist@@ o@@ gram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is useful .
three regul@@ ator : the top for the dark tones , the mean for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes , often gam@@ ma @-@ values .
the three color brush can be used in the pre@@ image of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of output values can be used for example , to create a hidden picture as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and re@@ charged later on it will use the Gimp format .
if you use this mode and the three hu@@ p@@ aces , the input values will automatically be replic@@ ated for all shade , means and Sundays . activate the original pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the thumb@@ nails of the hi@@ sto@@ gram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channels .
the option of over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect shown only in the Preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target picture is displayed . the Preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
Modi@@ fy Channel : this selection box allows the channel to enter the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and one log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images included with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of sensu@@ ous mode . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beams . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
if you move e.g. a board down to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones with dar@@ ker &apos;s output files are dar@@ ker .
the preview of the original photos is to see a red marker . if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change the original value . create a dot on this line and move it up and down until the value is judicial to your taste .
save as and shop : with these buttons , you can make exactly this . each bend which you can create can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format is used for Gimp .
if you are using this method and the three color p@@ aces settings automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and Sundays . activate the color p@@ pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image for the rot@@ or , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option of over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the result displayed only in the Preview and it &apos;s no effect to be seen at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and sunny tones were set with the shade of the paint and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ y ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly @-@ developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of image processing .
with the channel optional box you can select the color for the p@@ ist@@ o@@ gram : this gives you a first hint of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the goal image has a red marker . if you stand this in the picture a vertical line appears in the h@@ ist@@ o@@ gram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you modify L@@ umin@@ anz , because the channel mix@@ er then is DA@@ S tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color leads to a visible ru@@ stling of color , which comes from the color channel , and their smoking patterns in every channel looks different . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion thus in which you will reduce the color first .
the storing as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender attitude allows you to save it for later and then load . the file format is multi @-@ channel mix@@ er format .
the option of over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect shown only in the Preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture newly opened in the blue channel . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / White photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / White is a working step , as colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ ment profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good at all the scene images and fits particularly well with portraits of the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a or@@ acle lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and a@@ erial photos . thus similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ filmed .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic sky @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ ies at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) red filter .
gel filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color @-@ correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ b@@ filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while he added a bit col@@ dness in the sh@@ ading tree . this is very similar to the process of failure of a printing and re@@ development in a sep@@ tic on@@ ator . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture can apply you to apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind Portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry picture can be used for it .
relief : shift that parameter to the right raises the semb@@ lance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the picture .
a paper collection effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep its attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the eye eye . under picture frames the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter you place the desired cream type for your image . thoroughly round the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce um@@ ran@@ ged it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button @-@ effect and decoration adds an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percentage . the value area for width is 1 % to 50 % limited .
that with the frame dec@@ ayed goal is greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into an image on any point . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with your mouse . use text instrument , orientation , color from the color room and the character set with its characteristics as you need it . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be . for the end you simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sigh@@ ted background . already , the picture is ready .
any attitude that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; after the picture was saved , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore .
when inser@@ ting the tool template , you can apply a template via a picture .
the menu image painting can be used in the image processing can be used to specify sc@@ enc@@ ils over a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the PNG file format , and should add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template , so you simply send an e @-@ mail in English to die &amp; scan ; mailing list Set@@ ting @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
when you use this tool for the first time , you have to put your template folder with the button basic folder in dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template file . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root @-@ folder for the sten@@ cil has been set , a building view , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder , the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cil .
under the Preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
res@@ ins : this button res@@ ized the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must res@@ p the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image , then the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumb@@ size .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; provides three different tool to ac@@ ut@@ eness . each one of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen is a traditional tool to shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , however , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture shar@@ per . actually , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual Dun@@ st . you can use it to get atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ viewing is perhaps the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ tised images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this in turn leads to a common color to a color point . this also leads to sharp edges a little bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more slow@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG @-@ pictures frequently a camera has been applied to internal ac@@ ut@@ eness . images in the raw format on the contrary must always be processed during the processing .
some scanner turn a tigh@@ tening filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable them , you get in control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by getting a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value chain . you can call the menu entry into Cor@@ rigi@@ dity .
you should be careful with caution because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general the need to focus on a picture the tool re@@ focus on . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for ac@@ ut@@ eness .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to record the picture a little soft , is much easier than it shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry variable and experiment some with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview will help edit the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values will produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strongly , smoke and the impression of gr@@ ats are in the vicinity of sharp edges .
the radius is how many pixels on each side are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage being added between the original and the pic@@ tured image one that is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the tail @-@ value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference . you can thus define a minimum difference to the edges of the filter . this way , areas with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen and therefore flaw in facial , cel@@ esti@@ cks and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a tail value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing is focused on an image by enhancing the edge of the field . it used the copyrighted design algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to raise a picture . it is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener filtering . you can easily run it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focusing in the image processing .
in practice the circular f@@ ission works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche f@@ ission has a very long tail , which is leading to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen f@@ ission is influenced in most cases , even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . it causes unwanted results .
circular ac@@ ut@@ eness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should result 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red then but to hal@@ o .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation can help reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the tough@@ er effect of the module .
smo@@ ker filters : an increase in the smoking filters can help you to reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will make the image even further .
gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s edge . in most cases , you should not use this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may need to also increase the cor@@ relation and / or the smoke filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , an increase of the matrix size can have good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular edge or the gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen field . note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will then be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cutting , color and Int@@ osh correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture in any other way . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes which are not immediately visible are left un@@ enjoyable art@@ e@@ facts .
if you have pictures read and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; when JPEG , you should use the module to un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results as ac@@ ut@@ eness . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as ac@@ ut@@ eness .
theoretically , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king must always generate art@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of tough@@ er filters . virtually , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ as is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this picture was made using an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
for more information on the methods of the field correction in digital photos , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regul@@ ator smo@@ o@@ thing puts the bl@@ ur of the area which was kno@@ cked out to generate a natural pair of p@@ up@@ ille .
the ink duct enables a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool mis@@ align@@ ing is one of the most advanced tools to not remove desired arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the invention algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ o@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a ev@@ enly belie@@ ver over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should therefore receive details so that no depth is necessary . please note that the detailed specification shall always be subordin@@ ated to the direction of direction .
right @-@ dependent Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es in all directions while a value is near to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film @-@ gra@@ ins or CCD spac@@ ers will generate a high value to wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
&#91; 0 , 500 &#93; This sets the maximum smo@@ o@@ thing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smo@@ o@@ thing . therefore set this value perfectly to the degree of smoking in your picture .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : returns how often the algorithm is going through . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ cutting da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha small selected , there should also be small selected . so make sure that small angles have a long run time . so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral part &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step@@ per cent in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ o@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . it doubles the running time . we therefore recommend it to allow it .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . every setting of image errors can be corrected to a text file and re@@ charged later on .
correct image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the shut@@ down .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is made on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you see there is a peculi@@ ar black arti@@ fact in the foreground , that is caused by a bad movie storage during the trip ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyright algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable images available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens , to remove . it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or mo@@ tions ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensors of digital cameras , you can read them in English this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you just need the sub @-@ window details and the sub @-@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings .
radius controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the image indicated by the radius is moving about the image and the color in it is saved and therefore minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value raises the pixel up to the front . if it is lifted you will change the edges filter . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer be preserved and ru@@ stle or lubrication occurs once again .
edges : controls the edge precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or smoke @-@ tips can occur . put it on a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a f@@ aint noise or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the Gl@@ ati@@ ation process controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color @-@ toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the Gl@@ ati@@ ation process controlled by the details -@@ settings .
gam@@ ma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically are ampli@@ fied to increase . however , he also consumed the shadow ranges .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the bending radius . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted when it is too high can occur . if he is on his minimum , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it .
save and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
sometimes , an image is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to record the picture a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry into speci@@ fies differently and experiment with the smo@@ o@@ thing . the window display on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographic record .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of und@@ es@@ irable arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adjusted to emerge in digital , original or retro@@ actively digi@@ tised images , to remove . the smo@@ o@@ thing is done along the image cont@@ ours and thus receives the content as it is also the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for colour and text composition . the text composition is carried out with another tool , the image editor , carried out . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ che and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ e@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a loss of compression compression , he produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ art@@ quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ compressed image . this attitude should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and store exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and re@@ charged later on .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load for itself . hence , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped ru@@ stle .. The module is applied to a black and white photo recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gran@@ ularity on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected one under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo recorded with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts that were caused by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; tool hot@@ bed permits the hot@@ bed of photos which were created with a CCD camera , eight were used to remove . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with an dark@@ est sub@@ stitution method . there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to enter the dark picture directly in the port to detect new hot or bright pixel by the CCD .
first , as described in the previous section , you should upload the dark picture to the corrected picture . note that the wizard shows the last dark@@ est picture and this automatically loads back to the next meeting .
the image and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken out in all processes .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the Preview and see the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ling these pixel poles . these are the filters available :
thir@@ sty : there is an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixels are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ k@@ ub@@ ische surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of k@@ ub@@ ine curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ spot correction on a color photo , from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged by 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; vig@@ net@@ ting error is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
expan@@ sive objective , especially the central and large photo @-@ format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tele@@ objective show under circumstances also this behavior .
but he also has cons . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . vast@@ ness object should also use with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects arise through motion .
with the great popularity of today &apos;s film and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ @-@ filter by using a equi@@ val@@ ency transformation in a raw material that is applied without this filter . the tool of vig@@ net@@ ting is applied to a picture . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker .
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting @-@ correction filters and with three further expos@@ ing the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density the filter . the default density is 2,@@ 0 , which compens@@ ate an optical filter with a aper@@ ture adjustment of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ thickness , contrast and gam@@ ma @-@ settings : the image of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting error reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target audience with these options . the regul@@ ator will provide you only positive values as you just need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re @-@ tuning of the target audience , so leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma with zero and use the gradient option from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting error in an image applied . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ting image in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ance and contrast @-@ correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gradient covers the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third gradient has a similar gra@@ ff@@ ing effect , fla@@ cht on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des can be corrected the remote corners opposite to the second gradient . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be eliminated almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ der . with negative values , tons of valves can be corrected and positive values co@@ ci@@ zed distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gradient . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter general .
zoom : this value scal@@ ates the image size and thus leads to correction first gradient . negative values increase during positive the picture .
brigh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog box with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the tons and medium @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all tri@@ mming or size changes . in case you have to cut a picture anew and then perform a tons @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be the apparent of the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it into an important place like e.g. the se@@ ash@@ ore or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the tons / k@@ cr@@ atic distor@@ tion using the help of the lines .
if you have a col@@ os@@ ci@@ ous distor@@ tion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can transform them with the cutting tool in the menu transforming cutting from image processing or through the zoom regul@@ ator of this dialog .
for most images , the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page within this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the Preview , you can set two parameters to sim@@ ulate film gran@@ ularity and film@@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the gran@@ ular texture of a high @-@ sensitive film . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of film gran@@ ularity and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green law@@ ns are white as snow !
since the filter colors are mis@@ used to reproduce inf@@ ra film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white @-@ photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effects applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a type of au@@ ra in the sh@@ red@@ der .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter diagrams are an easy to use tool to reproduce film @-@ gra@@ ins on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of movies , the manufacturer mix major disc liqu@@ eur of the photo em@@ ulsion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ening of daily life . in case you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mono@@ chrome photos , so you have to use this filter .
with the regul@@ ator the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the bas@@ ins . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of screening effects on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyrighted material protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the top sel@@ ects the p@@ inch size between one and five . thicker brush are suitable for big pictures . smo@@ ked controls the smo@@ o@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sing@@ ularity .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is characterized by the ( 1 ) and the ir@@ worked is marked with the ( 2 ) . p@@ adding size for this 640 pixels big image is 1 and smo@@ ked 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ tis@@ one ; filter coal @-@ drawing used color - and Int@@ ensity gradient to create a ca@@ vities in the drawing . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to create you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ator with a value @-@ range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower the contrast ( glow ) .
this is an example of the carbon pass filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the performance value .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a copyright algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to resume your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ily landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of filtration . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and lets it look as if it is considered by gl@@ ass@@ y blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the wav@@ el@@ blocks 1 will distor@@ ted the image here in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of bl@@ ur@@ red effects . it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ al lines that go from a center . this sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur a zo@@ omed camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al dis@@ cord : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by rotation of the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removal of removal : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to appear in the background .
motion bl@@ iss@@ ors : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
sof@@ tening har@@ ness : wi@@ t the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle light .
scar@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by random variation of pixels and sim@@ ulates the bl@@ ur of any random camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes this without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button .
the rain drops are a cute little tool to make rain drops in your picture . thus it gives natural your images a n@@ asses appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by protected algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the tro@@ ps . since the dro@@ ple@@ t size is not automatically growing with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the op@@ tic effect of drops on the picture .
you can stick with the &amp; scan ; image processing a field free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you start the filter rain drops in the area , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it by mirrors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transform or transform mirrors .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo for a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to res@@ ist is simple . the big question is how can you hold an image infl@@ ating and the details sharp@@ ly ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can one find the missing information again ? how can one find the missing information again ? how can one find the missing information again ? try it here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . dialog is below to see .
the tool to size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tization ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
aspect ratio follows : if this adjustment is activated , when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as well as store will be exactly used . each plug @-@ in for photo can be saved as a text file and re@@ charged later on .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes but it can still take a very long and a high CPU load for itself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ atable , by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enhancement to compare .
cutting a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . you simply need to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle . you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse .
if you leave the mouse button again the area of photos will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can drag the size of the to cut area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle by pressing it simply by clicking the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button The addition @-@ button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save File Save File Save as a file to save the newly used photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the higher value of height and width is assigned to the width .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you can use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ i@@ ards and their aspect rati@@ os .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons are automatically horizontal or vertically to centre .
below in a dialog you can set up with the Max . relationship button the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of contrac@@ tion help allow yourself to engage in help so that you can put your pictures better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic sub @-@ forms are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ party , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
Golden Age : the golden center is a division taking over various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the bl@@ ur@@ ls of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you have already used the ancient Egyptians and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos put together to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 and etc ; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding figures . the present divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that is usually follows as visually harmon@@ i@@ ously .
the golden centre makes liquid lines available when you put an image together . these help will be en@@ umer@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring your aim to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party , the golden spiral generates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the rectan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden angles . it should be used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this one can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the Golden tri@@ angles are also guided by the above listed golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , Golden tri@@ angles are no similar tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can place a static object dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame and create an effect of by professional photographers dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to place your image film at one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divi@@ ding .
with the button Color you can set the color of relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image for any angle .
if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you &apos;re not exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are around a corner . you can fix this with the &amp; scan ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose free rotation and tuning the target angle .
turn your picture with the s@@ late angle . the values on that sliding are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degree . preview the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right .
to your help , the module provides free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line available . move the mouse cursor in the image preview for the two lines . after you have moved it via an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transforming it out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . notice the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas that are created by transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas that were created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right up : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right of the transformed area .
after the adjustment of the perspective the image will be a bit wast@@ ed . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have attached the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to mention this is the picture with transform cutting out of image editing .
the tool tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parallel ram . you can start this module about transc@@ end@@ lessly .
sc@@ rolling your picture by using the horizontal angles and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . preview the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the screen .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the shot , the picture becomes a bit wis@@ ely . for a single ring this effect is usually neglected , but two types of producing twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the closing the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is the image with transform cutting out of image processing .
&amp; digi@@ tization ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ iling have been comp@@ iling . in most distribu@@ tions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tised .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats available on their system . but you will always be JPEG and TIFF .
&amp; Editor , only files in formats which knows . this happens through the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will be displayed , and select this list of file extensions that can be expanded . in the section configuration you will find further information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format used format . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ tization ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression to digital images . the redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data to an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results as JPEG with the same compression mode . the 200@@ 0s version can also save lu@@ stro@@ p if it is stated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can see raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw material converter from &amp; digi@@ tised . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ tised , supported the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which in &amp; digi@@ tised . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats which came from &amp; digi@@ tised .
many digital cameras support the recording a short movies . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . but , this formats and will look for films generate films or editing . when you click on a movie file , and select ; the &amp; KDE ; settings to play movies to play the program to play .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast was already very good then you can perform the first four adjusting entries with the white module .
many tools you need to use the photo machining are available in &amp; digi@@ tised , included . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , cra@@ p @-@ op@@ ting , re@@ focus , un@@ focuss@@ ing , bl@@ ur , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialogue type that will show the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; tex@@ tured quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter at the current picture . on the left of it , you will allow five buttons to change the compar@@ ular mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
vertically split without duplic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview range .
horizontal divide without duplic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview range .
vertically split . the left section shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper section shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be used to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general introduction page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the Preview . you can drop this frame with the mouse inside the picture and take a look at the part of the picture from which you can preview the preview of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings are marked from the last use of the module .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the chosen image and is mostly in@@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters during shooting the photos . these data are provided by the EX@@ IF data when it is available .
this rider is an intuitive search tool available based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini program . you can press with the mouse wheel in or out to stick and move it . move it to the left mouse button . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your images ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ all@@ ets files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and naming colors .
the pal@@ etts files , which are installed by &amp; KDE , can either apply for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; KDE ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and Zul@@ te used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folders according to files .

&amp; sounded viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; images are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . previously there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; program designed to visualize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; sounded viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical surface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; KDE program .
&amp; sounded viewer ; is a KDE program for watching &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; images are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays Grap@@ h with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; KDE ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graphs are re@@ calculated and displayed in &amp; sounded ;
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to present more than that k@@ not )
additional software required : &amp; sounded viewer ; is a &amp; KDE , program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail :
the main window shows the opened graph@@ ene , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; sounded , the main window is empty like in the bottom of the screen photo . in this case , the toolbar icons only contains the symbol file and the ( blank ) list Zul@@ ed opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the bottom of the scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the Grap@@ h is larger than the character position . you can select a fixed position in this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
the mouse wheel ( high and r@@ below without special ta@@ sts , left and right in pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ button ) ;
the zoom is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graphs .
if the file is currently installed in &amp; k@@ graphically ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; may change your decision later on . should you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphically viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you open a graph , outside of an ongoing &amp; conc@@ graph viewer : an instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you &apos;ll have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; sounded viewer / instance or want to display the graphs in a sub@@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option you can permanently save your choice but also change it with the interior dialog .
at the program start you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as later change .
you can also specify how the graphs should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs are to be displayed on a page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the respective parts of the graph .
side preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without a header line and with another font
the Det@@ ect loading site gives the ability to set the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charging or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the page Open gives the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graphs open in a new window or specify in a window of the already current session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the seat management site gives the opportunity to specify the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer . you can open a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine , with each start to be asked .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layouts algorithms . the entries on how they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for oriented graphs . he produces hierarch@@ ical or histor@@ ies of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ equ@@ ated graphs . it produces depic@@ tions in accordance with the spring@@ board model . it is used by the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai @-@ algorithm that is syn@@ onymous with statistics of multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; the algorithm creates a spring@@ board model @-@ model layout . it uses the fruit @-@ man @-@ source code and includes a surplus @-@ proof for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm ranks the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and Kau@@ ff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cir@@ cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog , where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell , and the calculation layout of the graphs after st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format can provide you &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or also change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graphs ( directed or un@@ ted ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for direc@@ tional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ equ@@ ated graphs ) .
if this adjustment is activated , the overview is displayed , provided that this is necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse pointer . click with this pointer to a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the source folder of the source file .
&amp; sounded viewer ; is a &amp; KDE , program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it needs the following program packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; sounded viewer . in the menu settings you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol Editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for character tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette , and the grid system , in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will ask if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog you can choose if the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew .
put the last revers@@ ed step again . if you do not have taken step back , this function is disabled .
adds the content of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not match with those of the icon palette of &amp; KDE .
not change the icon , but sets the current character color on the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing space , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the content of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images included provides tools to read new pictures and add them down .
this module can be used to invite new images to read from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : used the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports through the SA@@ NE project or another source like e.g. Video Stre@@ ams . so that this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
if you scan the menu entry images , a dialog you can choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to pick the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the pre@@ given default values duc@@ er can replace your image accordingly . see the preview below and adjust the range of your needs before you read the image . the estimated file size will show you in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
note that the window will be completely displayed as some settings otherwise may not be shown .
once you have pushed the button scanning the button you have to wait until the scan will be completed and the window will specify the option of the image file . please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you &apos;ll also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image should be saved .
screen photos can create after you selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ ters &gt; Screen photo ... selected . a window appears in which you can adjust the various screen f@@ ot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work@@ space click to read a single window under the mouse .
if all own application window is selected , the open program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be read after a short delay , the currently visible work place . if you have selected the complete work@@ space , the window will be read only under the mouse .
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you turn off on other work@@ space , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
once the scre@@ enshot is made , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above .

Flickr is an online photo management on the internet . with Flickr , it is possible to send the photos to the people who are important . you can place your favourite photos of the world online and show your photos safely and privately your friends and your family all over the world .
the module Ex@@ por@@ ters to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
when you use the module for the first time , you will be run through the process of generating a to@@ kens . so it is always used for your authentication . a browser will be started so you can login to Flickr .
after successful registration , the module can send pictures to the Flickr Web site . you will be presenting the following page after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pushed back yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module begins to Flickr on Flickr for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current permissions . the module now also supports other permissions . you will not be asked if you want to proceed with those permissions .
the button Photos should once be pushed once once you have put all the other options . with this button you can select the photos that you want to upload . if you press on the O@@ k button click the upload of the photos to the Flickr Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a separated list of words . these are added to the image as a keywords during the flood .
with the options open , friends and fam@@ illi@@ e you can set the permissions to your images . by default the photos are classified as a private .
if you choose the option change the size of photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the maximum size of a maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio changed .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Imaging @ c@@ de.@@ or@@ g. note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation allows GPS coordinates to add and edit in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools available for images geo@@ graphically in the spher@@ ical system of coordinate , which is used by GPS and Galileo , to locate . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as a XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Geo@@ graphic localization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to run the menu above . to load a possible cor@@ relation between time and localization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation carried out the coordinates into red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera connections should be converted to the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set here your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum period devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ er@@ time . is the devi@@ ation below , including the data are merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have any trace data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add the pictures to the images . the difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min. can be used if you do not have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality is a locality between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set with this dialog . this is useful when you &apos;ve made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog will be able to hit the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found with the indicated map to and after and placed . select this in the appropriate region and enlarge you . the height must always be selected manually . the card can always be selected manually . the map can be exchanged between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded by UT@@ F @-@ 8 to achieve the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows all the albums to choose which will be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s image defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely explained by itself . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be displayed in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the picture is displayed directly with your default screen , on eg ; C@@ ick@@ show show .
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related images . select a folder on which you are writing . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF data of your original images will also be saved in the new pictures .
with other color depth you can change the standard color depth . of course , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails which are small images displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to break down the process .
if the module generates the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore start the program@@ ties to determine whether errors during the generation appeared . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . click Close to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture error is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture visu@@ als allows you to watch a selection of pictures and use them base operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or distor@@ tion . the viewer can be used with short @-@ missing and mouse @-@ clicks . it was developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in the JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the cut @-@ free storage is that the file size rises , since no compres@@ sing of colour information is taking place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Imaging @ c@@ de.@@ or@@ g. note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata @-@ Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list KDE @-@ Imaging @ c@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import -@@ function of metadata modes , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image optional dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after you have pushed the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere else but not in any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please take a look at exi@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ spo@@ ilt .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video with a defined length , convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image editing . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of Di@@ ash@@ au .
all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can choose a background color for the slides . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program only .
you must first choose the pictures to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . after that you can create the module &apos;s extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting of images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ tor or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is indicated below . the speed of the image is specified below , below . a lower value creates a very sudden , a high level of a very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the created file you can set under name of MPEG @-@ output file . keep in mind the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify an audio file using the name of the audio source file , then this will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences , you can now move with the button code to drink the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to drink a coffee and enjoy the di@@ ppers once you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ y@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Packages to the right below .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper along with standard photography sizes . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with image processing Gimp . this is e.g. sensible to improve your or using the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original theme of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera body . sometimes you get better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re@@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the white , brightness and red / blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ color R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected for you to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged image format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses the ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you are going to process your images frequently or you later use later , you should not choose the JPEG format since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that are included in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button to start converting the conversion . if you want to cancel this process again , so you can use it .
the st@@ acking mode allows you to convert various images at once . use this mode so if you are sure , e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , here you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion progress is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , start @-@ up number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the one .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . to this end , four types of images are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed during this option .
preparation preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ i@@ ers . the target picture , including background size , size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the dis@@ appearing images before . further images can be drawn on the list of the images to be displayed and stored there .
after you started the module , the images can be shown with the images you selected . over the button images you can add additional pictures with a file sel@@ ector dialog . for the last selected image will be a preview on the right side .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list and add it to the list of the pictures to be displayed .
with the button images , the selected images will be removed from the list of the images to be removed .
once you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected have already been attached to the app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay attention to many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of the e @-@ mail address . it may possibly send a good idea several mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is stored and every time again uses until you change it .
select your email clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird so you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer in advance . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file you will add the comments to the images in a text file and attached the mail .
the PNG format under the menu Images File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ som@@ ing free formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in the JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the appearing pictures .
if the process is finished , the window will not automatically closed down to you to view the status messages , looking for errors . your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . with the button Close you can sh@@ out this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au you will have a window with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation will use very elegant image transfers using OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , since otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the option file names show that the fil@@ ename can display images in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop . you can manually add them to Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly choose that the images are shown in a random order . so it will not be used the order of images in the album .
under delay between images can be set between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transfer effect . you should so check this before you show the presentation your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly choose another effect in each transition between images .
during the di@@ asch@@ au you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you off .
using this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides .
at the left side of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under KDE @-@ Imaging @ c@@ de.@@ or@@ g. note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set up a picture as a background image for the surface .
this module combines the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image are now available in every group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories , for which you have entered information when you have given your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each one is described .
if you press the mouse on the entry , changes the browser view . see the picture .
if you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of pictures shown from a few thousand images to a couple of individual images .
if you have selected all the individuals , places and other settings , you can preview with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your impact .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . however , you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however for each person a separate preview image , This of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined themselves . see for this the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button that you want to use right outside on the toolbar . please note that you can use the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with pictures of people and simultaneously a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images for your keywords ) .
you have to specify yourself , which is to be displayed for each individual person . to view this , you &apos;ll have to view the picture An@@ si@@ eve window ( in closer ) and in the context menu you can select the picture for the corresponding person . in the An@@ si@@ eve window you can customize the picture factor to your preferences and to select which part of the image should be displayed or cut .
if you visit the entry entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the fixed image properties . this dialog you can look at the picture once again .
if you enter a string in the field of let@@ tering or description , you can also enter a date that will be searched for ; the date may be either a part of the product date , so for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images after certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , though not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals but rather try out the functions , you have the following alternatives to this guide :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the Quick Start , the Screen photos and the introductory videos .
start the demo album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entries . as a result , some example @-@ images can be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different periods of time . each body then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units of months , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline you can use in the following ways ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the Preview button ) and also displays the tim@@ eline always the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in the Preview View .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps , drag . if you select an area , you will be displayed in the Preview View only images of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated into &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which allows you to create using the menu of HTML ...
before HTML pages , you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following each area is exactly described .
first enter the title of the bli@@ cks and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . nutritional information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed on the HTML pages . for example , that all pictures of a party are obvious . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all pictures are exported . you can not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain point of view .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are clear why not specifically stated on this .
below you can set different resolutions for images below . by doing so , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images to download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the spect@@ ator of your site can change the resolution at any time . so he can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , as well . if he wants to display a picture larger he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folders and the URL that your website is stored .
it is best to select all your HTML files and select a new sub@@ folder for all your HTML files .
first , you have to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for example :
once you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all available for viewers . if you have created a web browser for the basic folder . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final target folder you &apos;ll need to manually copy them manually . to enable the import function , see correctly , you must specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described , all three are related to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name will define you in your output folder .
if you &apos;re on a family business , a meeting at the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already paid a lot of time to contempl@@ ate the images , then you have to write with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not even make .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image features are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . you differ in it if the images are stored in the file or if in the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage is to store all pictures together and that file can be distributed so independently . the obvious disadvantage is however the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the menu file or create together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two ways . first the corresponding images are not found , so the pictures of the URL you are specified when creating HTML files . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ in file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog will be described for exporting images that can be accessed via the File menu .
the most important option of this dialog is to act in internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
in the Manual un@@ plug near the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with option Autom@@ atically copy it to the .@@ k@@ im file copy copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it &apos;s usually not worth the files to comp@@ ress . if you want to do so , just choose the option export file .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by adding for example that every picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select , &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for Im@@ ported consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import them , in which folder to import images to be copied .
it can be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the to imported file person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is in case of your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which are to be imported into the categories of the to imported file and what categories that are in your database .
the fourth step allows you to import the categories of the selected file with the categories of your present database . an example of this can be seen on the picture .
it has to be simple to browse and look at : when you look at pictures , one would often want to see images within different pic@@ tured groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend to it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this hand@@ book , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) to locate information about your pictures , over ( 2 ) searching and reputation , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ t@@ ability .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for managing your images . but it was expanded and today it also takes your videos . at many places in this hand@@ book will be talked about paintings , but often it also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all his information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of her pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal locking tools , just copy on a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and uses it automatically . if you want to read a different database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in case you have a different folder tree with pictures , you can launch a different folder tree ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
through the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you reach a window where you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can invo@@ ke settings and view the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available that you can call by a key@@ press on the F1 key and a click on the desired option .
it has been described as you can define for each picture of different properties , e.g. people , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog , which is used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , rather than explained in a group membership .
in the list of settings for you to set up the membership groups , you can choose the category . with the above listed selection list , you can select the category with the current category and in the right a list of categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphic applications such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; KDE ; Image Plugin interface . nutritional information on this can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed via the menu modules . the modules can be called and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves .
since the modules can be used together with multiple applications , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can always be tested first with the demo database before comm@@ itting them to your own pictures . you can either call the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned !
the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I are very different , thus allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; cold album ; not work . this is the disadvantage if you share features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; cold album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this type of order does not support , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; acoustic album .
sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture shows at the moment .
next to the current album has to record &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes down &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category individuals , so do not matter if you were selected to view it and pass this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select in the modules that are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of a start@@ up screen once you start &amp; photo album ; with your own pictures .
as you are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it from any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu , and a toolbar . at the moment we don &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will return to this window , now click on the pictures to show you an overview with all the existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to see any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , etc . you can set any picture either separately or for a larger number of images . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these comments may be used for searches and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the in@@ built viewer .
in a look at three lists using a text field by choosing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ graphies ; as you will always use them again if you submit information about your images .
the following idea is the shifting of images within the list : if you have a family celebration , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , you can make sure that the names used up are moved upwards to find people faster and be assigned .
if you prefer to list a alphabe@@ tical list , click on the icon for sorting by date on the list .
if you have chosen notes to each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item for multiple entries at a time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window in the USA as a survey . to show you that it is a survey , a special symbol is shown .
in the context menu of the catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new super@@ structure or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry into a category and drop there to make this one sub@@ category this entry . attention , this assumes that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the component , by clicking the glue that form the edge of the frame , click on it . you can also make your own window as well as drag it outside of the window .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings that you have the option to store the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the button options ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry images in your browser , you get an overview with pre@@ views of the currently selected images , or any images if you have no filter . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy .
if you leave a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will be displayed in the picture code . if you don &apos;t have a window opened with an image open , a new ad line will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete or select either the R@@ emo@@ ve button or select in the menu Edit selection . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example images can also be stored on your hard drive . of course you have to record the pictures somewhere , so you can record the images in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary photos can be loaded from the hard disk .
images in which the right upper hand is cut off , are not saved on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 there are the thumb@@ nails , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can not view these images with the image concerned .
as you can see this feature , you need to copy files from the folders and copy again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; support it until now , not you want to avoid the inser@@ ting of the relevant CD . if you would like to avoid any hass@@ les of your pictures , please purchase a larger drive to save all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you can use the pictures so that you can see for others in@@ accessible and click on Rec@@ re@@ viewing View inside the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures that can see your little sister , con@@ serve , and select the menu item everything except current view .
with this , you set up which images are hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing them to get locked out . if you want to see the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to set a password which must be entered into the un@@ lock of images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the menu Privacy Policy .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . for example , everyone can access the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml , to read the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; acoustic album ; not very familiar to do the view of private pictures .
the reason why you will spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours to describe you is of course that you want to look at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video visu@@ als . you can preview them from the preview , as described in described .
the viewer can see you in it . of course he shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter into the picture , such as who is in the image , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can easily drag and drop them somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether all of these options are displayed according to a right @-@ click on the viewer . you can see the right @-@ click menu click below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click on the browser , see the appropriate entries to this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and then use the buttons image high and image below . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features can also be reached from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as di@@ asch@@ au . then a new image loads it by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or Min@@ us press . started and stopped , the slides through the keys C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can click into the picture and pull out to zoom . with the mouse simply put a rectangle . with the min@@ us button you can slip again the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture will not be zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ alization key puts the zoom , so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image .
notice that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work with videos that work in and out with the Plus@@ - and the key .
with the filming from the context menu you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you &apos;ll find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can watch it off and open configuration dialog from the picture to copy this name . you &apos;ll perhaps prefer to highlight the picture and see further pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and select it as good or bad as you look at one by one .
for both examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to show pictures with characteristics while watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . in a look at a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have placed features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , then simply provide all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you want to view categories in D@@ re thumb@@ nail , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letters for the feature , after the picture was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image . for this case allows you to paint &amp; photo album ; in the picture to paint .
the painted will not be saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can make your painted later on .
you can see an image on the painted tree . in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; just turn on the image from the context menu . to finish the mast , you simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must not control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray you should have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following listing menu ends , so that you can choose the right position :
with Del@@ ete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can select previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changing properties , click on to apply these changes . do you have invalid values , a message with a fault description will be displayed . then you can use the input de@@ cker right again and then click on to apply changes to dis@@ rup@@ ting .
if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation in the interior dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation .
if you edit an texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the peculi@@ arity view .
press Preview in the peculi@@ arity view and a small example of the scene will have been selected using the chosen texture , even if you want a subordin@@ ate element . if you want just one part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross them locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a lens @-@ level . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects will only then be shown when they are selected or their visualization level smaller or equal in the toolbar of the sequence .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window @-@ order as a default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the default window procedure or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them to any number . you can also save several shut@@ ters and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the start to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the start to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you want to relate multiple opinions to each other , you prefer the starting point in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cart@@ oons @-@ page into the views .
the last possible window @-@ order are ho@@ ist views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view out of anch@@ oring , drag the start to the desktop or click on the little left at the top left arrow in the toolbar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the toolbar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for each type of views . new views are sound@@ ing , you can anchor them on any place .
the current window view can save you with window shut@@ ters ... save it . a dialog displays that you can store the window @-@ order under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ame the current scene click on the icon Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the toolbar or select the menu sequence .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to set a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender settings in the toolbar or menu view R@@ ender modes ... choose the following dialog will be opened :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that allows the properties of the mode .
in the card card size you can enter the width and height of the straight image . if you want just a small area of the image , select the cross @-@ box sub@@ section and enter the image @-@ section for ren@@ ders into the input fields .
in a combination field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for rendering it from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender @-@ properties can be found in the user Guide &amp; Pov@@ ray .
if a picture is rounded with just one ray per pixels you can create various mistakes . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è sample or stu@@ d effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is adapted again and adap@@ tive because every pixel depends on again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ ring depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray goes a ray per pixel . if you adjust the difference between the shades of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth to 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 added points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ B 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between dy@@ es the pre@@ defined threshold , then the pixels being divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that are individually followed and checked for further classification . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the lowering .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the production of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn off J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to charge a scene with this property .
on this map card , you can adjust if the alpha channel is to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . an pixels is then transparent when the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray . if &amp; Pov@@ ray opens , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if at Im@@ porting messages or warnings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ k@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ end .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor , simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ tion into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is called a scene . usually this Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on help in the Cre@@ denti@@ als View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation shown here . set the path to your documentation and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , al@@ ph@@ ur ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you involve files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type identi@@ fier .
you can adjust the object @-@ catch of the points on the grid menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values arise an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed level for two directions .
when you cross the detailed instructions for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire model views are further divided , if the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projection . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you can@@ did a wall , a wall is depicted behind the objects . the wall is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross soil will cross the ground below the objects . the ground is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you activate cant@@ at@@ ebo@@ at , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling value can be set . precise information about the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
this page allows you to change existing shut@@ ters or create new window assignments . in the window assignments will be explained as you can create window assignments and save it .
the Com@@ bin@@ ational field standard window image : displays all existing window assignments . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used the selected window @-@ order when starting the program .
the list of available shut@@ ters shows all existing window assignments . a new arrangement can be set up with the button Add and delete a selected order using the button R@@ emo@@ ve .
each window of window is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all views for the chosen window assignment . new views can be set with the button Add and delete selected views with the button R@@ emo@@ ve .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with oun@@ ces anchor the window below the existing window , with card card , you get a card card view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not adjust the camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark , and you only get a black picture .
if you have everything error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , following the following window assemblies :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow these instructions , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular , note that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera . if they click on it , you see the content of the viewing properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray you will find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera is in view of control points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click on a check point and drag it to the desired location .
if you apply the button or press Enter , the wire model views and the object @-@ tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an enclosed method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : actually offers an easier way . you can use an infinite level as the ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or paste the button . in the object @-@ tree the new name will be shown immediately .
the wire model view also shows the level as well as at the moment only as a limited time frame . if you turn the scene , the plane stretched out to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can click on the icon on the ground . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should post@@ p@@ one the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , so that you can get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and set the values as follows :
just choose the floor to stop its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog will open in which you can choose to be inserted in the object . you can change the name in the object @-@ tree ( name = bottom pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material because you need settings for pig@@ ments yet . therefore , keep in mind that you can review the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way now .
if you don &apos;t want to preview color on Qu@@ ader and Ball , just click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is right now . if you put your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you have to do . here are other settings necessary . in the color list you have to insert two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose in the object @-@ tree every@@ es@@ mal and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you already be able to run , since you have understood the fundamental working methods of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : the ball can just be as simple as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the button paste or the button to press ) so the ball has float over the floor as you have moved the floor to a unit down .
of course , the rendering results now a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step an appropriate material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the ground , you give the ball a pigment as a colour :
select First sub @-@ object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ments . click Ball pigment , select then select and set the values as follows :
but you can reach more exciting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screenshots and click to apply or press Enter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection sur@@ rendered some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what opportunities you &amp; G@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ transformer is an R@@ ender method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you find a scene ray@@ trac@@ en , the rendering of hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( i.e. from the camera , which the scenes are reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects are reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects . thus , the scene pixels for pixels were processed .
as you can imagine , you will see without a camera nothing , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously needs any scene that should be hin@@ dered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already have saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . it is a new file , you have to enter a name and space .
displays the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are rejected .
this menu entry you can only select if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
to the most recently und@@ o @-@ made command . this menu entry can only then select if you have used machining .
saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands to this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove the tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler .
a B@@ ump map is a way to customize the surface surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from do@@ zens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then passed on to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ k@@ show ; is a comfortable image @-@ image and a browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; spher@@ ical show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can enter with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return return can be displayed .
you can adjust if every image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a particular file , simply type the first signs of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a suitable fil@@ ename has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog , there are five card cards . in three of them , gener@@ ously and editing and slideshow , you can set up the working method of &amp; spher@@ ical show ; set in the two other , short command for the scor@@ eboard and short command for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut for each window can be set .
if this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can set down . default mode is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; balls show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
this option saves &amp; cud@@ d@@ show ; when you opened the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; cud@@ d@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to choose a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is larger than the image , is also filled here in the background with the selected color .
you can create &amp; spher@@ ical show ; thus set up that only some of the file types can be shown that the program can also be displayed .
with this option for large images the display ster is enlarged on the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
sets out if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the interval between the change of image at a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; spher@@ ical show ; in the card cards short command for the scor@@ eboard and short command for the browser .
with this option you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window around .
displays large icons for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons to the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
res@@ ized the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
enlarged the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ k@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened more .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ ename you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; KDE , image processing based on the &amp; scan ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ously ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to preview your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; KDE ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on that the user contributes to his part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ foto ; makes it as easy as possible errors or potential improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides a page with a link . if you use it , your browser opens a page for reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo . if you have a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo . if you have a more common user of &amp; show@@ photo . please click here to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , you will have spoken English only , you should be so powerful in this language .
the best start to get involved in the show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer Mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you have to choose the behavior of the show@@ photo . set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the icons to the left .
in the range of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . de@@ mean@@ ings should display the colors with what you are to show in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar on the right edge , which provides you important information and actions on the selected images . you can display this in which you click on one of the five tab :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning of images , which no longer makes it scan and p@@ adding more than images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning of images , which no more power as images to scan and p@@ adding . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save a dialog for storing or storing the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also show the pictures before store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can choose the scanner and click OK to open the scanner . cancel it . cancel it .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
to view a picture , the user can only start a preview can and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview is started by the Preview button .
to select the image better the user can zoom into the image and out of the current selection out to zoom . it can also set the zoom so that the complete Preview will fit into the window .
when the image was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if on the storing a preview is selected in the settings then the image will be displayed in a showcase , as shown below is shown . when storing is pushed , then the image will be saved and bra@@ lie ? s leads to a break and you get back to the main window .
the button settings will be opened by the button settings in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the image if desired , prior to the storing . in this case , the option will be selected before storing a preview file . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way for storing any picture . dialog to choose for each image opens the dialog prior to any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite open it automatically with an generated name in a previously defined folder , then you will need to choose storing without a fil@@ ename .
this setting defines where the images can be saved in the option saving without a fil@@ ename . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for dialogue to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change it using the button .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically storage images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically stored image will be numbered with a numerical suff@@ ix of each es@@ time when a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can customize the image quality for saving plug @-@ quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button aid starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the KDE About @-@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ ill@@ ite .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GPL and use the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , under L@@ GPL . warning : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GPL with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs short@@ cuts . below you will set up a list of this cuts and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and configure glob@@ als . -@@ specific keyboard short@@ cuts , you can set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and choose short@@ command ... select .
you may need to set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; therefore make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface from Amar@@ o@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts .
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of missing dependency . please check your script whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user does not know why a script does not work .
begin does &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the base for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP you can replace your scripts with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the simplest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each KDE installation should be attached .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . this is usually called Ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy to be called . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts will constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script should ignore the events even if there is no use of it .
configure indicates the script to display the layout dialog . to store the storing and loading of the furniture data , each script should decide itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is to be played . the script may now ask for example ; with D@@ COP functions further information to the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an integer from 0 to 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ ver@@ itable men@@ tions , contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can also be identified . to remove the menu a separate entry , one can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ Script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ize ( sub@@ menu @-@ titles ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it stops , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example . such as the storing of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks Script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .t@@ ar ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) which allows the user to recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ ok script .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the expan@@ se of amar@@ ine script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages immediately .
the main critic has to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to be char@@ geable modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s right :
if your script is finished , you can go up on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; hang . for your entry on KDE apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ ; Skri@@ ll use .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; KDE ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily pull music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very particular title made of thousands of thousands within your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; Colle@@ ct Browser and the Quick Search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart playlist automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gener@@ ic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ o@@ ist is intelligent , sexy and fancy - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
usually , you have to enter the fol@@ dable folder of Amar@@ o@@ ok sources to compile Amar@@ o@@ ok and install :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have to compile no difficulties . if you encounter any problems , please report them to the &amp; KDE ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has a number of options for most applications to enable or disable it for the comp@@ iling time frame with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compiler options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ates de@@ activated de@@ activated symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the interior dialog . the layout dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
player windows display the player window in addition to the playlist , or out . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists @-@ window will be attached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ah , compiled with support for mo@@ o@@ dy bar . the option turns the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tuning : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . thus , the colour scheme is modified for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
voting files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ cer@@ ated . if this setting is activated , .@@ Ho@@ wever files are stored on the memory location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ CH files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; otherwise ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ / mo@@ o@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
playlist to save the playlist , store the current playlist automatically when using &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; enable this option when you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist at the end .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this attitude , is used &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use it . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
current piece of the piece @-@ change clearly causes that the play@@ lists windows open up / down , in order to keep the running piece always in the visible window area .
when change@@ over to the context @-@ browser , automatically changes the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screens .
Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have C@@ deli@@ bs therefore installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will function the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome is to work for example difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use C@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these represent an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can see the file being fin@@ ed by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / license _ scan@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the day Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the cap@@ ut@@ te file that has caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly , it is that Tag@@ lib si@@ ashes when reading the Meta info from this file . please report this bug to the day Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , please sample SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ah ; is a little mature .
make sure that all libraries are compiled by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if such as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3,@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then this leads to t@@ ating the meta @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate automatic . switch off if in@@ active for ... into the setting of the sound system , or do not at least use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the E @-@ Mail opens automatically with a crash ) and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 should write in the meta @-@ info , but not as Unicode . the Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; Die File $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags from $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random smo@@ dus / repetition / dynamic play@@ lists ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the toolbar can easily be forgotten . you can click on the check centre on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol until this attitude shows its effect .
if you get this mistake : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ available symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ C@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check whether Amar@@ o@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ o@@ app &apos;@@ _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok is the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems is easiest through the help of an expert to search for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ o@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if something is located at the rec@@ ti@@ fying of an error in Amar@@ o@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do music pieces come there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the finish intui@@ tively , the start @-@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the review by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist , the playlist version and select column show . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ ok is in the background .
select the files that you want to remove , and then press Enter on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select the playlist from the folding menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just like you would do it with other files as well .
in the toolbar of the playlist , directly next to adding button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably you are missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look even to lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ al@@ isations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you will find it via the menu bar under extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question are Which media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support you pretty much every conceivable audio format . g@@ stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG .
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be supplied in the default setting no MP3 deco@@ ders ( out of pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 KDE , Rhin@@ ab@@ et@@ aste
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; Play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ sta@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be reached by a sound@@ card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mix@@ er ) . take a look at the help of D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem and help a solution . for g@@ ots you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( eg . os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does not work &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a dé@@ c@@ or with little over@@ head . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend right to AL@@ SA , as well as x@@ ins .
use either the G@@ sta@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with maximum possible priority ( real @-@ time ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the wr@@ wr@@ ap@@ pers are su@@ id :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause serious playback . read this error report . the enlar@@ ging of the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA @-@ furnishings file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install KDE @-@ multimedia completely to get the faster Arts @-@ co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ins driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less agreements react the visu@@ al@@ isations . yes , that &apos;s an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . run G@@ ST regi@@ sters to register all G@@ sta@@ amer components .
read the G@@ spre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C Channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ o@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg down , compile and install it . then perform in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you can find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
please report on it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of proposals / li@@ king , send them the best to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ ck@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . moreover , the name contains the magical K ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP is the already possible . set in your calendar program an alarm and run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; the playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have awakened by the gentle tones of music that you have stopped before bed .
how to find out the current date in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; current titles if one is on a different computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . Diesel command gives you interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ I ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ used --@@ user ih@@ re@@ used : Amar@@ o@@ player nov@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; window . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size alter@@ able window .
the combination of Str@@ g + rights mouse button makes a piece in the chin @-@ sequence in queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search returned .
OK , the Player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control panel ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS @-@ drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ o@@ ok to a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
place the CD a , then click on the menu on Audio CD . you will open a file browser with multiple folders . to normal read , choose a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take instead files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has every single review on the overall result .
you can enter the review for one piece by clicking on a column version in the playlist window . you can also select the valu@@ ation of a piece by clicking on a single playlist , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and edit : review or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the valu@@ ation in the dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want to announce that when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ ok . this means KDE @-@ packages have a fixed publishing plan that is not related to the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can easily find annoying . disable the option icon playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar and take the desired changes .
download a design , or create an own . install this on Amar@@ o@@ ok ... Image context @-@ browser design , click new design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) was too similar . to avoid difficulty , it was removed .

audio cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces can be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and a password . audio cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of bott@@ ling and thus also causes a lot of errors .
probably got &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ins or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine will not compile this output module . you need to configure and install Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new configuration and install .
well , I have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output files still does not appear . and now ?
probably you will use a distribution which is installed the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the necessary developer files are installed . after that you need to install x@@ ins @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile x@@ ins @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install it .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with p@@ rel@@ ic , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ ay . a tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : uses not LD@@ FLA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can the second sound card be used with Amar@@ o@@ ok ?
under Settings Amar@@ o@@ v up ... Audio release enter the device . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intellectu@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ js h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
type in the interior dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB @-@ sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of scanning str@@ ates , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , tick the tick on sound@@ card supported m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio @-@ output with Arts will not continue . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed tut@@ or for Arts : )
music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the furniture assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like to update your collection , or the wizard simply do not like , then this Quick start instruction will be a help . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in a few minutes .

the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the run text , you can also use the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or de@@ activated the play@@ lists window , while the button E@@ Q is used for setup E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ posi@@ tional sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to stop the piece position or the volume . with the playback buttons , you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio tracks . there are 17 preference , from Classi@@ cal to Techn@@ o , and you can easily create own preference .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer you can use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q in the player window . once you mark the An@@ go@@ z@@ feld E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is the most advanced play@@ lists of all for &amp; KDE ; available multimedia player . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player . but let yourself be deter@@ red by the abundance of features they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users power strong enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub@@ windows are later still lower in detail . they provide information on the ongoing piece on each different aspects .
if you already have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you might be noticed that the sub@@ window will start off . the information presented here are now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok . moreover , the information in the Statisti@@ cal window may be collected ( extras statistics ) .
the sub @-@ window music displays information about the current piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first section in this window shows information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to follow the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
see the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find more information about the current piece . you see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view covers @-@ images in the context @-@ browser , the Cover images must be displayed in the same folder as the current piece . the file form@@ ate .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ n@@ g are supported . the context browser will also show cover pictures that have been downloaded with the Cover administration or are embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces they are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set the information displayed in the music window , click with the right mouse button somewhere in the bottom window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the interpreter , lists all albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be up , and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to immediately start playing . you can also click with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text files written by yourself . once you click on the text box , try &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which should be started .
the button edit allows you to edit the Li@@ ed@@ text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; s collection database . this is no running text script needed .
the button Find a search on google.com after the Li@@ ed@@ text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are left out apart .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces will be arranged according to interpreter and below , a further distribution is done after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpreter .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown to one album , the standard 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will first appear to genre and including the performer .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t / album - This setting works just like the above , but is also sorted according to the album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing quite gradually and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will change your collection automatically as soon as you have something to change the selected folders . if you own lots of pieces , this could take a while .
directly below the toolbar there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view , as well as in construction @-@ view . indications for using this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this hand@@ book .
under the search filters there is a selection box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose different tim@@ est@@ amps , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . of course , you can naturally also select your total collection , whereby the filter is practically off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
loading - This le@@ aning the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order into the playback .
hang on play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces in queue . thus , you will play next .
save as a playlist ... - saves the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces in queue for transmission on the Media Player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / Go to CD - Dad@@ dies are sent the selected pieces on K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data - or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
metadata ( for n pieces ) edit ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation mark - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
highlight mark@@ up - changes as a compilation marked album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer appear under different interpre@@ ters but again under the given interpre@@ ters .
the play@@ lists of the play@@ lists is easy to use with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ lig@@ ently play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; s built @-@ in database to create some useful play@@ lists to run time automatically . the intelligent play@@ lists are made up of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played before .
even self @-@ created Intel@@ lig@@ ently play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ lig@@ ently playlist to open the dialog to create a new intellectual playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub @-@ window Media Player is used for connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) , it must be mounted before the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper list of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and drop it on the list interpreter . if you are finished , click on the list . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . when the transmission is completed , you finish &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; and solve the balance connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area that you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the bottom part of the browser &apos;s browser is a address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . if you press for example tar / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ endi@@ ces of files by simple case can be difficult . in that case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : thus , falling files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouth .
the playlist comp@@ iles all of you to play with the mouse . you can enter the order by typ@@ ing the items simply by using the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces will contain . to reset the filter , press so long the back@@ down until the text field is empty again .
if you enter into separate searches through spaces , will be included &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; after orders , which contain all search terms . if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries , one , two and three included .
if you enter between the search terms , will search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you would like to search for entries , the spaces are included , then close the search term with da@@ isi@@ es : Mike Old@@ field . thus , I search for entries related to Mike Old@@ field , but not for contracts like e.g. Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you give a certain search @-@ old , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for pieces , which have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for one piece , which does not contain a specific search term , ask a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that does not contain .
you can combine these syn@@ taxes for popularity . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment .
you can set the playback sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are reproduced .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you will find the button Add that you can add the playlist pieces . to the right next , you will find play@@ lists , playlist and be payable M@@ alian .
next follow the buttons and restore . this allows you to make changes to the playlist or recover .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , bigger analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ ch@@ rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar button is menu . it opens the same menu as that you &apos;ll see in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ly ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many other available buttons for the toolbar icons , for example ren@@ e@@ checks and volume control . you can set the visu@@ als buttons by clicking on menu and set up toolbar icons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of useful information on the play@@ lists . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play of the current piece . moreover , the status for random smo@@ dus and res@@ or@@ ting can be easily changed by clicking the mouse double in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar as well . disable the option status bar in the general settings .
the context menu can be reached by a click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on menu . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plugins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
behind this entry a sub@@ menu with link@@ ups to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover administration is a useful resource for managing your cover images . you can launch them by selecting the Cover Cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to be displayed in the Cover administration . select from :
the queue administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist , appears in the playlist one number next to the title . this number represents the order , in the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as a second , and so on .
the administration of the queue will open you with the queu@@ es . if you want to add a piece in the playlist , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists from which two are already given ( the details to set up these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during the reproduction .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a load profile to this dynamic playlist .
click on the desired playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select the new playlist by the new one . you should save the old play@@ lists so under circumstances ! with the
the two pre@@ defined modes of random mix and play@@ lists filling instantly your playlist and you can add the playback directly . the suggested pieces will start at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added in the next item , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the button Neu fill the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . playlist opens up the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog will open for editing the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the settings for coming pieces will be over@@ thrown , and they will be in this playlist no piece twice . if the attitude is active , the songs are already split , taking note of the setup play .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the play@@ lists . thus , you can easily see which pieces have recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to each play@@ ed piece for play@@ lists . if you adjust here more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece is played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , will add multiple play@@ lists ; random pieces from each of the listed play@@ lists .
some scripts allow own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts can be installed by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry is displayed on the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . just use the button more scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select this to delete script then click D@@ un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please see the section writing scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ aliz@@ ations is used to enable the available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ; used . the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the cross @-@ box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps an audio CD will be created , you must have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other over@@ lu@@ sion@@ ed formats , you think that you &apos;re getting to MP3 a worse quality , no matter how much the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . use the project au@@ c@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to complete the steps you need to have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; have the Qu@@ ell CD included in the CD @-@ Rom .
to copy a data CD , please select extras , CD copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burn .
once you have done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the button Start . you now see a dialog with that or something like this :
in this dialog window you can track the progress of the copy process . once the reading of the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to which the data should be burned .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T designer tool U@@ IC can not find the &amp; KDE ; wid@@ get modules not find . to fix this problem you q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plugins to the search engine for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your basic folder of &amp; KDE ; ) .
the website of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will get feedback on the latest version of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; in addition , you can get feedback on shared assistance from forums and news .
if you want to use &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; KDE ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ k@@ iso@@ fs : does all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions , which also offers &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; used automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . the Internet is commonly referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a perfectly open , pat@@ ent@@ free and professional technology for audio @-@ encoding and for dealing with audio data stream . O@@ GG Pre@@ to benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ der@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio Dek@@ art . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( such as MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a far @-@ developed MP3 Decoder that can compete with commercial enco@@ ders in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code de@@ c for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio @-@ en@@ coder module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to be followed on an audio CD .
so@@ x : an auxiliary program that can go between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video management . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the functionality fully equipped car @-@ system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to match the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example to create a bl@@ ender CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different top @-@ level of the different albums may lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the tunes can be reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
saves the current project . once the project has already been stored , the previously uploaded file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ ename .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ ename . KDE &apos;s dialogue Save as is displayed under which you can choose folder and fil@@ ename for the project file .
saves all opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call for any single project file saved .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and has not yet been saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what shall happen . you can then choose between save and changes . besides , you can shut down the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will inqu@@ ire for each not stored project , which is to happen , as if you were called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each no@@ stored project will be asked what it should happen , as if you were called the file .
if you access this entry , you can choose the dialog files for adding a project . that &apos;s the same effect when you view the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics dialogue of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to burning the medium . the distill@@ ery can only be opened when the project is already data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is this ? aid described ( accessible using the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you &apos;re involved in a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you &apos;re not used for a multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you to see if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files already available on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function is not removed from the medium , it bl@@ ends just the previously imported files again .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . alternatively , you can also create an image from a CD onto another medium . alternatively , you can also use only one image from a CD which then eventually can burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of running instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . alternatively , you can also create an image of a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can also use only one image of a DVD instead of normal copy , so the target can be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data from source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ R@@ W . this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD @-@ R@@ W .
opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the des@@ ks and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously prepared CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button . ( N@@ ero * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , you will need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously set DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously illuminated DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be all@@ ot@@ ted also used . it contains information about the read video , body settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the available medium . this information is displayed in the table view and include characteristics of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is listed , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not inter@@ sect , the status bar is hidden .
enables the folder view , or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the table view is activated , its content is displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , locks and locking the disk or discharge of the medium .
enables the table view one or off . the table view allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the table view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the head@@ line in the proj@@ ec@@ ar view or off . the head bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that contains only visible when the project view open projects contains . the head@@ line has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the proj@@ ec@@ ar view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window to modify the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; once you have chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key order to it below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings assistance . thus , the correct entit@@ lements can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can use general Program@@ mes . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alise and for the fine tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is like many other &amp; KDE applications , also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality of the function , therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive , which the con@@ dens@@ ate programmes give you the default .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; features you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b will be started . then you enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; KDE ; programs reported , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts which are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ aus DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ re@@ cre@@ ate@@ aus DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ cre@@ dit@@ ch Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ cre@@ dit@@ ch Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ cre@@ dit@@ - Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ cre@@ dit@@ - Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ cre@@ dit@@ - Project ( ) di@@ form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) at bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d ( ) at bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ COP Re@@ reference to the newly generated project : # K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ o@@ d and then receive a reference to the project by means of # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference , it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable on data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
A@@ void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) , l@@ ymph@@ s ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) , blo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) , in ren@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) , mor@@ dial vol@@ ati@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
for example , it is possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then insert files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT C@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b cre@@ ate@@ urs d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ readable for &amp; KDE ; with it can be easily read audio @-@ CD ; s , and can be saved in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many codes ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( ver@@ lu@@ st@@ free compression ) will have to be installed from Linux distribution ) . further co@@ effici@@ ents can still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read ; read and compressed into WAV files on your computer ( un@@ loaded and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per titles ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also other formats such as loss @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the read the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . nearly every distribution has assembled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this has not yet been installed , this must now be done .
for the second step you need to be l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ie to ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ effici@@ ents . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distribu@@ tions . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which co@@ ding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word of copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; and this program is not intended to b@@ yp@@ ass the firmware of the CD ; / DVD tool protection , it is not possible to b@@ acc@@ use a protected audio CD ; Even in any case , it cannot avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid the purchase of Cop@@ per @-@ protected audio @-@ CD ; s !
while inser@@ ting only once must be done ( the furniture dialog can be called so often as far as a suitable configuration was found ) , after reading a &amp; CD . this results ( hopefully ) to understand the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on what encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can record &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB Explorer and can work completely without network , whereby everything is manually covered .
this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step there is more information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the installation of enquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case must first be made the connection to the Internet . )
start the read and - if a Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings in the Setup Wizard - encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder so that the selection can be read with any other en@@ coder as the standard . it is to be noted that previously the en@@ coder has been configured in the dialog settings in the dialog dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already illuminated file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the layout dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ages ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; closed ) .
opens the main entrance dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like en@@ coder , for setting the En@@ co@@ ders ) . so far , you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ar@@ er and compression rates and helps you with choosing the right co@@ p .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; Mon@@ &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats , you lose information through data comp@@ iling according to their psycho@@ audi@@ ble model , MP3 and O@@ GG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ zer produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most of the distribu@@ tions , but there are open license questions
+ high up very high quality quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deep bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo . today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters to audio quality and get out of the com@@ promised compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et media &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces accepted transparency and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo @-@ stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ B 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ ug for music of young people , portable devices and car access systems . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program automatically generated from the free@@ DB over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / sell with &amp; sound audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with coexistence programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders declare the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords , if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks so : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters used to be used ( = garlic @-@ drawing in the wizard ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database where people can download the audio CDs and enter the information , so that all the others can download this information rather than yourself into the calculator . it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the U@@ eber@@ ry : that &apos;s the author meant ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent that you are inf@@ lic@@ ted by the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so the information can be inf@@ lic@@ ted by the artist nor the music company . all the information can be obtained in a b@@ um@@ mel through a &amp; CD ; business , physically , or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; an active part to select ( send an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counterf@@ eit ) address when used in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address can not be used by the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code ) .
in many countries copies of the main database are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use free@@ DB shall be needed for the use of free@@ DB . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org offers a current list of mir@@ r@@ ored on the online call of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally created monthly ) only the actu@@ aliz@@ ations of the database .
which version is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used to know that it wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed at first if this is not yet done .
to save time @-@ read WAV files , the code can be selected and thus selected the desired file format . at first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the code . other co@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the code can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined encoding . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a code you can get more information about his switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ ation window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and read@@ just on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio @-@ enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the boun@@ cing of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood but are somehow still uns@@ ure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , read everything and start our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to produce MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keywords .
there have to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine as it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can of course always do .
please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have scre@@ aming it ( eg by trying to copy something into the con@@ quer@@ or something ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably only once done and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we determine the cutting enco@@ ders for the compression of music ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . when we are lazy , we split the program to use the free@@ DB program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it with any read of a &amp; CD ; change when the appropriate settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the video program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD Drive is available , it can also help the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries available there for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card card General Settings . here gi@@ b@@ ts do not have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything becomes as loaded / typ@@ ed as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only in case of complete information can be found so that you will be informed if details are missing for the witnesses of keywords ( tags ) .
the card @-@ card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD to download data automatically via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected during the read of the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD included is made immediately , when you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ ename or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory / fil@@ ename is changed with con@@ quer@@ or &gt; fil@@ ename , and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; KDE ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example is further to note : if you want to manually insert everything manually . however , this over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider it twice if this is profitable . to use free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode will be set up on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is for us of free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server via the Internet . how do the system knows which data is to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . do everything in the scre@@ enshot now .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as first attempt .
both function regul@@ ates what affects the server , because there are many fire@@ walls record the protocol ( 8@@ 80 default ) , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; Protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to submit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be de@@ activating .
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parall@@ eled reading and encoding ? the author knows it not , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , let this be dis@@ missed to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : when you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored . this box is not listed , the files in the private folder are created . do not forget to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
all as if it is on the scre@@ enshot now . the command is a bit long , under certain conditions , something must be kept to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo @-@ stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the generation of tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ st . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; KDE ; in case of a later change of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files at once : when dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can try to code more than a WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for any read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
in this section is described , such as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will need to be described in this section , has to be repeated for every expres@@ sive &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the screens are a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully removed from free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually insert it out of the internet . comments are indicated to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this hand@@ book .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD must now be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just like the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully met by the free@@ DB , all the titles are already completed and the name of the artist and album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window spl@@ ends , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best for your &amp; CD .
if you do not have a tick @-@ box for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but you need to get data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Re@@ ading title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must not be typ@@ ed in the input field &apos; Re@@ ading title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ ets per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of data from the free@@ DB is the CD @-@ editor not empty , but it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor , so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with big letters are beginning or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this is limited the length of the fields below 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 @-@ tags , you have set an unlimited field @-@ length , at least on what &apos;s &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set in the Settings menu , just take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the Ko@@ di@@ erer in order to obtain more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously subject to the style of the uploaded CD ; in this example , this is not important , as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway does not submit . for further information go to the Internet page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you entered all the front data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the item list .
note that there is a check character before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked are read . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all the pieces are selected , or if you select the button All pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection out of the read @-@ reading process , so this window appears to confirm the confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what proceeds .
click on the tab orders to turn off on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read straight to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will look you when you &apos;re trying to work with an enco@@ ders that you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and target folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have typ@@ ed writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . so you can read and code parallel . notice the status registration at the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration default to re@@ press this behavior . the only one that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . at low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous interpre@@ ting and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the final title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the cooking . after the last piece co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window will end .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you need &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the codi@@ les of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used today within the &amp; KDE ; CV@@ S as part of the we@@ aving media package . however , most distribu@@ tions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; KDE ; package is included . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is directed to individuals which compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for assistance as the program can be adjusted to your needs when it runs , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls forth many different programs , has many variations of settings . best you can read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of different card cards of settings and also includes comments for options that can not be used in example .
hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu has been clicked on for the first time of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this kind of empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program do not go audio @-@ CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual brief menu ?
what is it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; you can do it . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has described this section and is therefore with this proposal .
strange , if you succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; KDE to SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information but ...
&amp; col@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ er of &amp; KDE ; in addition to others he has not having real @-@ time @-@ consuming and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some characteristics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; KDE ; support . &amp; col@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ as@@ sic project driver that is needed for the CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequence .
&amp; col@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting of the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can enter into &amp; KDE , any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window on the Mid set .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( songs events or text events ) . K@@ Mid determines automatically the used procedure .
session support . if you end &amp; KDE ; during the playback of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI @-@ syn@@ thesizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS maps ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you choose the song you want .
you can also let a file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and enter the button finish in the toolbar , select the entry play from the menu item or enter the spac@@ eb@@ ar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , it will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song becomes too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the temp@@ o display and thus change the playback speed . to restore the original speed , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the spac@@ eb@@ ar has two tasks : when a piece is played , pressure on the spac@@ eb@@ ar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , so inter@@ rup@@ ts the reproduction . enter the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no piece is played , starts &amp; col@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again others . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; col@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically identified that you need to manually set a song , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set it manually . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set a sequence type , select from the menu settings the entries of textile events or song events . the same function also includes keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these will be played in line . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to insert a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click there to New and give the name to the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs in the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the sli@@ pped in the collection manager .
in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to no other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection will not be stored . concern yourself when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the button Add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with which help you choose the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is activated , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
when the Autom@@ atically Add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Del@@ ete .
you can select the order in which the songs are played off . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu playback of the menu collections , the songs are play@@ ed in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list above the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump to a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the button left .
to delete a collection , open the Colle@@ ctor Manager , select there the delete collection and click on the delete button .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is not saved by leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ map general @-@ MIDI events in events that understands syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that turns all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of Type Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et and thus always lets a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , do not need any MIDI map , because all sound@@ cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl. A@@ we - and CIS maps , FM radio devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ map is a text @-@ file that stores all necessary transformations for playing a piece of piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section , which may appear as often as desired . for this , however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP , A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard will be shown . the general usage looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the simultane@@ ity is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional Al@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to place all sounds that support this instrument ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . to do this in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun signal ) , it takes place 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch , where every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , Marac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) , and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section the sequence of lines is very important , as well as the presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can use multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used primarily to form t@@ ints to the Persian channel . take a look at the included Key@@ maps .
this section may be used to de@@ duce some channels to other . if you want to switch for example the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ Devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built following the following patterns :
n is the channel which is pic@@ tured on the Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined in the file name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all the events are ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case then always Patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ ky patch on the Per@@ k@@ rolling channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ naming ratio is given in which the ratio of pitch @-@ ben@@ der events is multiplied by the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ imal numbers ) .
this setting is needed , because GM indicates that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find the right value on your keyboard , you need a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole row of pi@@ vi@@ als ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ v@@ atures , you see which t@@ ints can be played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , lights the button no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to display the played tones . view in the menu settings under the point edge view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played off . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow@@ down it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file on two different devices can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can comp@@ el anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , whereas a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression mode of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; have happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s Start@@ ing )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add any files individually .
to do so , supports &amp; col@@ mid ; drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
in advance , enable the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection . otherwise the files are added to a temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD in order to slow down the reproduction . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD @-@ double .
I have been playing on a &amp; KDE ; desktop area a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folders and &amp; col@@ mid ; on this work@@ space ( if I want to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) or put it on this work@@ space ( if I want to play a kar@@ ao@@ ke file ) or I want to play a file , only entered the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window switch and drag the file into the window by &amp; col@@ mid ;
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding directly to a collection , turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose that you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d . first , you just want to play the first file . so , set up the setting automatically to the collection and opening A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then un@@ lock yourself to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . all thank you ! if I can hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , further to &amp; col@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; col@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez . I &apos;m written in the third year , so I &apos;m not a lot of free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take me a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files , make music and prove them .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files when you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ c@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ aci@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home town or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , if you want to send me a MIDI file , but if you want to contact me , as I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and don &apos;t get back to anyone for that money . I therefore want to stress that I will only be more programmable , because / if I come back feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. sta@@ ler - rec@@ alling of the bug that the pitch was too high at A@@ we @-@ cards .
my thanks also goes Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the testing of the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for the testing of the A@@ we support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pe@@ pper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ulrich Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , a fault @-@ informed or just a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course , my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the net , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; col@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ Thr@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also look at links to sites with other kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an A@@ we card .
if you don &apos;t have sound card , you must compile &amp; col@@ mid ; with the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , as if you had a sound@@ card , except that you can of course hear any music .
if trouble occur , contact one of the &amp; KDE , mailing lists or send a message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files uploaded by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; KDE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The KDE Website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; KDE ; user mailing list .
the application window is made from the so @-@ called windows . there is always the window with the central view . either , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that will only appear when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to merge the preferred links under the book@@ mark book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which can be played after each other , so you should use the category Dau@@ phin playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you have a listing , his group and all of its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the raised entry .
the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , television and durability , can also be done by direct editing of XML configuration files . of course , one can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by application itself . just click on a name of a category cli@@ cks on it from the menu View and the next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to be chosen from the menu same with play@@ lists and select either the processing mode , or selected a different category .
all changes will be lost if the machining mode left or another group is selected without the playlist .
following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during start@@ up and filling can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ bl@@ c and Chang@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml are observed . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at start@@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the adver@@ ts of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; and lt ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ quired &quot; sr@@ c = / lt ; / body@@ work ; ye@@ a ; / body@@ work ; ye@@ a ; / body@@ work ; ye@@ a ; / body@@ work ; ye@@ a ; / body@@ work ; ye@@ a ; / body@@ work ; ye@@ a ; / body@@ work ; ye@@ a , are included in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a tab for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ own in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ bl@@ c . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
thus the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be re@@ done in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player , module needs to be specified as a service provider for the MI@@ ME type / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishings dialog by KDE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library . if no errors occur , the back@@ end issue is available inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so doing a given back@@ end for a certain MI@@ ME type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ bl@@ c . for example , phon@@ em@@ can describe all the og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can playback of TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ b@@ player ) . before TV can be stored , the scanner must be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually edited .
to Con@@ figur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Re@@ order ) Settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog to use in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there , ports can be found out of which a co@@ ding must be found ( e.g. : PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it .
since the V@@ DR is supported by k@@ m@@ player only X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only working method ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension needs to be functional for the X server . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server needs to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources various names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ d source , ex@@ it@@ es@@ our@@ ce , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ es@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the playback of the playlist .
will there be indications of how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not of the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is available as a user root after connecting the device . thereby , it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine only starts slowly , why each time my CPU has to be tested on its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ pick . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player takes automatically the last saved value , only the first time is x@@ ins check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional scroll application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be attributed to the package &amp; tex@@ tured ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution applications . for installation the documentation of distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be applied .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; this project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distribu@@ tions , allowing a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are listed on the ki@@ le .
this hand@@ book is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; KDE ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users probably need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are considered . however , the support for this project or its documentation is required , should be made in contact with the ki@@ le ; this website should be made .
if you have any questions or if you are looking at the comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list box @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; KDE ; -@@ work@@ space . also , offers the possibility for using all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . furthermore , the possibility of use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . furthermore , the possibility for a complete , comp@@ iling and fault tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities to experience the manual is to be attracted by K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .

just like other sig@@ nat@@ ories involves &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the gener@@ alization properties like paper format , page number@@ ing and text colors will be specified with the text . the introduction starts at least the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ ment } which starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ &apos; { document } .
the fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a clear feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the assistant ( men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . you can also place some options on the document related settings .

new users do not have to worry about . it is a brief description of the functions and further information on this subject are given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; if any mathematical environment is not closed . you hate it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you by the high@@ lighting time and self @-@ saving .
with the automatic understanding of the environments is created by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ &apos; command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the app@@ liance command ( e.g. \ \ \ . command } ) . this function can be activated in the men@@ Ã ¼ settings ; establish ... La@@ Te@@ X commands de@@ activated .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; educate the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most part and sub@@ du@@ des the lowest element ) :
when viewing the document in the struc@@ turing , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse @-@ click of the respective document .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; if a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; framed file &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the final output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools for viewing , conversion and print of DVI ; files for different systems and upri@@ ghts .
when using the text search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file associated with the editor will be clicked , is the exact opposite of it . once you have clicked on a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is clicked , becomes the corresponding point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other collabor@@ .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master document is set to set project preferences .
rapid super@@ structure : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( if no errors in the source code are available ) .
file level : in this mode , the DVI ; file on Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ unt@@ â t made possible , and there is no call for &amp; oc@@ ular ; after the rapid super@@ structure .
in contempl@@ ating the machining process , the three large numbers of components should be taken into the document . the first choice field has been developed for the rapid breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Fur@@ ther is to the introduction of articles such as keywords , joints , or references . the optional features are :
name : with this command a description for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
cover : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection of a selection box ) .
when passing from quote will be displayed a list of literary entries . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; and the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written naturally also in &amp; ki@@ le ; from hand to be written .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ³ Al@@ e is used for determining the fonts . it can be set for the main text , the fox , etc . , there are the following ty@@ pe@@ ways :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices for setting : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of documents and st@@ acking the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand on hand .
the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ &apos; Docum@@ entary class contain the settings for the command . the writing &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays the ty@@ po@@ tions . will not be set at the beginning , this can also happen also in the text .
once the above source code example has to be entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the men@@ Ã ¼ s or the Kno@@ pf@@ s power@@ building .
the source code must be saved in front of the compiler . &amp; ki@@ le ; to store the storage automatically .
you are missing the comp@@ iling of the document , should be sought automatically in the logging of errors . when using fast construction , &amp; oc@@ ular devices should be started . this is not the case , the logging should also be observed .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the writing will have been created . the command \ \ &apos; { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ &apos; { environment } can be taken into the environment . ( English . HU@@ GE ) .
the amount will only be supervised within the area ( from \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) . there are no signs for transport within an environment .
there are many possibilities to protect the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it enables you to set certain ty@@ po@@ stage , fats , cou@@ ps , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either using the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the short print pressure and is long as long until he is closed with a \ \ &apos; { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be noted with \ \ emp@@ h { words } .
\ \ &apos; rate : made a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; { rate } and ends with \ \ \ &apos; rate } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Out@@ line language was represented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ;
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . to this , there should be a quotation , some places in the li@@ pos@@ - and short @-@ term pressure and a poem for the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , using editor @-@ view or Str@@ g E can return to the editor ( when internal observer ) . with an external observer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and receive fun .
DVI ; is a small file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ve ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi output , as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer imaging .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . by clicking DVI - then the document can be printed by file Dru@@ cken ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set properly ) .
the toolbar buttons created the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code has been created , the conversion can begin into curved other formats using the mouse buttons in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ finding is the direct jump from the editor to an associated position inside the DVI ; -@@ file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . to this end , only modern settings must set up with settings ki@@ le ... tools build up .
to move the precau@@ tionary solution , the mouse @-@ cursor is positioned in a line of the source code and be clicked upon request . the jump to the appropriate point in the DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place so then .
with this function in &amp; oc@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; taken by &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as Tex@@ ts@@ di@@ tor has to be set ( settings oc@@ ular up ... Editor )
should if the use of rapid super@@ structure of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer does not exist , an error may appear . should be a mistake , this is displayed in the log file or in the News@@ window in summary .
the log file is the fault of the error source in the source code . in the editor you can always view the error correction of the faults . the log file is always the line in which the error appears . to click the faul@@ ty line , must be clicked on the error in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
once the appropriate button is clicked on the toolbar , a window appears for the selection of the submission templates for the document .
in the selection of empty document , a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for fast creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
ugly users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be placed in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file available or a new file must be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template , new strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or drawing ) . these variables can set up in settings ki@@ le to set up basic settings .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ NS $ $ : this drawing chain is replaced by entering document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ &apos; Docum@@ entary &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ NS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and hence the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been accomplished :
when creating a new document then your own template can be selected rather than the default ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files created . will be searched for a simple way to create a template , should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described under described steps .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for appointments available directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; can be made out .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities to experience the manual is to be attracted by K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; instruction reference , which can be called the Men@@ Ã ¼ Help La@@ Te@@ X reference reference . it includes a detailed description almost all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use you can find as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ clicking with penet@@ rated C@@ trl key to w@@ ading the &amp; tex ; word means that in this way , by clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ &apos; by \ \ &apos; par \ \ &apos; by clicking \ \ &apos; by clicking \ \ &apos; .
when drag the text with the left mouse button , the text box will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated switching threshold you can choose parts of the source code in the editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibilities to browse the various types of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can choose the jumping mat brands . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . this is also highlighted the jump to te@@ h or the last jumping brand . this is also highlighted the jumping brand , so that it is automatically extracted in the first input of a character .
the Edi@@ ting is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already outstanding possibilities , were added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source code ; special orders for their selection . under Edit excer@@ pts are the following commands for the text selection are included :
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph does not contain a text of the same line ( as in other Tex@@ ts@@ dit@@ ors ) . this extended meaning do not include tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is it that the Ab@@ ove is separated by two blank lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also l@@ atex ; commands with an iron table ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to the spo@@ ilt of a part of the document it may be removed from that first and by making the button an@@ f . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ hole C@@ trl ; K with which the entire row is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands , the following commands may contain for loos@@ ening of the text :
remove a paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit in paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for other commands under Edi@@ ting surroundings , easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
with this command , to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to pick up the surroundings .
with this command leads to the end of the current setting ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to pick up the area .
if the cursor is in front or within the command \ \ begin { surroundings } , becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of sp@@ ach@@ ed ambient commands can quickly be lost the memory view . this command close the most recently reached environment , so that the conce@@ al@@ ted ambient structure is not destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups , which are determined by br@@ aces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match them from the machining environment .
this command will be pr@@ elo@@ aded to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the bracket cl@@ amp .
with this command the cursor is set to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the p@@ aced cl@@ amps .
if the cursor is before or behind the cur@@ ly cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of veil@@ ed groups @-@ br@@ aces can quickly be lost in the memory view . this command close the last modified group , so that the conce@@ aled structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not broken .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple application signs are used as a G@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ents . for the purpose of purpose the sign is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and dec@@ eption two in@@ stit@@ uting signs for l@@ l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double characters can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and sign@@ posted .
you can also use L@@ Ã ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( such as n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French characters . there are also many other languages available .
in the drink of Shift ; input boards . if the current position inside a lists -@@ environment ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment close &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ up balance .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to be supported on pres@@ et &amp; l@@ atex ; - or Custom @-@ defined environments . these can be placed under settings ki@@ le ; establish ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users m@@ apped the columns in tables - environments and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to emp@@ t this . if this sp@@ ulator is not the living , for the shut@@ down &amp; ki@@ le ; several inter@@ space for the columns position of the current t@@ ulator .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code recognition , this in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are still expanded . all of these modes can be set for different working methods of settings ki@@ le to set up ...
in the beginning a new environment by using the command \ \ begin { surroundings } becomes &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
upon the tip of the R@@ Ã ¼ inch the last letter is removed from input and allow the default list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be found even when selecting a command . alternatively , jumping cou@@ pons can be found , so that a simple jump to these positions by means of editing jumping mark@@ ers is suitable and the requested parameters can then be explored .
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; en@@ force@@ able settings to these lists are made . it enables you to choose different winding lists ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as winding of the general language used .
the command mode is intended for the understanding of environments not back . it always uses a few letters with \ \ begin typ@@ ed . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the understanding of the environments .
when calling the complete mode of Alt + Shift key + Shift key + Shift key is automatically executed and it appears \ \ &apos; { . afterwards the environment can be continued in the easiest way and will be terminated by the scope of the input key .
after this is accomplished , the surroundings will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a lists environment , is even a first \ \ item command .
under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; en@@ force@@ able settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the list of sub@@ sist@@ ence mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supporting user @-@ defined lists of supplements which are replaced immediately by athle@@ tic strings . the lists can be set up under settings ki@@ le . as an example of a reco@@ vering list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L entered and the word trans@@ verse the men@@ Ã ¼ inch mode , the letter L will be replaced by the character chain \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
gro@@ omed e W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ents are not helpful for automatic re@@ aliz@@ ations . however , it has been found that many hamlets can be written in a document more than once . so it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the trans@@ verse for everybody is already written .
this mode can set up in the men@@ Ã ¼ inch settings ...
the storing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder . mode is available for operation ( correspondence ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã § ook ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed as simple as possible . to view the foundations of the foundations to the graphics formats , the sections should be and observed .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for inspection and new orders of pages . will the PDF output file , thus enables the pages to be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools new and then can be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to be able to place the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ Ã ¼ s creating compos@@ ing , creating transformations and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for observer such as &amp; oc@@ ular ; or another transformation can be used by Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 3 the DVI ; 4 the DVI ; 4 file into a PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick@@ ening command , it is normally called an observer after the comp@@ iling . should not be used an in@@ hibited viewer , every time a new window will be opened .

often work on a project consisting of several persons in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; supports the disclosure of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project like both team heads as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can search itself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by seeking the team member from the list , and the button app@@ alling then expresses . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears , according to which you are : text .
nick@@ name and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and notes . see for further information on comments .
beside the overview of their team there is another advantage through the collection of the members of the team : it may be created an event for information to the team heads when something happens . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that may be executed when something is occurring in the project . an example would be a record of opening and closing the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone is backed by , or a script that is saved to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the recipients mentioned in the recipient list . the addressing may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i can be set up such ladder .
notes are special comments in the documents . you are different from normal comments through the following things :
to enter comments is simple . it can be chosen either the Note @-@ listing from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a comment field followed by a review text .
notes may be sent to a determin@@ ate member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is played a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Manager sub@@ project conduc@@ tors , and sub@@ project conduc@@ tors , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ name and roller names are independent of large or small @-@ writing , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and form@@ atting languages supported D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up by means of Settings Qu@@ anta . Th@@ er@@ Dialog extends over some pages that are dealt with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; regarding tags , including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
large / small @-@ write of tags : large / small @-@ writing of automatically added tags . normal Groß / Minor Release , the tags are as inserted as described in the day XML files .
big / small @-@ write of attributes : large / small @-@ handed of automatically added attributes . normal Groß / small @-@ f@@ use means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if requested , will be optional for tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , this immediately after the bed ; inserted .
not optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags except for simple tags .
starting @-@ up and shut @-@ day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding term is changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the appropriate co@@ ding during the inser@@ tion process .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s to detect different types of files . using the Standard rebuild the default ones can be recovered .
standard version co@@ ding : encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening open files ( where encoding of the file can be over@@ b@@ ted ) . this attitude here will be converted from the same into the proj@@ ector , if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . this attitude here will be spread from the same into the proj@@ ector , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup of backup : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; creates regular backup copies , so that with a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored by this backup . that &apos;s not the same as saving the file . even if not stored documents will be a backup regularly , according to the time issued .
the Preview and documentation can either be displayed in the Edi@@ tor@@ field or an own view ( or the documentation in a box leader ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the default back next start is useful when the user interface has come through adjustment of the MDI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on beliefs through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning feedback area serves the taxes of the possibility to turn the ad of warnings by means of an@@ ha@@ ken by no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the syn@@ cing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , to be adjusted in details .
in the field of mouse @-@ click on the struc@@ turing @-@ tree causes the following action it is possible to change by clicking the structural tree with the mouse buttons with the mouse buttons .
in the field of structural @-@ tree attitudes , the visibility of no@@ des can be opened automatically in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree when editing and how deep in changing the Stru@@ c@@ tural tree will be opened automatically . blank spaces are those empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no item has been found in the current document .
the area for the for@@ ging of abbreviations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded when editing them , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ use abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plugins are managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications of third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , most known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not on a standard place like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
input : this information will pass on the plug @-@ in when starting , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of current file ) or the proj@@ ector folder .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode load : check if the plug @-@ in is denied boarding . only @-@ wearing K@@ Parts , usually refuse the store when this option is not selected .
over@@ checked the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , whether the entered information is correct . choose the entry also then if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
from version 3.3 , the de@@ bug fixes completely new . Di@@ e@@ Support for the non @-@ built built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of it was implemented a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin concept , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ires .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the settings . with the option options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug @-@ in box , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually , appears in the left dock .
a view in which all handles , with number numbers and conditions are listed . usually , in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) is shown by the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or a part of the following functionality .
with this action the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger is required , if necessary , or it shares the plugin with , on Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ts . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened when a project is used , which normally does not have to be given to it .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the sounds according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to submit a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start the exec@@ uting of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line @-@ out line . if this happens while the script is continued , the execution is continued . happens before a debit request has been started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start the exec@@ uting of the script without providing information on monitoring variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is attached , the execution goes on . happens before a debit request has been given , the execution starts when a request is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script without going into the functions or clu@@ des of clu@@ des .
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and In@@ clu@@ des will be flaw@@ less .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and to go to the next one , as if there would be the current one .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter discusses how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; to suit your needs and how you can help you to become better .
type Edi@@ ting type Edi@@ ting ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; to give them a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the market @-@ languages and family 2 , the script @-@ languages and &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s contain two file types , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the En@@ er@@ .@@ tag@@ . toolbar icons which include text and instructions faster in a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of Tags as well as the layout and content of the self @-@ document , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . toolbar icons enable a fast inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of writing .
tag files are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files bear the name of the notation language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ up )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declared whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but as only one element type over itself else nothing else .
the type of tags is a script feature . when use is used , att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a better attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describe an attribute of a tags . this item can only happen once for any attribute . it lays down the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains other tags , describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just element type element .
gives the source code used for filling out the attributes in the tag Editor dialog , and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; is used for reaching source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . may be empty or % per day @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can happen for an attribute description only once . it is a only one element element .
puts the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialog . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each and lt ; label &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur within the same tags . this item is an only element type .
returns a list of elements which finish a day . this item is an only element type .
all the Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ elo@@ ation start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be linked and closed .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; do not cause any leg or cause , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; a window to start and over@@ see Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the review occurs only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ;
in the following example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; Schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename to this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example for a functioning Family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ loading .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; / h ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just quite simple and there is an editor available via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ ing@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . this can be edited . by editing a &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can specify with settings actions ... created . click New promotion leads to the same dialogue :
this action is weigh@@ ted keyboard short@@ cut . with clicking the button user @-@ defined button can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with one is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text into the det@@ ain@@ ulated settings and in running the action this text will be inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to start the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tim ; themselves are the Quick start @-@ dialog , or the different Behold in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first the name of the script and interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although skilled paths allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH It gives other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file is called file : / out of the document name .
% P@@ ID : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ od ; only one instance runs , the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP are used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; from an external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script can send a script of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; at the default edition can be determined , which is to send to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected part of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this attitude .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types issue : normal output , written on the default output . it can be specified , which shall be done with the text written by the default output by the value of the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market .
once a toolbar has been added , you must add and configure your actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the fitting toolbar .
complete everything and , in case the tag attributes has and you plan their use , enable you to edit dialog &quot; tag , if available to make a entry when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is represented better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select out of the &amp; pot ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start@@ up as a symbol . by the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as useless , rigid , further interpreted ) or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is to insert a tag in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it must still be associated with the promotion . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tim ; ) and selection of the desired action . beside the text field there is one button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the insert button and continue it with other tags , so there are still which are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the toolbar icons to set the toolbar . make sure that the desired toolbar can be selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ators ( entirely left up ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example I would like to preview a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note that separ@@ ators will support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar ; could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button be .
the new toolbar must be tested by testing all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be placed in the right folder , but your toolbar icons should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar can be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most remarkable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter , how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could look at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository check if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we handle here .
# KDE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html &gt; 2 = func@@ tioning 1.@@ html Day 2 = Day 1.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 5.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tactic .
notice the # ahead Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is the sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit to chess boards ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out .
you notice that the index directory is refer@@ enced directly onto a file ( and consequently the upper end of the tree @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but be careful on &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; - based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resour@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ ters will be replaced .
the table section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that is to be displayed for the design of the context sensitive aid . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of by @-@ ground@@ ed context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file d@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as
if you are sure that these well and worth it are to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not get rich , but proud to have been involved in the best Web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , you are not alone . it is possible to divide the feature resources ( D@@ TE@@ P @-@ packages , work@@ pieces with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email menu entry , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and Visual tree .
resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points they can download . the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and user @-@ used for publication . to sign up a beneficial contribution to what it takes a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may need to find out . in the dialog New resource , you have to empty the input fields ( URL Preview can remain empty ) and with clicking the OK button will be started .
the up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts can be started .
after downloading a resource , still prior to the installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; the integrity of the resource by examination of integrity and Sig@@ nific@@ ation . if the integrity given and the resource is accurate and the resource is correct to be signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages that is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tim ; it is possible to work simultaneously because a D@@ TE@@ P package can be necessary , because hundreds of tag files in the day @-@ XML format could be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D shop and Convert button of a D@@ T@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which is to be used . after that , the following dialogue will appear :
destination directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ el@@ p folder .
! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE definition line : the string , which in ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE tag , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / mut@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d to appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; after converting the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , there are some key concepts . to understand these and take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter will try to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ lers ; little utility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the labour area is divided into three sections : global , locally and proj@@ ect@@ . this distinction involves a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; use , available . by Work@@ place via actions , everything is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different work@@ pieces , actions and patterns in the global tree , which is then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements constitute a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and work@@ pieces . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to work@@ pieces with special promotions especially for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most complete size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powering common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; MDI ; consists of several main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ ing window , the building views , the cart@@ ons with information and the toolbar . please refer to , and for more information about these areas .
one can click the card &apos;s driver with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document templates , to upload , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right click in the Edi@@ tor@@ field lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , processing of under the mouse @-@ cursor , help to the word under the mouse pointer or opening the file , when the string is referred to in the mouse pointer to a file .
at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the toolbar of the editor will currently take , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is displayed as a standard for which a set of toolbar icons . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , the toolbar will be adapted to the new features and related user needs .
the use of toolbar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that represents the day . now , they can insert the data for this just one day . you should insert the data for this just one day ( such as Anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate into the information of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; to navigate , they are to open and ro@@ am . in the representation of cardboard boxes stand for files , project , sample templates , scripts , attributes , and documentation of building views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; this view displays all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by means of right mouse @-@ click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from storage media can be performed using the attached context menu .
another option of goods , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the ground floor . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration into Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script . the right mouse button are available for further functions such as the script to boot , edit or send with e @-@ mail .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . through left @-@ click of an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking an element it opens a list of commands with respect to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other building views . with it can change man@@ ly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . that is based on the contents of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web @-@ technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ te ; &apos; docum@@ ent@@ ations site can be used , and by adding a folder doc to a project can include project @-@ specific documentation , edited and looked at .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two card leaders at the bottom of the window , can be achieved using the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this box @-@ leader displays information on each in Qu@@ anta running script . such as the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes used to D@@ T@@ D are displayed .
this cart@@ ography shows all errors in the mark of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; work@@ tab@@ s are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate side of the toolbar can be defined as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; to define .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; is the ability to send a toolbar with e @-@ mail ; sends the toolbar as a comp@@ ass T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar like any other , save and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points to your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here are not executed .
if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , you should check if your path contains the &amp; KDE ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; KDE ; 3 in PA@@ TH ahead of their bin folder is . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool for KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while striving to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers began to employ &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages editor would ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; KDE ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. now is already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should be qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; therefore the suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; KDE ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tim ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why anyone has developed ? thanks to the &amp; KDE ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to make the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( MDI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by program comp@@ ass , you can notice them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , without having to remember anything script language ( more about it in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for rapid web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more to the detailed documentation is help with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; insert , or k@@ help@@ desk help : / qu@@ anta run ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Wi@@ it@@ ur @ c@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ c@@ de@@ .org .
a quick att@@ acking list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file which is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ device , only one error messages are reported .
conver@@ ts with inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board provided special characters to the &amp; HTML ; S@@ itting , so that it is displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as a form of form@@ atting .
conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; to write , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . first and foremost to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
enables the block@@ choices to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift ; to select down .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages can be found !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not on . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
initial and intim@@ id@@ ation of problem solving at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structural tree .
displays the toolbar to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a single click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries of previous or neighbour , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the fil@@ ename of other documents .
opens an existing project from hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file name .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
browse the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows , e.g. to copy graphics files to your project folders or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; KDE ; and if you have downloaded another one / output module ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ tim ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; projects can be explained by the details .
load a project @-@ tool @-@ toolbar . these are kept in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have associated them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings and you will be added when you want to save the toolbar .
removing a toolbar from the field of view . this does not del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the toolbar you want to do it , you will ask if you want to do that .
this allows you to send their own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. ; team , so that the toolbar can be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar .
allows up@@ loading of toolbar on the main server , wherever anyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; you have done someone else or anyone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; own description .
loading / refresh the entities of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it makes sense when the entities out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; are to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew it . if this global is global and a writing to the global KDE folder is not present , the shop failed .
this menu contains a list of tags , which are present in the currently charged work@@ tab@@ s . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar can be loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is available in the menu tags always available , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points are denied by means of the toolbar , if this day does contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu the available plug @-@ ins listed under the above @-@ listed menu items are listed . click activated . click on a activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated .
select the syn@@ tactic mode for the current file . the list of available posters schem@@ ata depends on the col@@ ates ; -@@ version from .
sel@@ ects the type of Z@@ eil@@ ing identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who using other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application tidy .
immediate inter@@ connection between the different types of the interface . by some limitations in KDE libraries , the reverse mode can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the cart@@ oons mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for every open sub@@ window . with a selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window or out .
the changes in this dialog influences each application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; web browsers .
is the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ window . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; one finds details .
a dialog will appear where you can delete or delete entries from the toolbar or to change the sequences .
this should create an aid in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project , the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; development in financial form can be found here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom , for example by filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all of these paths and author information fields can be set later on Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be adjusted .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine , which you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the selected log files will be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set rather than standards .
this is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files for various projects is used , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused of files that are to be involved somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started again from scratch , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of th@@ inner .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by An@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the program window in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) that can be re @-@ ignored in project @-@ related sur@@ geri@@ es such as proj@@ ections .
comple@@ mentary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are removed from the project .
the project view , which is loaded at the opening of the project . can be read more about project views .
this allows the required de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is available in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button . in the de@@ bu@@ gger option is described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles you can upload up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for any profile , by pointing out a dedicated view to each profile .
in the sub @-@ window configuration configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the sub @-@ window event configuration , one can turn the event action and add these actions , modify or delete . event transactions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as the sick@@ les of a file . see in the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behaviour cannot now be influenced by default .
to open another project , choose the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul is closed , the project file will automatically be stored . you will ask if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project management gives free access to files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behaviour like , however , are missing the entries Open and Open with ... in the right mouse button of the right click menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removing the current profile . if only more a profile exists , the button is shut down to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the kernel memory and forget with program@@ ing . this option is useful when most frequent upload files is needed and the rather non @-@ secure password on the record is not in question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , many high load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog displays :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; KDE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service to the usual port .
depending on your anxiety @-@ shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming results can be easily seen in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and toolbar . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange views , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar .
views can be saved in the menu Project or the Project toolbar , easily accessible or deleted using settings toolbar .
this chapter discusses the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows modification of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; to his own way of working .
as mentioned above , Work@@ bla@@ sts are designed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; best about the toolbar icons . use and adding differ below in the section Ad@@ oration of works @-@ bla@@ sts .
the toolbar icons and the icons to it can be set using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar icons ) , in which with New action , you can ren@@ ame other actions like toolbar , toolbar or toolbar , which can be specified where actions are visible on this or other toolbar .
through the call of the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , you will also be able to remove the entries and show action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up parameters set up in the menu with settings toolbar ... and set settings actions ..
templates are in essential documents , code car@@ ving and files to connect . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; used templates , basically such as a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or delete any existing directory in the pre@@ dict@@ ated tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; in about the limitations that one can imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of every template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; binary files are usually inserted in documents by means of links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the curtain @-@ tree under global templates . further information about the template tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding can be found for the purpose and organizes the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the curtain @-@ tree below global templates . see for more information about the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text range is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are in the curtain @-@ tree below global templates . see in for more information about the template tree .
as the name says , these templates are organized for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a comp@@ uted tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ points .
create a documentation structure to Pop@@ ular ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As template to save as a local template ....
once it has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project situation ) the template is not visible in the project @-@ tree . take a look at the curtain @-@ tree under proj@@ ections .
select text in your document and click File As a template to save a selection as a local / project situation . alternatively , the selection can be drawn with pulling and dra@@ ining on the tree @-@ oriented templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a panel folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and we@@ eping or inser@@ ting the file tree by Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project files , you can select a folder on the right and create site template , secured a name for the template and secure it . by default , it will be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynamically with PHP ; design files or link with them . additionally , one can keep some things in using templates in projects very profound in mind .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder is in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog will appear :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ rupt , as soon as El@@ ter@@ tal Attri@@ bute distor@@ ted .
this is enabled by default and adapted for anything except the master folders in the pre @-@ day overview . if a regular folder would be set in principle unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text blocks . if nothing appears , you will probably be in a regular folder .
allows you set or set text for templates in this folder . these could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation already with the he@@ aders / foot@@ er head@@ lines .
in addition , you have a context menu ( there@@ to show right mouse button ) about a complete command collection for adding folder or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code Editor , which can be reached via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code Editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts : the source code Editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code is visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor in a document , the &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ing of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; Editor , the source code editor will continue to edit . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly as the first , except that simultaneously the changes in the source code and the V@@ PL ; Editor is visible and the cursor in the source code editor and in V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is already active , this mode is already active , puts the press to the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchronization balance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code Editor is set up via settings Qu@@ anta ; View can be set between synchronization after a click or automatically . in the selection automatically the recommendation can be adjusted in addition the time period . basically the recommendation : a small sk@@ il@@ ot for fast calcul@@ ators and a large sk@@ il@@ ot for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools document features are possible . this conclu@@ des the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; Editor . the document features are also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created . this helps to change the following :
meta tags allow storage of information on the document itself e.g. head@@ words for internet search engines . meta @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows the change of content , e.g. key words in column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS @-@ rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as shown in the meta @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not currently supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style shelf by pressing the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is like in a text processing , due to the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing or delete @-@ paste .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way over the toolbar , such as in the source code Editor , which is to be noted , that inser@@ tion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor day , enclosed with text must be removed every other inver@@ ted anchor tag .
some toolbar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they are later used in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; a tool for examination of styl@@ ish@@ templates . in contrast to other programs for styl@@ ish@@ templates , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the sty@@ ling can be prosec@@ uted .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , you need except &amp; KDE , nor the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; KDE .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a fil@@ ename with no path@@ way . fil@@ ename in the same folder as the top loaded file name with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example a period of pre @-@ file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command a partial or complete agreement is checked with a preview named QNA@@ ME or a specified mod@@ us@@ name . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP ME , which contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace shown in the given &quot; QNAP &quot; is added to the rules defined by the name specified in the X@@ SL source file . X@@ SL : test@@ 1 will be extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a decent holding point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and Z@@ eil@@ en@@ code . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . gri@@ pping points are re@@ examined shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphic tools for comparing . so why &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the assemb@@ lance was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors has done many changes and at the same time corrected the cat@@ ap@@ tion . a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts in co @-@ operation .
the program used by me showed me only the modified lines I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the filing had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare quick text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the compar@@ isons .
a function made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and assemb@@ ling of folders . this function turned &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; almost into a complete file browser .
also 3 @-@ way inter@@ merging will be fully supported . this is useful when two persons can work independently of each other at one piece of co@@ ding and make changes . in this editor you can even process the result directly . in this editor you can even process the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three qu@@ ell files in the merging :
&amp; Cou@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the compar@@ isons and assemb@@ ling complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; in the folder together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and can be applied to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check often co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed clearly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can look at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anno@@ y@@ anger , if someone is changing the reverse . )
when a file is equal , and the other is different in a row , the color indicates that file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by writing just the fil@@ ename of the first file . example :
diff@@ use 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the opening @-@ dialog enables the manual type of fil@@ ename , the selection over the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the listing . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons and inter@@ merging of folders will be selected . if for A file is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
when inter@@ merging , the input field will be active and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately set an output file . you can get this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the same / assemb@@ ling .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you do not have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the shut@@ down button .
you can also drag pulling and deposit : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop it on a comparative window .
which thought lies behind it ? sometimes a file contains for example several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , this would be a fairly large effort . you need to create two relevant files , load them in &amp; paste it . now you can copy the relevant sections simply paste , insert and then compare .
note : currently you can pull nothing out &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; only the pit@@ falls of text in a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors are interpre@@ ting and paste text into another program than cutting and paste ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the Info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename , and the number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every@@ one Info @-@ line has a different color . ( when the path to a file is too long , drag the mouse over a while on the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the colour blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preference can be changed via the Settings menu ) .
when a difference is recognized , one can see in the colour which file is distinguished . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the colour scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merging ) well .
left beside the text there is the summar@@ ies column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . with differences in white signs the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the micro@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line which separates the summar@@ ies column of the text is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the igni@@ tion is activated , the line is shown on broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ es ) also has a info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ ename , and &#91; changed &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains through the automatic merger already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the store is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next sol@@ dered / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually at the same time .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows , and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a leap of position in the windows . ) This group will then highlighted the current group . it will be highlighted in the color background color for current area and on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes , through the automatic inter@@ merging or by manual editing no more row exists in the group ; then in these lines the text is displayed . no row is displayed in the row ; there is only one space for the event that you change your opinion and maybe you choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste it elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; breakdown conflic@@ ting ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options numbers ignore or ignor@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ating primarily with the sc@@ rolling and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard left . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the right , side , end , Str@@ g @-@ Start and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also be used by other programs . the super @-@ column in addition to the vertical image bar can be used even to the Navig@@ ate .
in Au@@ gab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the paste button you can switch between plug @-@ in and trans@@ cription mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns you can synchronize the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as mentioned in the section ) and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation that you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image west@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image west@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , to the next / last conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image west@@ wards / Str@@ g @-@ Image ) , to the next / last conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict will continue to be considered a conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be differenti@@ ated .
to copy the marker into the clip@@ board , you must press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this is activated , whatever you select , automatically copy into the clip@@ board and copy the manual . be careful with this option , but you could not over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ers are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line pre @-@ based operating system \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use wagon back@@ sliding + Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ schu@@ b \ \ r \ . K@@ app@@ 3 retains the z@@ eil@@ ing source files not , therefore you should use &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; also not with binary files .
the options and the list of recently used files will automatically be stored automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting &gt; K@@ app@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are presented in cur@@ sive script . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in its pure form , but would be framed . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically shows an odd color .
when this option is activated , inserted at the push of the Tab@@ ulator button the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a t@@ ulator sign is inserted .
if you press input or return , the listing of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is activated , each selection will be automatically copied into the clip@@ board . the manual is to be copied into the clip@@ board .
you can select which type @-@ type you prefer to save . the prescribed value is the generally common selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step is compar@@ es every line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . even while merging , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back@@ log &apos; \ &apos; and a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ vor@@ b &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car back@@ plate is made visible , however , as a white sign treats , however , like a white sign , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default , this option is down@@ lighted . in the first part of the analysis , figures and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default , this option is down@@ lighted . changes in comments will be treated as changes in white signs .
intensive after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files but slow on very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically @-@ forwarding mode , this attitude determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
sol@@ ves off automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful when white signs are less important in many files . if you only use it from time to time , use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ant C / C + + comments .
these options will be treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and transmis@@ sions of a cl@@ apping . look for details under documentation to directory comparison and assemb@@ ling .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version of the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g does exist . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of the interface . the changing of this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit and restart it , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is employed globally across the control center . )
the following enco@@ ding controls can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you have enabled this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the range fields for co@@ ding appears a short indication of what the local co@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different co@@ ding can be compared and merged .
if you have a file edited , you can specify which encoding for storing should be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing command , they might not work with your co@@ de@@ c . ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be done with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress Her@@ lighting of changes in white signs in the text or over@@ views . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing or cap@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . after choosing A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B is displayed ; C or B is shown in addition to the normal yet a second super column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . make sure you simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu ) .
orders the same side by side or another . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu ) .
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the cl@@ apping and uses the fil@@ ename of the last source file as pre @-@ issued name for output file . ( if this function is used to start the merging once again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will pass on to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own generator , which meets exactly your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or correct the assessment .
when reading a file , it is passed first to this remote command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used to input this command command . you can write your own generator above . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external application is required , and most users would like to program that not themselves . the good news is however , that in most cases is sed or per@@ l completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for z@@ eil@@ ing to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ U \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ 1 in the Re@@ plac@@ eable string refers to the found text in large letters . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all the \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ ( revision \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you &apos;re experimenting with sed experim@@ entation , you may start to understand it and maybe you like those regular expressions , even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ app@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example of a further processing command for Z@@ eil@@ ing . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a suitable matches , and each suitable matches is replaced by nothing , so that is practically deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead , you can also need something different such as per@@ l use@@ . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are needed at per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the &quot; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and assemb@@ ling . further operations can only change the data that is the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ched @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ dict@@ ator , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ary pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you need to edit programmers in a folder lots of files . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object to create a proposal ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can sim@@ ulate the assemb@@ ling and displays the sim@@ ulated changes without it really carry out ,
... takes selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and assemb@@ ling of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no target folder is specified , used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start the cl@@ ash . to start the merging , you must press the respective menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
while reading the folder will inform you a small message window on the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed there , which were compared to that .
if the scanning the folder is finished , displays &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found in the scan will be found here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub @-@ directories , and all sub @-@ directories folders with which you can capture all folders and folders .
if you double click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it appears a comparison window .
the icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the assemb@@ ling @-@ off action can not be selected automatically . if the merging will be started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the above picture , are used in columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black .
with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders will be considered identical if its entire content is identical . then also folder the same color . in folders , age is im@@ material for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a Bl@@ att@@ es back , which is only green , then yellow will and later when it is old , red is red .
... A and C identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if there exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merging cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , the merging cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and when the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then select &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the required action to save both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merge together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees the visible file name for output file only B ; right after the merger may be copied &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option new file will be used instead of con@@ duction . if the files are different , but the same date is identical . if the files are different , but the same date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not removed , the merging of the folder can not be started .
while merging a file after the other , you work on one file after the other . you status column displays skills when the co @-@ run was successful , and according to other messages if something in@@ accurate occurred . if the merging is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the interior dialog is chosen the file method of complete analysis , K@@ app@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of monasteries , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all of the compositions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merging .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder interaction mode , it will be used as the target , used in the two @-@ folder merging , B as the destination and when it is used , A and / or B is used as a destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options over which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid un@@ loving surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory assemb@@ ling / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to run only the current entry : select promotion of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if through conflic@@ ting file types still invalid , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options flow , sim@@ ulate and break down .
select sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes will be made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merging window opens ( notice the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again directory assemb@@ ling / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog will appear . then leads &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; his work with the next entry .
if you look at a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that should help you to check out the cause of the problem . you &apos;ll have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding .
if some entries were individually combined , you notice &amp; diff@@ use all entries ( in the current session ) and will lead them up at the later of all entries . even if the merging of entries was transferred or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the assemb@@ ling action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ app@@ 3 ) has now a section called Invent@@ ory with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( such as * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . folder must not match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered into the elementary tree ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered into the elementary tree ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files which are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is to be adjusted specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a file is displayed as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
when links to files : when the option is off , symbolic link@@ ages compared . when the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
on links to folders : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that a link can lead to a link loop and &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; ) This option is switched on the default .
exec@@ utes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of Del@@ eted de@@ for@@ ter , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files that does not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster , only the chan@@ gel@@ ist and the file size compared . however , this speed test will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is plug@@ ged into default .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical . this can be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is plug@@ ged into default .
activ@@ ates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified in this mode . in this mode , the suggestions for interaction results are selected . also , the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders . this option is switched in default .
if there are differences , instead the merging of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe , because it &apos;s the knowledge provided that the other file is not also changed . ) This option is plug@@ ged in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed and maintains the extension .@@ orig@@ ine . if an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also affect normal inter@@ merging of individual files , not just the merging of individual files , not just the merging of an existing folder . this option is switched on in the default .
usually , the folder crash stays visible from the merging of individual files ; you can move the window but@@ or with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option list &amp; text window into the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , in the directory menu , you can also run a corresponding menu navigation menu . once you save the result , the status will be done and the file will not be merged once again when you merge the folder together .
this status is however lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : new to read
KDE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ app@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relatively und@@ own . or .. included . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ cot . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file associated with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol . it follows a brief list of constraints :
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated if a link indicates a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit authorization or modification of change . therefore , the eligi@@ bility or change date from the original . ( consider the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
the main purpose of use is currently as differences with viewers in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in @-@ in @-@ viewer . to run K@@ lamp@@ 3 , press the right button of mouse on the difference viewers and then select In Cas@@ diffusion 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; two complete input files . however , when it is applied as a part , takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ app@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the merging or the same of folders will not support in the part @-@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ app@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist es Com@@ are ) are already there . in addition , the name K@@ elo@@ 3 already points out that it can result together as the program diff@@ use the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs for very long and have learned a lot since I &apos;ve watched in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or going to be so going .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be told the correct pre@@ fix . in the default configuration in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are usually treated as identical . if however , only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines made up next to each other , this is ste@@ is the attribute this is made of the case .
the editor notes each difference in the files where it begins and where he ends . this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information goes out however , if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could save this information .
the effort for it was so far too big . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used by another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has left ; published and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight of differences . even more her@@ b@@ ulation would be confusing and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and news reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use them , you need &amp; KDE ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ lamp@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ log , or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ log in the Qu@@ ell @-@ package .
to compile &amp; paste 3 ; in a system with &amp; KDE ; to compile and install , use the following command at the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto @-@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; KDE , mailing lists of it .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies in the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position and replace the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and therefore also not in the target folder .
( in the current program version you must re @-@ update the folder after changes to these options . )
there are only entries indicated that the differences are shown . if the target folder files are not already copied in the target folder . if the target folder of these files does not already exist , they are probably missing after the merger . ( the behaviour will be switched on in a later program version . ) This option is switched on the default folder .
note the buttons to choose the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be displayed at the end of the selected group in result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking on the button accordingly .
in the default , this option is disabled . under@@ score in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini@@ preview of all virtual working surfaces . it is quite convenient to view the ongoing programs on the desktop , to change its size , to end it or move it . this works both within a desktop and for several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working surfaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and to the other .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible either within a desktop and on other work@@ space .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; clicked , the context menu clicked only the two entries P@@ ager ... and Be@@ fore . however , the icon and the name of the application , as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ise , on desktop and filling . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only if on a application was clicked on .
send the application to selected virtual desktop . appears only if on a application was clicked on .
if this An@@ gle @-@ box marked , you can move windows inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces .
when this field is listed , the name of the virtual working surfaces are displayed .
tick@@ ing this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual working surfaces . is it attached along with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ in@@ al@@ pay , &amp; eg ; 1 . working area .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop appears as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is attached , the ongoing programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window will be selected . simply displays simple right angles with the proportions of the program window . symbol displays the window with its standard icon and Pix@@ map showing a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is to be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; available in a 2@@ x@@ n grid ; horizont@@ ally shows all virtual working spaces in a horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very suitable for the representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can display in size , display windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control panel .
click the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select the switch from switch to set ... lets the dialog settings appear .
at the moment not the dialog settings may be changed . you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ an c with any text editor , like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI@@ .@@ If you do not have any writing to the file , you need to register as user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you have to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and have a value to it . possible values are :
da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functioning installation of KDE basic packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use with &amp; k@@ mag . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , Web @-@ designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; CT ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended by new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you &apos;re using &amp; k@@ mag , appears a window like above . the main window of the screen appears . in the following this window will appear as a magni@@ fying window .. the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged part of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting is magni@@ fied &amp; k@@ likes ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor as a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively you can put a selected screen range in the magni@@ fier window ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor on the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
would you like to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse pointer in the enlarged window . please note that &amp; k@@ mag . this is still not able to recognize the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard KDE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selective mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mo@@ ons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse pointer in the magnific@@ ation window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can catch the contents of the magnific@@ ation window and move it . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; button press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection pane . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain stuck , and only the lower right hand is to move .
&amp; sounded , has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to paste into a file into the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) to turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . the stops can be updated that the required CPU @-@ time goes against 0 .
choose the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , medium , high @-@ high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection pane will be displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your incoming short command to save files , opening a new window , print , new@@ bie ( with the button document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and ver@@ min@@ ers &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a range of screen to view the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from research or artist to web@@ designer or visually imp@@ aired .
detailed account documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( enter either this URL in the address bar by &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start the help@@ desk help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is distor@@ ted for a while at the same point . it is meant to help people suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse @-@ cursor is for a while at the same point . it is meant to help people suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) &apos;s syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click pain is prepared . however , it may require a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer due to the mere identi@@ fier of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it even more clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid the cause when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain , which is caused by the cause of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse @-@ click when you inter@@ rupt the movement shortly .
if the smart t@@ anning is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it has em@@ bo@@ iling the mouse button . now , move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before the slo@@ ping can run the mouse button . in this way , you can execute the drag @-@ right mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drop @-@ down mouse button . this smart t@@ anning requires a little practice , but you get used to get used to it quickly .
this devast@@ ation must be du@@ sty after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; one mouse @-@ click leads .
is enabled by intelligent delay , the rot@@ ational field is de@@ void ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is waiting before it leaves the mouse button again if there is no time left over the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click of mouse @-@ displ@@ ac@@ ement . this function is activated , creates a slow bending due to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow bending system stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt for the first time it will be started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction times , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the tab Android . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer to shor@@ ten you to a lower value to shor@@ ten the reply .
if this setting marks , is started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at every start of &amp; KDE ; started . this function is currently only under &amp; KDE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please check the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
sets all the settings back on the values that were set when opening the dialog . did you already apply the button down , the settings will apply to the stand after the last squee@@ ze .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with preference . in particular , the smart t@@ anning you should first let off . if you then hit the automatic mouse button , you can then go to the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to verify the answers of &amp; KDE ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not display any link , does not lead to un@@ solic@@ ited reactions . you can therefore park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is ru@@ gged , you should puri@@ fy your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you will not only clean@@ se the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take the mouse over the mouse . as this happens , from mouse to mouse different . but it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and dirt can easily scr@@ apped with a flat blade or the finger @-@ hed@@ gehog .
in very rare situations the operating system collap@@ sing the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; when you have just begun a delay , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool means that the operation cannot finish more by the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; used under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is to run yourself a mouse @-@ click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset ; and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to the place where you want to have it . but you can no longer run the mouse on a neutral part of the desktop , if you don &apos;t want to cause a keyboard short@@ cut . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor is a privilege ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of the windows .
I try to work with the smart t@@ anning , but I don &apos;t get it to edit text .
the smart t@@ anning is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy text to copy it into the clip@@ board and want to carry back any other action to move back into the clip@@ board . but there will probably not even cause problems . here are some advice on it :
do not use the smart t@@ anning , if you are just beginning to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead : execute a mouse click at the one end of the text box and keep the switching mouse button pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and keep the mouse button again .
therefore , use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . it becomes jed@@ es@@ times when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so , you know exactly when when the smart t@@ anning the delay time begins . later you can use the intelligent t@@ anning even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it needs some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window ; installed in most cases the case should be the case .
the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound@@ card and speaker and are properly furnished .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pl@@ ung@@ ed the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor is short ver@@ ted . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and which the bed of the mo@@ ist pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button will be loos@@ ed . in this way can also drag and cut off with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the bl@@ unt user to let her computer speak for themselves .
the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te user can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk of propositions which should be talked again .
on the first page of the wizard ( linear screen photo ) enter the command that will later be used for voice output . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings .
on the second page you choose the standard text@@ book @-@ book . from the text @-@ car text@@ books you can often choose text @-@ passages without having to touch it . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you will determine the dictionary for the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ emer@@ al . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can use the wording of the single words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary . in addition , you can be added to the wording of the words into the words of the words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a reference memory of the already spoken sets ( the top white box in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; properly addressed , you can type in the input field the propositions which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the default memory . you can select it sets that are to be talked again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ emer@@ al and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card @-@ card , you enter the command for the call of language @-@ generator . in the selection box below the input field , you specify the strings with which the text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the check@@ box if the text should be passed on to the language generator as default .
if the text box is not selected , the text is distributed as a parameter . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder :
of course , the command will depend on the language of your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with as possible use as a language service , it is used as a language service to pass on the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the additional settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , the &amp; KDE ; applications are a stand@@ ardis@@ ed interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text @-@ car text@@ book or in the list for text @-@ fitting books .
with the selection of so@@ jour@@ n , the selected text passage will be spoken directly and additionally inserted into the box @-@ mounted tank . with the selection of in the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box closing the editing window for text @-@ car book you can specify whether the text@@ book @-@ book for the closing of the editing window will be automatically saved .
the book will save the text@@ book . if you choose any changes , the text@@ book is not saved , the text@@ book will not be saved , will ask for storing , will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ emer@@ al contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ ies . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ emer@@ al .
with the buttons right on the page you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or export the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and the language for the dictionary .
choose the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; KDE documentation ; the frequency of individual words is simply determined by Ab@@ count of the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org @-@ dictionary to include only written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can run the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask what dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together , and how these fears are to be examined .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly defined words automatically adds to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary through the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text @-@ car books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text@@ books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text message , you can only change its name .
actions like new text @-@ passages or books add or delete selected text messages and books , you can either directly reach the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a folding menu .
the order of text @-@ car or text @-@ passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; - key .
the chosen text is cut off and copied into the clip@@ board . if the text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the flow store .
the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . if the text box is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the flow store .
the currently active phrase is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the flow store .
this menu entry is sealed with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar panel is arranged by default over the editing window directly below the menu bar . by clicking on the animated left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is scrat@@ ched , a narrow down list is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not listed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is listed , a shifting bar is displayed for text @-@ fitting books with entries . the ly@@ re is arranged by default over the editing window directly below the toolbar . by clicking on the animated left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another place .
you probably have the command for voice output not properly or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card voice language . ( see Settings dialog for language syn@@ thesizer to further details . )
Festival is a language version at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and further dissemin@@ ate any restrictions .
to show an example of a command line for setting the voice output is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to language is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a unique language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . currently , it only allows the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and further dissemin@@ ate without restrictions .
to show an example of a command line for setting up the voice output is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et . language version is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example the option must be enabled as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ gs into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to send the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / BA@@ R _ / usr / local / net@@ ro@@ la / dev / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ h@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data is enabled as default .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; KDE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; KDE ; - further language service , which provides all &amp; KDE ; - applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice systems .
because the setting of language @-@ generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a language service as a language service in &amp; mouth .
to set up the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; KDE ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual of your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who can not speak to print text by the computer . it is saved a list of already written phrases which the user can always have res@@ igned again .
note that &amp; Y@@ mouth does not include a language syn@@ thesizer . on the machine a language syn@@ thesizer needs to be installed .
detailed account documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar by &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start the help@@ desk help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; KDE ; - is one of modules of existing services that allows every application to read text on the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part @-@ system in &amp; KDE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it presents a common use interface for &amp; KDE ; programmer ready to be equipped with which their applications are equipped with T@@ TS @-@ capabilities . also the users offers interesting possibilities .
reading of texts ( or parts thereof ) in the Tex@@ ts@@ di@@ tor &amp; K@@ ate ; even if &amp; K@@ ate ; in other &amp; KDE , applications are embedded .
the language output takes place via the program Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; used .
enables the generation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ auxiliary program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up @-@ meta @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice service of &amp; KDE , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS @-@ services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for the configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the Tex@@ ts@@ di@@ tor &amp; K@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; KDE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bus@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about htt@@ ps : / / bus@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mailing info / KDE Acces@@ sibility . the developers can also find in the IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # KDE Acces@@ sibility ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to install and adjust program Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r or as long as yet no spokes@@ person is set up , the card card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card Ticket is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that differ in volume or speed . you can also set several variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least establish a spokes@@ man before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker .
different spokes@@ man for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple printers for the same printer .
if you click on the cart@@ oons leader in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r , the card card speaker is shown . this also appears automatically if you start top@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r and yet no spokes@@ man is established .
all the already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear above in the list . the top@@ most spokes@@ man is used for voice purposes if an application is not present@@ er .
select one speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select one speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select one speaker from the list and click on this button to put the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines also its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ as ; system application .
select here a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ k and maid &apos;s vote to choose from .
if you click here , appears on the new speaker at the card speaker speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost using it . go back to the card card information and check whether the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; KDE released . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text presentations . click on the card map to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the voice system of &amp; KDE . click on the Options tab in order to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this link to activate the &amp; D system ; this starts the KDE T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this start is successful , the card Ticket is displayed and can be read and read . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD will hold and the T@@ TS @-@ system of &amp; KDE ; de@@ activated .
if top@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r is finished , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; on , provided the field language is activating ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this An@@ gle @-@ box marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ r appears automatically in the control panel of the control panel , it disappears again as soon as the advance is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start text messages , stop and resume and resume .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; KDE , clip@@ board and open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click to apply or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card @-@ card orders will only be shown when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the Options tab and activate voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; KDE , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs , then select text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time the voice should begin .
it is almost always reasonable to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step but then many &amp; HTML ; - he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read too .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; KDE ; , you can read the text before . check first whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs , then select the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tools text to read . then the language version should start .
this also works when &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; KDE , which will notify you of posted events . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; KDE , you can set up different types of messages . you can specify different types of messages . you can notify you , when in a IR@@ C channel a message appears if your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; KDE , program K@@ No@@ tify , appears a menu entries in the menu Settings menu . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
filter for drawing composition measures a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or incorrect information to correct . the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is not sent to package and b from the news , the K@@ Mail is sent , and also the print@@ out / local / In@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases than provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
filtering is being sent , before he will be sent to Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false words or abbreviations , select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with specific def@@ ici@@ encies of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . there are four types of texts .
the output of screen re@@ members has the highest priority . it will be drawn from all other orders and holds this orders . if the output of screen reader is pre @-@ read , the orders orders will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the warning .
News have the nearest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page can be read , you can go to &amp; mouth ; someone who just enter the room . &amp; KDE ; notices are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text messages . each order you encounter from the card &apos;s orders is a text@@ order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text messages . text messages are meant for the issue of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queue , with the exception of the issuing of screen revisions . if an application sends the output of a screen @-@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this issue will be stopped and terminated .
first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen revisions . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text messages as well as on KDE , messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts can be delivered either as words or as a regular expressions . it will be supplied with pre@@ defined string qu@@ ests such as : - ) by text or for the reform@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; - re@@ former use a X@@ S@@ LT @-@ file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in the package range . are some X@@ S@@ LT files to translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker cable filtering , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set the text message for example on the card @-@ card speaker , you can read text of KDE @-@ news about it .
each of these different filters has a adjustable rules , after which he is used for voice purposes . if the filter does not indicate that his rules cannot apply , he will continue the text to the next filter more unchanged .
if a text@@ book , a message , warning or a &amp; KDE ; notification is sent , it is edited by all activated filters supplied on the page . the processing by the filter is done in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . is a filter does not inter@@ sect , it is not activated and is not used . filter are lab@@ elled from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown further below the following piece of furniture .
if you enter a list of words or regular expressions , you will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . large and small @-@ f@@ use is not observed when compared .
enter a name for your filter . this name allows you to select any number , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter is comparing the text with the strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list , the entries are displayed from the file to the existing list .
is a language entered here , the filter is only used when the speaker speaks for the text@@ book one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse @-@ clicking the &amp; C@@ trl ; button pressed .
if a value is registered , the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can type several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ ID cycle programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers , you need to escape . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID @-@ 34@@ 32 points , you may only enter copies .
the drawing effect filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box diabe@@ tic filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when compared with words the character sets of the word \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) .
in this guide you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; KDE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Supp@@ liers &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package deu@@ deu@@ ce .
&amp; XML ; - Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; by using X@@ S@@ LT @-@ files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be applied on well @-@ shaped XML . the Help program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the ambient variable PA@@ TH is also available x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the speaker cable filter , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is placed on the cart@@ o@@ pass speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example define that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text directed to the filter , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is presented by the speaker properties that sends the program , and selected the properties of the speaker card spokes@@ person . with the speaker cable , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
here is a value registered , the filter is applied in case the text contains the regular regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; KDE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this by clicking on the button to obtain help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DA@@ TA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place here the characteristics of the desired filtering conditions . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements most . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box .
use these buttons to save or delete your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the speaker optional filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box den@@ otes , if not apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output , by &amp; KDE , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS @-@ capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; KDE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output of &amp; KDE ; the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on KDE ; Acces@@ sibility Website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface between &amp; KDE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start only top@@ ts@@ d in one window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ r in the other .
none of the named language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; self @-@ formal filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read off .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male UK ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE does not work at all . you also need to do that if you do not use this voice to pre @-@ read web pages . furthermore , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and over the ambient variable PA@@ TH .
certain signs or interval characters seem to cause mistakes with the syn@@ thesizer , so that all propositions can be printed or only g@@ ust @-@ cat@@ ching . what can I do against it ?

the language syn@@ thesizer , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the related websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the KDE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ ported under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / KDE / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the mentioned languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages rate . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adaptable module @-@ architecture for language syn@@ thesizer . if you would like to expand &amp; kt@@ as ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not imperative . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages , and the development files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ ported or have downloaded the ball @-@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check first if Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; KDE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that is used the program Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g@@ r is designed to be developed so that the setup of Spe@@ ech Disp@@ at@@ cher is not required anymore and the script SPD it is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ assembled in individual propositions . the user can go back - or devi@@ ate rep@@ ell@@ ent , repeat the issue or break down .
if an application provides text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , it may request the properties of the preferred spokes@@ person for the output . thus , an application can request a female English speaker . if you choose one speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , this will automatically choose the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; one speaker sel@@ ects , see you in .
if you click on adding speakers to adding and then click on adding a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card @-@ card spokes@@ person is shown . as an example , the setting of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the strings for text that will be handed over to festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you make volume , Interphone velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can not choose a few regul@@ ator and this gray can be displayed , the voice you cho@@ oses not set these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded on account of their size several seconds after their size , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( a large storage area ) , the first set will be more quickly syn@@ thes@@ ized .
if this tick @-@ box can not be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to apply ) .
if this An@@ gle @-@ box marked , is displayed at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r the program window t@@ g@@ r . otherwise , after starting only the icon t@@ ear@@ g@@ r in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this An@@ gle @-@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r does not exp@@ ire , it appears in the system field , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD has to read a text . this gives you the opportunity to read or control it in any other way .
here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the just edited sentence . the speaker id corresponds to the column ID on the card card speaker .
with the buttons in this row you can go to the order from the list , which is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of settings ( including the other card cards ) are adopted and top@@ t@@ sm@@ r becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also .
here are only text records listed and managed . issues of screen re@@ moves , warnings and messages are not shown . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , has been compiled &amp; kt@@ as ; either without support for the corresponding audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or kt@@ as ; the necessary libraries can not load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select here the PC@@ M device .
set the velocity @-@ speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % is equivalent to the double normal speaker speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click to apply the new settings for the ongoing &amp; kt@@ as ; system to take over .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device will work with you . in doubt you choose standard .
this card card allows you to set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text@@ book is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language contracts :
the output of screen re@@ members has the highest priority . it is drawn from all other orders and holds this orders . after the output of screen reader has been read , the included orders are re @-@ recorded .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . this orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have a long text on a web page , you can welcome you with &amp; Y@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who enter the room .
if a text@@ book is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in queue .
this audio file will always be played if a normal text@@ book is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message .
the settings on this card card apply only to normal texts . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen revisions , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ No@@ tify messages to be read , start top@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r and click al@@ erts . the card notices appears .
select this link to turn the pre@@ read of &amp; KDE ; it is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no al@@ erts .
if this attitude is marked , noti@@ fications , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list or to delete it . if you click on the Add button , a dialog will appear where you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the news that sends &amp; conversation ; if someone mentioned in a IR@@ C message your nick@@ name .
all the events , which in the list are not stated otherwise , are ignored and ignored .
use this selection box to define what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following selections :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker , which is displayed on the list on the card card spokes@@ person as the top listing .
note that there are three levels of events . for a particular event of a certain application an action is set , this will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of certain applications is executed . as the last option comes the action to carry out the one under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the al@@ erts as follows :
use the button save to save the settings for the notification in a file . use the button shop to load stored settings from a file . the invited events will start with the events in the list . if you want to begin using an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except for all de@@ posit@@ ors will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output , the speaker speed , the sex of the voice and pitch . moreover , brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of e.g. abbreviations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you will need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( Bri@@ table man ) since this is the default vote , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog will not be limited to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DA@@ TA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ C@@ TY@@ PE / etc / Spe@@ ech @-@ Syn@@ thesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama Be@@ ar . who slept in my bed ? asked the Bär@@ en@@ Child . &#93; &#93; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ filing filters ( SD@@ S@@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds can also be syn@@ thes@@ ized , because only the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text assignment . with this , you can also check or cancel the entire text contract , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support it directly .
here you see the pro@@ filing of recognition . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a statement by a pro@@ filing of recognition . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ bility filters , but the beginners will not get out of it .
in the easiest way to try out the setup of the speaker selection , select the speaker selection , what speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; choose a few features and check how the selection of the spokes@@ person has changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ as ; then faster with which can be read , because only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can hold text messages directly on the card @-@ card orders or break down even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal proposition is automatically set up automatically when you start top@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r for the first time . it can not be switched off , just removed . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
typ@@ o patterns in this text compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ imal characters 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal characters are removed from the text ) . note that the standard set limits for the character does not maintain .
SB@@ D @-@ filters will never be applied to &amp; KDE ; News ( k@@ iller ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen revisions .
if you have removed the normal set of knowledge filters , you can insert it again by clicking the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
on the card card speaker selection , you can over@@ write the Spe@@ ech settings for the application . the card card will be shown if
use of the default speaker ( the top@@ most on the card spokes@@ person ) . in other words , there are no speaker properties .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which displays all properties of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise sel@@ ects &amp; kt@@ ts ; the spokes@@ man , which corresponds to the original properties originally introduced .
select the method to enter the desired page properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything one .
select this tick@@ le field if the property must have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also put several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output is , this feature is always treated as a priority property . you will probably use this property . the only case if you possibly want to specify the attribute language , is ahead if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all properties in the field of speaker , which corresponds to the following to delete , click the default speaker and then use on speaker , which corresponds to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text@@ order in queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ g@@ r falls off immediately when it is started . I have de@@ activated de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get any trac@@ tions .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is cr@@ ashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was probably finished . probably you have to register G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is not installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ spre@@ amer .
the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I want to play music at the same time with another application . if I get a text message , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that said to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA can prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . references for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ r will not show that voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a tutorial , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; in which you found the voice to the developers .
on the map audio there is a setting of speed . so this works , the program must be installed as so@@ x and installed over the ambient variable PA@@ TH . some Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ er@@ mod@@ ul@@ s like Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed up . depending on your chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; html ; ( this is because that the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or if you are totally coura@@ geous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ form@@ atted filter , and set the velocity @-@ speed up .
I don &apos;t manage to be read web pages with a female voice . I have established a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag SA@@ BLE Gender does not seem to work . therewith , festival does not produce any mistakes , the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own drawing element composition and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ as ; no more sat@@ ary - or go back . on the box @-@ rated order is shown , the order is done only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
interval characters ( point , question mark , outlet , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use for these characters instead a filter to the pro@@ posi@@ bility detection .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
g@@ stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or newer . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ sta@@ amer by calling for using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST @-@ register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio @-@ output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you stop a text message in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the current sentence will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general adjustment of the intercom speed , but otherwise it is not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x using the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ as ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ extrac@@ ting archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; KDE ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least once again created on request .
the following modules for language syn@@ thesizer are created by default . some of these possess a runtime @-@ dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Debian distribution ) . the configure option to turn off the setup parameter , which causes the move of the output .
as a default , the folder is installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination using the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination .
on Debian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ ported echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; In@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ F Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd @-@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume speed , velocity and pitch .
you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions which are delivered with festival . want to read web pages , you must install the ( male UK ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transfer .
this voice sets the festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you type the Russian votes , you need to enter for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone _ di@@ phone . choose a ky@@ dy ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distribu@@ tions . look for festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the codi@@ fication has to be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ cally such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ cal analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; generates additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival produces these of &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . further information can be found under .
for this procedure additional Wr@@ apper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; voices of language synthesis . note that the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; stim@@ uli are not installed in &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; folder files are installed , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions find below

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; one module for the &amp; &apos; contro@@ l@@ center ; to facilitate the management of network interfaces , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; cinem@@ atic center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; &apos; contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selection of K Menu or contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings is displayed in the &amp; L _ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; cat @-@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not install . physical devices and their drivers have to be func@@ tionally installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and enables the setting of network features .
in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices later added , the drivers must be loaded through adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version .
the module network settings is loaded , when the option is selected for network settings in the &amp; Back@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected . when starting the module network settings , this is automatically trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the commercial selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and releasing the release is best matches . by flag@@ ging the setup non @-@ again , the definition can be permanently made . at the next start of network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can be viewed only , the Chang@@ ing is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will find by clicking the button administration mode on the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the total functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . by the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings indicated can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to set up the button .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Ex@@ tended Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options .
with the selection of Autom@@ atically , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address will be performed with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ D or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP address at every system start , so no further adjustment may be required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection of Manual without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be set out for TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is the sub@@ net mask .
if this adjustment is marked , initi@@ alizes the system the network interface when boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be enabled .
the values contained in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off according to your needs . switching on the network interface is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switch off the activated network mode by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
puts the IP address of the calculator in the local sub@@ net which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with networks in other sub @-@ networks .
if the computer is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is to be selected .
a computer with DNS @-@ support replaces a complete residence permit by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p / / www.@@ ser@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org is required , the DNS accepts this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the host to name @-@ resolution part of the rider name solution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified by selecting an order and up @-@ up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons or can be ordered in a priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group Computer to the attri@@ tion solution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the new nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group Computer to the naming solution , select an entry and then click the Edit .... It will display the dialog box .
the List named named Calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP @-@ address @-@ references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by boats if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS server .
normally , the list of specifically known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this is still going to replace the version of IP in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New alias dialog will be shown .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several ali@@ ases , de button Ad@@ ding several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of an specifically known computer from the list and choose Edit .... The dialog to edit a friend .
it may be one of the following tasks run , then clicking on OK , the list of static hosts updated .
the settings that are made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command needs to be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distribu@@ tions ( usually rpm packages ) , it ranges when &amp; KDE ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; using rpm as below to install :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphic user such as c@@ package , or the installation tool for their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; KDE is sufficient , but in addition the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile it . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; variable configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found big distribution . by IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore concentr@@ ating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; Work@@ place is the network administrator which may apply a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be chosen as desired . in any case , the IP address can not be selected as desired !
when inser@@ ting a separate small ( home ) network , IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address connections with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks mostly addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers participants are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ r ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back ad@@ ress ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP re@@ direction .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually , the address is associated with 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are placed in the different distribu@@ tions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically to DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand then expected can occur .

&amp; soldier ; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . it provides the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective un@@ pack . the second goal was to answer a question which my wife asked : how much longer it takes when you ass@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be controlled by &amp; b ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; # ; sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre@@ tensions of the banker . recognizes and soldier ; the pres@@ cribe to the tape are not , you will ask if the band should be form@@ atted .
realize &amp; b ; the pres@@ cribe , it searches for the matching index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be wondering if the band@@ index is to be created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol changes to the belt drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the belt can now be searched through by means of the entry for the band .
before sow@@ ing the ban@@ ana , first of all , the integration must be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; soldier ; returns through a change of the symbol for the band that the integration of the band has been solved , and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger .
before a band of &amp; b ; can be used it must be form@@ atted as a soldier .
a band@@ age must form@@ atted before you use to store data . this process does not necessarily need to form@@ atted it . this process does not necessarily need to form@@ atted it before you can form@@ atted it before your use . flo@@ ppy disks are usually not form@@ atted a form@@ atting of the belt , DA@@ T drives , but not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; b ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the form process , the band will be automatically mounted and is ready for use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the securing files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be saved to that file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in local file tree with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the disk . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives on the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test process has been started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialog you can check again your selection and change the folder sub@@ folders for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time .
before you manage the restore , the files you need to be restored , this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the belt drive . it will only be restored to select the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the so selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose to restore ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ ad file using the belt content . this process is del@@ etes all existing Inde@@ x@@ files for this band . you can create index on two different types of volume :
here , a backup profile is created with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should be made . the list of selected files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , is that only those files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder that are stored on other file systems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is considered independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used only , which have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshots file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons , gt ; and lt ; lt ; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating these documentation .
you can set up the settings on menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the band@@ age ( usually / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ command variant of the tape .
is this setting actively , transm@@ its and soldier ; before the band is involved the command load load to the drive . with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing @-@ operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , tries &amp; b ; the throw at the belt running gear . possibly this attitude does not work with all the belt drives .
if the option is switched on , when solving the integration of &amp; b ; automatically the tape is rejected . use this option not at flo@@ ppy stream .
if the option is enabled , tried &amp; b ; the hard@@ core block size can be changed for the belt drive . no all drives support variable block@@ ages . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you have to notify &amp; b ; in any case , the block size for your belt drive communicate .
when a soldier : a band form@@ atted it writes a file to the beginning of the bank@@ note . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is billing : seconds , with the name of the complete name of the system , on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds , which since the epoch has been form@@ atted in which the belt has been form@@ atted .
the band @-@ ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ ern@@ ing .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives which allow themselves directly to &amp; GNU ; - tar can be managed . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup database . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; is a &amp; KDE ; viewers for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . furthermore , allows &amp; systematic log ; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; helps users understand what your machine is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ systematic log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited with the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; systematic log ; experienced users give quick access to information on issues related to their server . &amp; conc@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions , using which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ systematic log ; a number of useful features include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Samba
many other functions are also contained in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot displays &amp; conc@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort out . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the k@@ systematic log ; first the most important protocol of the system - the system Protocol - to open it . it will not be displayed , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you can not find a small message window . the protocol files can usually be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user does not usually have permission to read .
you can also use the fil@@ ter@@ bar to filter by selected criterion or after having entered a string . in the default setting , the list box contains the entry box next to the filter . then a protocol line contains only displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included .
you can of course choose another entry . the string of the filter search will then only be replic@@ ated with the entries in the respectively selected column . for example , select the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; a systematic log ; all the protocol lines sent , which is sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in default and helps you see the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error will be shown with a con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol lines . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can test the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the Start of Samba server . in this case , you will use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to display new lines in the context menu of the main window in order to display all the new record @-@ lines .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ systematic log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ so@@ ftw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information on the sources of transfers from &amp; k@@ systemic log ;
&amp; conc@@ system@@ log ; find also in the following folder of the &amp; KDE -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; KDE ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; KDE ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section lists some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V in@@ it rapidly develops to the standard for checking the program at the high driving of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not enter here further into historical aspects ( among others , because I do not know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to make a machine on System V in@@ it , without a re@@ install and reform@@ atting . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service , which you want to start at the peak of the system or when changing to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not involve such things such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such a call belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand at / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even though it does not actually have much use to do so . you can also let a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run on driving something that has to do with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the standard Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following at the beginning :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the pre@@ viewed Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can fix it / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful , if you have a slightly propag@@ ation , then you come to restart the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type -@@ l enter into r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how does and stopping in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K contains , the script will start with the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have a server -@@ Run@@ level , which lets only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , that &apos;s &amp; b ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial : just drag an entry from the area of available system services on one of the six rounds level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position inside a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if the entry is from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only does not happen if they have an entry in the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved , if you want to move them into a new zone . to simply copy it to a new Run@@ level , you will need to select explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu , and paste it into the target area - even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to add the system service .
note : at present there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the trash . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work@@ areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . connect the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are running .
all settings will be stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have been experimenting with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine starts durability . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for the execution under runtime X , but they will not be executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit extra files in / etc that are available only in these distribu@@ tions . please read the details in the manual of distribution .
the way system services can be started in these distribu@@ tions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary furnishing programs of these distribu@@ tions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are needed from the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply stop without notice when their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save it . you can either use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the username list . for editing the desired users or the desired group with a double clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog User - or group properties .
some card cards are only shown when you &apos;ve activated advanced system settings . only if you are using space options ( Qu@@ ota ) for users will be activated , on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards will appear , if shadow -@@ passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Unix systems are installed .
the card @-@ tab is displayed in case shadow -@@ passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD -@@ Unix .
this card card only appears if it is activated and initi@@ alized in case of a specified file system ( Qu@@ ota ) file ( Qu@@ ota ) file ( Qu@@ ota ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the plac@@ ings each in KB are :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected by means of the field of file system .
the card @-@ card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , which the user belongs , can be found in the field primary group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking those in the big box .
