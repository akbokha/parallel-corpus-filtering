<seg id="1">The module website can be translated in the & Conqueror; menu under extras page. select from the list below the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation are only very rudimentary. baboufish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make an important decisions, without the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the babelfish-page themselves, where you can insert either replaceable texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package includes various modules for & conqueror;. despite its small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & conqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & conqueror; and the built-in features can be found in the manual for & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & conqueror; select Settings Add-Set.... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard configuration modules from the package KDE; add-ons. please note that any more modules are available on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package kdebase, the & Konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in the & Conqueror; to the extras. then you can view the page, the & Konqueror; to crash, or the list of apostasy, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module module filter (also known as folder filter) in the & conqueror; menu bar under extras. using the module you can filter & conqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree in the & conqueror; to use, you can view the DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the right document. as a default, the display starts with the root index of the document, for example: documentelement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this worm node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; provides a further view of objects with the MIME type identifier / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The distinctive feature of & FSView; consists in revealing the folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is displayed by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the dimensions of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & FSView; the size of a folder or folder is, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; instruction command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; there is an entry in the tread representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation you have the right angles meaningful color and vents.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched on View mode, can be either depth for the slight detection of the shachts or the illustration of a different file level such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle may be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether enough space is to be displayed, or whether the surface of subordinate angles is to occur (whereby the surface errors can occur by restrictions when signs of the tread). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With display algorithms for Treemaps, the area should be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. if the Treats in & FSView; this target will not always be respected. it will be drawn to represent the tightening of the entries and that frames need space, which is then lost the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries will be left to the implementation. in this case, it is for the certifying and for avoiding placements through frames always beneficial the areas that are as the square. the best methods for this are lines, columns or recursive ignition.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal surface for an entry over the menu view. instead, a spacer pattern is drawn into the surface of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an independent entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction into the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for applying KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & Conqueror; menu under extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy to use camera code is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and select your photos directly in & digitised. of course each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digitization; together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitisone; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools. you can use them to review and correct your photos, commented on and correct. the editing abilities can be easily extended with KDE image plugins interface (manual) modules easily.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & B came; easy to use, it makes nozzle professional skills available. it works completely in 16-bit color foam and all available modules support the raw convertation by means of libraw, DNG export and ICC-colorations workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, e.g. on the camera or the lens over which you can search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all of the & KDE programmes, programmes are also very digitised; an open source project. that means, it is reliant on supporting the end users. therefore, they should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitization; tries to make the melting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you use in the program, the Help menu opens a page in the error report. if you use this linkages, your web browser opens a page in the error report. all required information is already registered here. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitisone; is a project which is supported by a community. that means that users and developers came to each other. if you have a regular user of & digitisone, then we would like to answer questions about other users of & scan; and hopefully soon we will answer questions of other users. in this mailing list, however, you should know this language therefore powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the text; homepage to visit News about shared versions and other information about & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved in & digitised, is the registration in the developer mailing list. guidance for the login in the developer mailing list of & And came;.</seg>
<seg id="64">If you start & review; for the first time you will be asked where you want to store your images and your database. you can simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file will be stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as much folder as you would like to add. & digitised, will also use as Albenbibliothek. settings</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk you can specify the top folder, the images containing as the base folder. no picture will be changed as an album. no picture will be changed when browsing the folder you will see a progress show like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitisone; durated recursively the librarian path in all its depth. you can exclude no subfolders, unless it iest into contagious folder. this allows you to add an extraordinate folder & digitization; take a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in my list will take no photos as symbols. you can change it by clicking any photo from the album and take this on the folder symbol. you will then be used as an album symbol. you will find more details about this in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up in & digitised; your digital camera set up. after that you should learn how to use My albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, so you can also handle. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help RohkameraSupport.</seg>
<seg id="72">As you set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh-Decodersettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera code is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and select your photos directly in & digitised. of course each medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digitization; together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) to data transmission. the connection can also be realized as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitised, uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are big files and transfer over the serial port, this connection has now become obsolete. & digitization; supports these cameras and automatically execute the images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support created to read the thumbnails of digitiously. the EXIF-support is not available in libgphotographs 2, you may have prelooked images potentially nothing or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in and digitization; is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitization;, KPhotoalbum, Showic and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it is also a user. your advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to complement a function when the changes occurred in & digitised, even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either switch the page with & LMB; remove or change in full screen mode with F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop your images everywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, through the horizontal separating line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file selection allows you to raise the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are displayed in the toolbar. thus, filtering is displayed on the filename only when this ind "tab is displayed also. which fields can be displayed in the dialog settings.</seg>

<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't need to know more than 1000 photos on your computer. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you don't want to save as well as in image files, you will definitely use very quick search and secure archiving to you with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you plan anything into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you'll have to decide whether other access to your photos will have to save whether you want to save them to a reserved drive, or click on a network work & etc; notice that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you are happy with this structure. holiday images can quickly be found via your location. if you organize enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work-flows, constants of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will then do not want to re-organise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes forklifts simple. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to store metadata in the setup page of the metadata in & digitised. this is certain that Exif- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently be able to select the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the menu Album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which to change? to them, and select a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you can now choose any photo keywords, captions and a review. of course you can choose the same attribute and put the value then. you start the best with the rating or the leaderboard. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let us know keywords, keywords, how to proceed with other programs often hot, or categories. all three are Synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import televised images from another source with embedded keywords, then the tree will insert the images to the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can simply be done by removing a sub-tree on one another. the modified keywords will be done by & digitiously; updated as it tracks the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata are overcut. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to allegations or comments, the third important tool to cataloze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to see most of your photos just to see, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to arrive as your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. out of distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical period of time is again present, you might even hear the silence. the caption thus has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at the title is perhaps more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key it is to transmit the importance of the viewer to help Him over the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect if it's the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitised, you can insert any number of text, in an international alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE can even export it to your wishes in the lettering and / or the title of the web gallery system. you'll have to tell the story for the openation period no second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? as you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now comes with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities offered by geolokization are already innumerable and become even stronger in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can export your travel to virtual. you can also export the photos at the entrance. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and means the practice to use copyrights to remove constraints on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, thus also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the furnishings page of & digitised; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for manufacturers and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support any commas yet semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author (synonym for Prevention): linked to the author. examples may be the working name of the photographer. examples for this can be title like: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer photographer. since this is a note on the author, it must be filled in this way.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who this photo offers. this must not necessarily be the author. if the photographer is listed for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a bearing photo, then here is the group / agency that offers the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this is no protection against abuse. anyone who has no protection against abuse. each one of which has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify the solution to this problem are digital watermark. for private individuals this is for the majority of your photos only of low interest. for professionals and half professionals, this protection is very important to this.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. &, in the near future such a module for stacking processing is available.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: turntables, turntables, rapids, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, life-time, temperature, data size, common superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have lost on the road or a fire. these type of losses are the same which can happen to you even in traditional paperphotos or negatives. in this section there are problems with the New Media as well.</seg>
<seg id="179">Roll Ontrack, the largest data recovery company of the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they must not be treated longer than a couple of years. of course you can also hold CDs and DVDs in archiving, which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your brass's room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you store good discs and good recording units, and use them in the right way. the best DVD recording units are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. so it turns out to select the right way.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very prone to mistake even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control environments. despite this massive protection, they need by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster this apparently causes miracles to CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but there are also similar applications the corrupt data of damaged floppies, hard disks, Flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to store the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost thresmal the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs, of course also applies to Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording on high quality media in a not propriated format. also read the media with a description, date & author Kennsigns and afterwards on a clean, dark dry and above animals protected place store. do not forget the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Flops reserve your statistics for yourself. your manufacturer guaranteed a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study on the troublesome of hard drives: discord study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: discs keep on the longest when you are operated in the temperate range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in lower temperament, these errors are not noticed. some of SMART determined errors announce the immediate forthcoming event. these are in particular Lesbiehler and relocators. the expected living-time amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the complete overlusts due to overvoltage. of course you also have data loss due to an electricity output before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices come not much, the devices with computer chips and high-speed processors are different. you can cause serious damage to your computer. so you can cause these anomalies, hardware alterations, remote motherboards and other defective. protect yourself from the inevitability which results in a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blackout is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbed a part of energy-heat and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. but remember that not every plug-in line contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should be careful that he meets the UL 1449 Standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning stroke and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should pay attention that also all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage support which also contain a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable-modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for travel.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system will protect against smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete loss. even a failure of a few seconds may result in loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Beside the protection from overvoltages, these devices may automatically make battery energy available when an electric loss occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and running the system. if you are buying a USV then you should be sure that they perform the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the included software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern you the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security in Stromness with the cost of avoiding this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be used for less than & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected. at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the correct configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives, however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to local data loss of most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general security solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo), and the photo community 23hq.com. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution online. the professional variant provides you more available, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data protection, Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically generated thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies is included in the offer a backup and an active memory. thus, they are desastersecure.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least the data integrations between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says if it occurred in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you have destroyed a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. nobody seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data track than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable network parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interference within the data flow. with normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle turnout at low level. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for Linux and Windows. please read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the Alpha Status. it uses the same protective mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% at the workplace systems. notebooks are already the proportion of theft 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most ignores. it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, travel cancellation, JFS and XFS in order to call the spread file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigating process at a sudden stop during surgery is higher and an indefinable status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human mistakes are the major benefits for data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards 10 megapixelsensors. even though this resolution is rather deteriorated for compact cameras and a high quality optics, the Optimum for Compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their border with 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">Thus, a 750GB hard disk drive you today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone other for data loss. therefore, your data is often affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous like the reinstall of your operating system, the exchange of plates or the size of hard disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash of lightning strikes you happiness when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster beats locally and destroyed a lot. forget aircraft: fire, water, electricity, children and theft can be dangerous enough for your data. they normally concern an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desastering is always a local storage. bring your backups up the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, you can save that of a day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files is to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at one time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential securing: backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two times: one of the complete locking and the last differential.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that has been changed since the last time. produces several moments. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made. this backup comes with a versioning system next with the exception that it is only flashed and not advanced.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer-scripts, rsync only the difference of files that were really changed. this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. every additional dilution should be done manually after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, views,..., usage of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider everything that is said today. unfortunately, there is no other way to do as a certain vigilance. unfortunately, there is no other option as a certain vigilance to be compatible. the less variations you have used in the past. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easily it is the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of declarations in this document. use or modify open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should review your library and when necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialized print for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have entered the scalability and put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record was detected by the system, but you do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& Dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb # Source is / dev / sdk. source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBet; # works with ext2.3, fatal 16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software more you can read it, then you can create them yourself. this task will be made from year to year easier.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. so you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard designed to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is verlustfree, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG can also be relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can save in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossoming free compression salt (deflates). a problem is however, that this format was adapted by many people. hence, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negatives file format is a licence-free and open raw format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and commits for the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already made available for DNG and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe its XML based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.

<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your shot, mostly in raw format, to archived. XMP also fits any problems with the link between metadata and image file, and as stated above, you should think whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin core Metadata initiative is an open organisation that supports itself for fully compatible online metadata standards, supporting a large range of operational purposes and business models. among DCMI, the work on a architecture and modelling, discussions and workshops, standard links and clarifying efforts to achieve a wider acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the ticket, or the scanner. as long as the images are on the cameredium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For hostile editing you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these were under circumstances cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in webgaleries, boiling in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitised. in the section adding a photos to an album you will find a description how you can already add photos, you can already add on your hard disk, but you can add many more advanced settings to importers of images to your Albendatensian database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitised, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the ad mode and turn it. a further description of this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, try to connect with your camera. if the connection is made, a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not appear pretense images. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file associated to each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the page properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays the file properties and photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer. please note that with some digital cameras do not provide all the information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata indicates the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer's remark, GPS etc. the picture. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digitization; or the image processing. please note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then select the selection from all. this loads the photos not deleted from her camera into one single album. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired with the standard optional optional methods of & KDE; once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download the selected. the button you will download it as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is new to download. these pictures have yet not been downloaded from & digitised. in this case, the new pictures have been marked with a star in the pre-showcase. if you choose this option, the new pictures will be downloaded, of course only the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the buttons, that you can download the target album, appears in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be displayed, as usual, displayed in the section My albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & B came; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the button Delete All deleted. if you just want to delete some delete, so you must first select it and delete them automatically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility to recover from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & KDE; they should be completely deleted before you delete it from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera. if you want to clear it from the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not especially meaningful names. the filenames are normally deleted once again, if you load photos of different diameters into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for the date-based subcategory. if you use this latter option automatically a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options during transmission opens three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the plate. the first two concern the data about the author in the standard authentication fields. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from EXIF data into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can fix date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use e.g. in the machining field the prefix photo -% Y-%% H:% M:% S. turn on the option date & time. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file names, you have the option to change the filename in small letters. or in case letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which is entered. for a photo used, below the name appears that the camera will be available in the Preview. your settings to rename will be stored and automatically used when opening the camera.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; all information on orientation of the camera will use to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't get this information, it leaves the button in the original orientation. if you want to switch the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window, use the toolbar and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>

<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case stores and digitisone; the photos directly on the target album. if you want to change it, you need to switch this option and select the option file based substangle at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download. then select Upload. select the file selector dialog & KDE; appears in which you can select the files uploaded to upload it. you can also select more than a file with the standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, queries & digitised, you where the images are to be loaded high. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select here the desired folder and click OK to start the uploading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position meant that can be displayed in longitude and latitude, and that can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to link an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten exactly where exactly the photo was taken, you can click with one click to open the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digitised, users who want to locate the location of photos, it is good to document the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, Sattelites and maps are supported. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera who has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work together with GPS recipients. either as a card module or through transmission of the data using a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be used with gpsman or gpsbabel. you must save these data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the module for geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract the data from pictures and from GPS and correlate it. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudes or other data, then you can use this script that works using the ExifTool of Phil Harvey. it uses the pre-marked coordinates that can be created e.g. of maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com are not showing European street cards. here are some European sites, at least in french, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitization; tries to give you as much control over his workflows as possible. to access these settings, you need to select Settings. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing. you place the default behavior of & digitization; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IPTC data fields. also with a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Autortitel is a synonym for Replacement: this field should be the professional marking of the photographer. this can be designations such as advertised photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description on the author, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field in order to specify the photo. this must not be the author as such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here since this is the image other & quot; analogous quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency the image should be enumerated here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC promotions store the data in the appropriate IPTC field. thus, the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only entered in the database of & digitization; this metadata also contains other programs and can be imported; imported them without any lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Images are synced as an inbuilt captions (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments that you have read to your photos with the images contained in the pictures. caution: in pictures that already contain signs, these are already written by the images found.</seg>

<seg id="292">The default settings allows you to reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & digitiously; can be opened on this page on the default values. however, some pictures have turned different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladle, you should use only on quick computers. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default the image processing a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can choose them here. you can switch the toolbar button to use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light colour in the image. these colors will be defined here. in the image processing, this picture Mode can be viewed with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the adjustment of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG-files. this operation is not reducing image quality, since PNG need a loss-free algorithm. the only effect is that the image data is more time for training and packaging. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressed you can switch the deflage salgts.m for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it reduces no influence on the image quality, since the deflate algorithm is overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the attitude of loss free JPEG-2000 files you can freely save it. even if you have written the loss of loss, the relationship between quality loss and file size was far better than with the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digitised, the image processing was just an image folder for photos. currently, it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default mode is that all green pixels are equal. if you use this option on odd lines with more sensitive to ultraviolet lines, this option generates a bit soft, eliminates this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option shows the picture a little soft, eliminated, but the 2x2 Gitterpattern with the VNG- or the AHD Quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white trimming of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white sliders is not set. default, it is a fixed color balance, which has been photographed on a white map that has been photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting will be supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the advantage of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images can get more details in the Spitzter. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the shredter, so the parts of your images are burned out, because of the inability of your camera emitting the edge of white to the edge. the setting colours produces some unusual results, as it indicates the edge-lichter in various roar. finally, you can attempt some parts of the missing information from the shredder to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast satified as green and red. & haw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red-proportions of the yet saturated blue pixel. of course this is a question how much color or whites you like.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be customized for each image separately.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminanzee according to your taste. you probably have to put it slightly higher than the default 1. but this can also be done later in the picture options of the & Editor; image processing should be made small in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial data sensor that have many cameras and which provides a matrix of colour pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-Interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& hav came; and Dcraw put you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Döw. it creates colored pieces on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-deviation of your lentils you can set the rotor and blue-correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color-visual correction, since it is carried out during the pipe converts.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translate the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & sounds; information such as the color information from a color room in the other to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Conduct issues if a picture is opened in the image processing, start / color administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile folder, setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & B came; examine this folder then during the Starts.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Colourself-design view is an alternative towards Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your images colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera body and model you're using. not all profiles are created in the same way. currently, there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain dytonholes or gamma-correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not apply to conversions at 16 bits depth. this means that you have to perform the color-tone itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your printer can print a smaller paint area than your camera and some colors therefore can be very saturated. this could be correct manually instead of leaving for the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite apparent which color profile is envisaged for what is envisaged. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is obviously inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expansion can be recognized the style for the purpose: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for neutrral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; Image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & KDE; images of images and image work. by adding this interface it is possible to support, many modules have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. select the one that you want to use, and these will then be downloaded as new entries in the menu window and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the Diashau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator inates the time between the captions, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other Angle fields turn off the metadata one or off, which are embedded at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatic Detection, which is tried to identify a camera connected to the computer. below are the port settings. currently you are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire-mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) - mass storage cameras from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / to specify on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitised, you need to connect the camera to your computer, connect it in the ad mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether and digitization; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camamodel and port manually. after you have set your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any name for your camera. it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirming dialog for the moving of &gt; pictures in the dustbin, you can preview the conversation of & sounds; when deleting a photo in an album. in the portions of deleting a photo and deleting a album you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be tacitly used by & digitised, when you use the option changes in the right side bar without any queries. otherwise, you will need to make changes to the button changes.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digitization; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correction and improvement. image processing can be started by a click with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of preview and editing ads.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitised. so you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the section portrait.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file name, magnifying factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The machining functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file saved or the button save from the toolbar. please note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the photo.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly have a copy of your image before you change it. this lets you perform with file saved.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you do not have saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the menu file recovery or use the button The button Remanufacture of image processing restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have performed at the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of the image processing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undone by selecting the editing process or to be restored by selecting machining back from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to return, and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to reconnect.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; over the back-to or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are also reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar. if you have any changes on the current photo, you will ask if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can click in the photo and zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the reverse menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">Viewing full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come into the normal view, in which you do not want to use the toolbar button. normally, you can also change this in the setup dialog from & digitised. you can view this from the & C; main window. see the section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select image file image and get the default & KDE; print dialog. you can customize settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases. whole image pages can be printed from your choice. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu Album Exportees printers. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitization; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same side bar is available without the navigation panel, also in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple-aches Click on the same tab allow the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the protectionery view, you can insert captions with unlimited size or insert. notice the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means that all special characters are allowed in the EXIFT and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be truncated according to 2000 characters and special characters are shaped. if you want to use the IPTC label in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented that you have commented on either the button or simply change the next picture, the signs will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the apply-button there is one button More. with this you can write more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also use the metadata in the files. however, this will always be done if you have selected a metadata default that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single click on the side bar or with the keyboard shortcut + 0... 5. to evaluate several pictures at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. encoding is followed by the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword and a selection box with the previously used in this & digious keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is adjusted dynamically to the desired search word. you can quickly limit the number of ways in finding a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have lots of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief in the input of keywords in a picture series. if you entered different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markers of the corresponding checkboxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">When multiple images are selected in the main view, and select a keyword in the keyword, it will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page header section is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally the left side bar will be used with their album, - Datum-, keywords, and viewpoints. if in addition, one or more keyword filter is used from the right, only the cutting-quantity of these two is displayed. all provided keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag keywords and drop them. suppose you have selected several images in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put on the selection. subsequently, a dialog you ask if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper case, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter stands on no keywords, which sets the amount to three pictures. they were chosen with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword-tree was drawn to the selection and filed there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. you can also be turned aside in settings various settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and have created and determine that it should be one or be, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, which is looked for in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string, which is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set a Extended search on all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the tick-field at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a colorless workflow, the colors that from your camera or scanner can have a predictable variance from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors available on your monitor those from your camera or scanner, and you may publish the colors you print or publish in the web that are coming from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, then everyone wants to know which buttons it must push for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions about color management. additionally, you will have links with further information allow your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image is fulfilled all six below criteria then you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color foam. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image rates are by email or the Web, where sRGB of de facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everybody so easy, why should one use another color room and thus have to worry about paint noise?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional reproduction of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe region, and colours in the sRGB color room, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color trees, please visit Bruce Lindblooms and click info and then click Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Must I kallible my monitor if I have decided to work only in sRGB color room?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB color piece or not, you have to work your monitor callicky, since sRGB it is proceeding out of the circle. if you work as a color foam of sRGB, then you need to either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, using a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, comparing the same and contrast from the menu corrigidly Automatic correction is automatically trying out of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which best works on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method will scale the luminance over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its colour shaded. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparisons: this method adjusts the illuminates of the colors of the selected image so that the histogram of the integer can be as shallow as possible. sometimes, the same very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only the rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles with a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue-channel. they determined the dark and bright border-tones and adjusted the red, green and blue channels on the complete histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in hussed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white tricked away from & digitised; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-coated of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-straight correction is somewhat limited as there is a color room with 8-bit per color. if you can perform too far from original image, areas with overexposure can occur, which is in the 16-bit mode, so your ways to correction is better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salmtuce of the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym is protected. you start it via the menu items white-like of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The curtain can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target audience. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original protein, then it is enough to click the bottom window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminanz of the pixel, under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above, a histogram is displayed, as soon as you change a parameter. this histgram is very helpful, even in well illuminated pictures, most pixels very small Luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shade of adjusting can you improve the shots of your photos or also download it.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature Pipette. click on this button and then click anywhere on the thumbnail to use the color temperature of the whiteboard. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white section with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The excess indicator indicator increases the colors when more than a colour channel of the pixel is overexposed.. you will display the combined result in the white-channel. this is shown in the preview of a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store exactly this. each adjustment of the whiteboard you have set, you can save it into a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets presupposes all filtervalues back to its standard values and the associated neutral whitefit. note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set here the codiles for each colour channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality pictures. this coding requires also more disk space, calculating time and stands just for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the helmets. a detailed instructions for use of color profiles can be found in the chapter coloradministration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors key correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time. this is helpful to make use of it for multiple photos. this is helpful when your camera or scanner always need the same correction and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for a sound-correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradient in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitization; tool color effects provides you with four color effects, a solar output effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a bell filter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar interpolarization, also called Sabatians, a effect of the arose. the colored, dark areas sheltered the delicate photopapier of the additional light. this had the effect that the brightest areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to fine this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity control the solar organization. with approximately 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. another increase finally produces a negative image that is not to be seen on photopiier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar effects. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the applied intensity is at 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid-Filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation that he makes a stronger contrasting effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvet offers very saturated color with daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a film of choice for nature photography. Velvias strongly saturated color, but also some photographs, especially those of which are barely landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">Neonfilter simulates neonlight to the contrasting. the parameter levels controlled the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlichts. with large pictures the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color contrasting of your photos with the tools in the menu. all your Justiations can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo of bad light conditions, you can get the inverted problem: a great choice to reduce the saturation instead of raising it. all changes that you can carry out you can preview in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple lamp volume / contrast / gamma the tool is a key correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need for the use described in this tool only the area of shale. concrete the three shooting below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intensity, a dustogram, the active channel or of the selected range. under graphs are three shooting into the entered and can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to use the operation is to postpone the regulator and to take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. preview is dynamically based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selective box can be set, whether the Histogram comes with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera is often the linear representation of a single column. in this case, the logistic Histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top for the dark tones, the mean for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle notes, often gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preimage of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is one button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of output values can be used for example, to create a hidden picture as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and recharged later on it will use the Gimp format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three hupaces, the input values will automatically be replicated for all shade, means and Sundays. activate the original pipette that you want to use and click the thumbnails of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminanzchannels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option of overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect shown only in the Preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target picture is displayed. the Preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modify Channel: this selection box allows the channel to enter the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and one logarithmic view. for images included with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of sensuous mode. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode produces a wide beams. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move e.g. a board down to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones with darker's output files are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original photos is to see a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change the original value. create a dot on this line and move it up and down until the value is judicial to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and shop: with these buttons, you can make exactly this. each bend which you can create can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format is used for Gimp.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three color paces settings automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, middle and Sundays. activate the color ppipette that you want to use and click the original image for the rotor, green, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option of overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the result displayed only in the Preview and it's no effect to be seen at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo which was corrected in the Luminanzcanal. shadow and sunny tones were set with the shade of the paint and applied to the curves (1) and the corrective (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digitiy; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly-developed tool to mix the shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel optional box you can select the color for the pistogram: this gives you a first hint of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the goal image has a red marker. if you stand this in the picture a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you modify Luminanz, because the channel mixer then is DAS tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrom, the reduction of a color leads to a visible rustling of color, which comes from the color channel, and their smoking patterns in every channel looks different. if that is the case you can improve your monochrom conversion thus in which you will reduce the color first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storing as well as loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender attitude allows you to save it for later and then load. the file format is multi-channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option of overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect shown only in the Preview and it's no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture newly opened in the blue channel. the option Luminanz is enabled. the original picture is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / White photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / White is a working step, as colour images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rollment profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with green linsenfilter. this looks good at all the scene images and fits particularly well with portraits of the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfilmed: simulates a black / white film exposure with a oracle linsenfilter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokine (tm) Oranfilmed.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red linsenfilter. this creates a dramatic sky-effects and can simulate moonies at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokine (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Gel filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color-correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 Cokin (tm) Gelbfilter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones while he added a bit coldness in the shading tree. this is very similar to the process of failure of a printing and redevelopment in a septic onator. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digious; tool texture can apply you to apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it's a color picture or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the Stich of an old master, a pop kind Portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall. the menu entry picture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift that parameter to the right raises the semblance of the depth or three-dimensionality of texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper collection effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digitization; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep its attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the eye eye. under picture frames the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you place the desired cream type for your image. thoroughly round the picture with a colored line, Niepce umranged it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button-effect and decoration adds an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percentage. the value area for width is 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the frame decayed goal is greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image on any point. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with your mouse. use text instrument, orientation, color from the color room and the character set with its characteristics as you need it. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be. for the end you simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-sighted background. already, the picture is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any attitude that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press the button "OK." after the picture was saved, the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">When inserting the tool template, you can apply a template via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image painting can be used in the image processing can be used to specify scencils over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format, and should add with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of the template, so you simply send an e-mail in English to die & scan; mailing list Setting-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">When you use this tool for the first time, you have to put your template folder with the button basic folder in dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template file. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root-folder for the stencil has been set, a building view, which reflects the folder structure of the template's folder, the selection of a folder updates the thumbnails of the stencil.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the Preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is magnified the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resins: this button resized the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must resp the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image, then the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumbsize.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitization; provides three different tool to acuteness. each one of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpen is a traditional tool to sharpening. it is very fast and simple, however, especially in dark areas, granular images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture sharper. actually, it works rather psychovisual Dunst. you can use it to get atmospheric Dunst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Reviewing is perhaps the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require a correction of the sharpness. this in turn leads to a common color to a color point. this also leads to sharp edges a little blur. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more slowing than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG-pictures frequently a camera has been applied to internal acuteness. images in the raw format on the contrary must always be processed during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner turn a tightening filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable them, you get in control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by getting a photo with the sharpening value chain. you can call the menu entry into Corrigidity.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general the need to focus on a picture the tool refocus on. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for acuteness.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to record the picture a little soft, is much easier than it sharpen. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry variable and experiment some with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blur masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview will help edit the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values will produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount will reinforce the effect. if you make the blur mask too strongly, smoke and the impression of grats are in the vicinity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage being added between the original and the pictured image one that is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The tail-value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference. you can thus define a minimum difference to the edges of the filter. this way, areas with a soft change between the tones of sharpen and therefore flaw in facial, celesticks and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blur masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blur masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a tail value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitization; tool refocussing is focused on an image by enhancing the edge of the field. it used the copyrighted design algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to raise a picture. it is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. you can easily run it from the menu by calling colors refocusing in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular fission works much better than the Gauß'sche fission. the Gauß'sche fission has a very long tail, which is leading to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß'schen fission is influenced in most cases, even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular acuteness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should result 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred then but to halo.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the tougher effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoker filters: an increase in the smoking filters can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the smoke filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will make the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's edge. in most cases, you should not use this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may need to also increase the correlation and / or the smoke filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, an increase of the matrix size can have good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular edge or the gauß'schen field. note that the module is very slow if you choose large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will then be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cutting, color and Intosh corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture in any other way. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes which are not immediately visible are left unenjoyable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you have pictures read and compress, & eg; when JPEG, you should use the module to uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results as acuteness. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood as acuteness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking must always generate artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of tougher filters. virtually, the result of the FIR Viennas is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this picture was made using an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of the field correction in digital photos, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothing puts the blur of the area which was knocked out to generate a natural pair of pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink duct enables a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool misaligning is one of the most advanced tools to not remove desired artifacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The invention algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presettings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a evenly believer over the picture. a value of 0.9 should therefore receive details so that no depth is necessary. please note that the detailed specification shall always be subordinated to the direction of direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Right-dependent Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes in all directions while a value is near to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film-grains or CCD spacers will generate a high value to wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">[0, 500] This sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value perfectly to the degree of smoking in your picture.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: returns how often the algorithm is going through. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-cutting da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha small selected, there should also be small selected. so make sure that small angles have a long run time. so you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral part [0,1, 10]: integrated stepper cent in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low. it doubles the running time. we therefore recommend it to allow it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store exactly this. every setting of image errors can be corrected to a text file and recharged later on.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correct image errors is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with small artifacts. the module is made on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground, that is caused by a bad movie storage during the trip (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyright algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable images available to remove stains and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens, to remove. it can also be used to remove sensors from the camera or motions; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensors of digital cameras, you can read them in English this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you just need the sub-window details and the sub-window advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image. the image indicated by the radius is moving about the image and the color in it is saved and therefore minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value raises the pixel up to the front. if it is lifted you will change the edges filter. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer be preserved and rustle or lubrication occurs once again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not occur the entire noise or smoke-tips can occur. put it on a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the Glatiation process controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color-tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the Glatiation process controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are amplified to increase. however, he also consumed the shadow ranges.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the bending radius. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is reacted when it is too high can occur. if he is on his minimum, noise and phasenjitter can occur at the edges. it can remove noise and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction that you have set can be saved into the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrective with (2). the noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes, an image is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to record the picture a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool for soft sign with the menu entry into specifies differently and experiment with the smoothing. the window display on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographic record.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts from your images. it is very well adjusted to emerge in digital, original or retroactively digitised images, to remove. the smoothing is done along the image contours and thus receives the content as it is also the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for colour and text composition. the text composition is carried out with another tool, the image editor, carried out. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franche and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a loss of compression compression, he produces some compression & quot; arteartquot; - small standards that are shown in uncompressed image. this attitude should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and recharged later on.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load for itself. hence, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-shaped rustle.. The module is applied to a black and white photo recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film granularity on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected one under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures was reduced to an old color photo recorded with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the Scannerlighting and the photopapier. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitisone; tool hotbed permits the hotbed of photos which were created with a CCD camera, eight were used to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are especially in high-quality raw-mode photos a problem because many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and 'quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with an darkest substitution method. there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to enter the dark picture directly in the port to detect new hot or bright pixel by the CCD.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should upload the dark picture to the corrected picture. note that the wizard shows the last darkest picture and this automatically loads back to the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image and the preview will help you correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are taken out in all processes.</seg>
<seg id="560">Choose an area around the defective pixels on the Preview and see the results of the filter. choose the best filter method to interpolling these pixel poles. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Thirsty: there is an average of the neighboring pixels. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixels are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pixelblock are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square turns (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cuban: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-kubische surface (2-dim) or a group of kubine curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotspot correction on a color photo, from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was enlarged by 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; vignetting error is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Expansive objective, especially the central and large photo-format, can often illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. teleobjective show under circumstances also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But he also has cons. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. vastness object should also use with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unsharpening effects arise through motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the great popularity of today's film and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center@-@ filter by using a equivalency transformation in a raw material that is applied without this filter. the tool of vignetting is applied to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers you can control the Vignetting-correction filters and with three further exposing the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the largest density the filter. the default density is 2,0, which compensate an optical filter with a aperture adjustment of 1, or randomly to compensate the density to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchthickness, contrast and gamma-settings: the image of an image with the vignetting error reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to readjust the exposure of the target audience with these options. the regulator will provide you only positive values as you just need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re-tuning of the target audience, so leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma with zero and use the gradient option from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting error in an image applied. the original image (1) shows the correcting image in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminance and contrast-correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitisation; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second gradient covers the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the conave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar graffing effect, flacht on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grades can be corrected the remote corners opposite to the second gradient. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second grader. with negative values, tons of valves can be corrected and positive values cocized distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth gradient. this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameter has the inverted sign of the parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scalates the image size and thus leads to correction first gradient. negative values increase during positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog box with a preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons and medium-shaped correction should be performed prior to all trimming or size changes. in case you have to cut a picture anew and then perform a tons-shaped correction, the effect would be the apparent of the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal relief line. move it into an important place like e.g. the seashore or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can fix the tons / kcratic distortion using the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you have a coloscious distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can transform them with the cutting tool in the menu transforming cutting from image processing or through the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images, the tons-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motives such as shots from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the GimpGuru.org web page within this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the Preview, you can set two parameters to simulate film granularity and filmsensitivity (ISO). enable the granular texture of a high-sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green lawns are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colors are misused to reproduce infra film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white-photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effects applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original picture is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a type of aura in the shredder.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digitization; filter diagrams are an easy to use tool to reproduce film-grains on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of movies, the manufacturer mix major disc liqueur of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grading effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loosening of daily life. in case you want this special, gallery-like, street photography, granular sight specially in your monochrome photos, so you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the basins. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required to be adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of screening effects on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitised; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyrighted material protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to affect this effect. the top selects the pinch size between one and five. thicker brush are suitable for big pictures. smoked controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the singularity.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is characterized by the (1) and the irworked is marked with the (2). padding size for this 640 pixels big image is 1 and smoked 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digitisone; filter coal-drawing used color - and Intensity gradient to create a cavities in the drawing. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to create you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value-range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower the contrast (glow).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon pass filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the performance value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitization; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stacked in wax. it uses a copyright algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitization; filter engraving is a fast tool to resume your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondarily landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of filtration. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: shares the image in cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glassy blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analog to the wavelblocks 1 will distorted the image here in a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an art work by means of blurred effects. it uses the copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wipes the image along sternfoal lines that go from a center. this simulates the blur a zoomed camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial discord: blurring the image by rotation of the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal of removal: wipes the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens. the object seems to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blissors: wipes the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening harness: wit the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Scarring: blurring the image by random variation of pixels and simulates the blur of any random camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and wipes this without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The rain drops are a cute little tool to make rain drops in your picture. thus it gives natural your images a nasses appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the trops. since the droplet size is not automatically growing with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. Fischaugen changes the optic effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & scan; image processing a field free of rain drops. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face, which should remain free. if you start the filter rain drops in the area, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drops. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it by mirrors or rotating in the right orientation. the tools can be found in the menu transform or transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo for a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to resist is simple. the big question is how can you hold an image inflating and the details sharply? how can you find the missing information again? how can one find the missing information again? how can one find the missing information again? how can one find the missing information again? try it here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and enter the target values. dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitization; used a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio follows: if this adjustment is activated, when entering the new size the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is needed, as it is difficult to appreciate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as well as store will be exactly used. each plug-in for photo can be saved as a text file and recharged later on.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it makes but it can still take a very long and a high CPU load for itself. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflatable, by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). preview (2) is the result of linear standard enhancement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a commonly performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to compile a picture. you simply need to cut a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you leave the mouse button again the area of photos will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can drag the size of the to cut area by clicking on the corners of the rectangle by pressing it simply by clicking the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting section, use the button The addition-button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save File Save File Save as a file to save the newly used photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high format, the higher value of height and width is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you can use centimeters, inch or any other physical size. you can e.g. see a list of traditional sizes for photopiards and their aspect ratios.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons are automatically horizontal or vertically to centre.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in a dialog you can set up with the Max. relationship button the area for cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool, these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are reflected in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of contraction help allow yourself to engage in help so that you can put your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic sub-forms are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-party, harmonic triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle in a similarly harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Age: the golden center is a division taking over various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the blurls of a sunflower. it dives in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have already used the ancient Egyptians and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos put together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21, 21 and etc; from where every number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two preceding figures. the present divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that is usually follows as visually harmoniously.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre makes liquid lines available when you put an image together. these help will be enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring your aim to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third-party, the golden spiral generates a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the spectator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called Golden angles. it should be used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this one can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also guided by the above listed golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are no similar triangles. diagonal to place these lines can place a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame and create an effect of by professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image film at one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic dividing.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image for any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it happens easily that you're not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are around a corner. you can fix this with the & scan; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose free rotation and tuning the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slate angle. the values on that sliding are specified in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider back to 0 degree. preview the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the module provides free rotation a horizontal and a vertical line available. move the mouse cursor in the image preview for the two lines. after you have moved it via an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to fix it is the function transforming it out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatically cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. notice the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivan transformations are carried out by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas that are created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas that were created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right up: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adjustment of the perspective the image will be a bit wasted. for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have attached the perspective, you get unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to mention this is the picture with transform cutting out of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallel ram. you can start this module about transcendlessly.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scrolling your picture by using the horizontal angles and the vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time. preview the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shot, the picture becomes a bit wisely. for a single ring this effect is usually neglected, but two types of producing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the closing the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is the image with transform cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitization; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compiling have been compiling. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats available on their system. but you will always be JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& Editor, only files in formats which knows. this happens through the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, it will be displayed, and select this list of file extensions that can be expanded. in the section configuration you will find further information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format used format. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digitization; supports both formats.</seg>

PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is indicated below. the speed of the image is specified below, below. a lower value creates a very sudden, a high level of a very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and path of the created file you can set under name of MPEG-output file. keep in mind the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file using the name of the audio source file, then this will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can now move with the button code to drink the production of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to drink a coffee and enjoy the dippers once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MypegTools and ImageMagick Packages to the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper along with standard photography sizes. the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with image processing Gimp. this is e.g. sensible to improve your or using the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original theme of Him is: expect from dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera body. sometimes you get better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window will appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the white, brightness and red / blue amplifier. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG Conversion can be selected for you to use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the verlustfree LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are going to process your images frequently or you later use later, you should not choose the JPEG format since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that are included in the raw file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion button to start converting the conversion. if you want to cancel this process again, so you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert various images at once. use this mode so if you are sure, e.g. by testing in a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, here you have the possibility to overwrite the existing file. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion progress is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, start-up number and timestamp of the one.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge. to this end, four types of images are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non-proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed during this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation preparation: prepares the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photopapiers. the target picture, including background size, size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the disappearing images before. further images can be drawn on the list of the images to be displayed and stored there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images can be shown with the images you selected. over the button images you can add additional pictures with a file selector dialog. for the last selected image will be a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list and add it to the list of the pictures to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images, the selected images will be removed from the list of the images to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all pictures you can open with the button OK the new message window of your e-mail client. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you selected have already been attached to the appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of the e-mail address. it may possibly send a good idea several mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration is stored and every time again uses until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird so you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must install the GMailAgent on your computer in advance. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file you will add the comments to the images in a text file and attached the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Images File Format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among the lossoming free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under pictures file format and are the original files in the JPEG format, then the original Exifdata are added to the appearing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is finished, the window will not automatically closed down to you to view the status messages, looking for errors. your e-mail program will start automatically at the end. with the button Close you can shout this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diashau you will have a window with questions like you want to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation will use very elegant image transfers using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, since otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file names show that the filename can display images in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop. you can manually add them to Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly choose that the images are shown in a random order. so it will not be used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between images can be set between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard. the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transfer effect. you should so check this before you show the presentation your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose. randomly choose another effect in each transition between images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the diaschau you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn you off.</seg>
<seg id="893">Using this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left side of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under KDE-Imaging @ cde.org. note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set up a picture as a background image for the surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module combines the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as the background for your KDE surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can use with & kphotoalbum; through this browses, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image are now available in every group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories, for which you have entered information when you have given your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course look at the current thumbnails. in the following each one is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, changes the browser view. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of pictures shown from a few thousand images to a couple of individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the individuals, places and other settings, you can preview with thumbnails to view the images of your impact.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. however, you can save with & kphotoalbum; however for each person a separate preview image, This of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined themselves. see for this the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button that you want to use right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can use the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display for example symbols with pictures of people and simultaneously a list of keywords (if you don't have appropriate images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You have to specify yourself, which is to be displayed for each individual person. to view this, you'll have to view the picture Ansieve window (in closer) and in the context menu you can select the picture for the corresponding person. in the Ansieve window you can customize the picture factor to your preferences and to select which part of the image should be displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you visit the entry entry in the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for the fixed image properties. this dialog you can look at the picture once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field of lettering or description, you can also enter a date that will be searched for; the date may be either a part of the product date, so for example in 1971, or the complete date. you can also use an area of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images after certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, though not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals but rather try out the functions, you have the following alternatives to this guide:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and watch the Quick Start, the Screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start the demo album; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select in the menu Help menu entries. as a result, some example-images can be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, please find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different periods of time. each body then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units of months, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline you can use in the following ways (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the Preview button) and also displays the timeline always the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in the Preview View.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps, drag. if you select an area, you will be displayed in the Preview View only images of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated into & kphotoalbum; integrated version which allows you to create using the menu of HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you will need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following each area is exactly described.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the blicks and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. nutritional information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed on the HTML pages. for example, that all pictures of a party are obvious. please note that & kphotoalbum; currently all pictures are exported. you can not use this attitude to hide certain images from certain point of view.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most of the settings are clear why not specifically stated on this.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below you can set different resolutions for images below. by doing so, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images to download the resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The spectator of your site can change the resolution at any time. so he can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, as well. if he wants to display a picture larger he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folders and the URL that your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select all your HTML files and select a new subfolder for all your HTML files.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. you can select either a folder or a KDE supported protocol for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all available for viewers. if you have created a web browser for the basic folder. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final target folder you'll need to manually copy them manually. to enable the import function, see correctly, you must specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of current files, but the basic folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described, all three are related to basic folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name will define you in your output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you're on a family business, a meeting at the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have already paid a lot of time to contemplate the images, then you have to write with & kphotoalbum; this work will not even make.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image features are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kin files, internal and external. you differ in it if the images are stored in the file or if in the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage is to store all pictures together and that file can be distributed so independently. the obvious disadvantage is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the menu file or create together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file with an HTML file, this will create an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two ways. first the corresponding images are not found, so the pictures of the URL you are specified when creating HTML files. this is of course only possible if you created your .kin file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog will be described for exporting images that can be accessed via the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is to act in internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the Manual unplug near the .kim file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically copy it to the .kim file copy copied & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it's usually not worth the files to compress. if you want to do so, just choose the option export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you want to send your friends pictures, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by adding for example that every picture is at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Import... select, & photophotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for Imported consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import them, in which folder to import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you personalize the category persons of the to imported file personer (if you are a Dane) while this category is in case of your database persons. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box, which are to be imported into the categories of the to imported file and what categories that are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to import the categories of the selected file with the categories of your present database. an example of this can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be simple to browse and look at: when you look at pictures, one would often want to see images within different pictured groups & mdash; if you want to see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend to it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook, you will find the different steps from (1) to locate information about your pictures, over (2) searching and reputation, up to (3) advanced themes and adaptability.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for managing your images. but it was expanded and today it also takes your videos. at many places in this handbook will be talked about paintings, but often it also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of her pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal locking tools, just copy on a floppy disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your images are stored and uses it automatically. if you want to read a different database in & kphotoalbum; in case you have a different folder tree with pictures, you can launch a different folder tree; with the option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... you reach a window where you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can invoke settings and view the options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help available that you can call by a keypress on the F1 key and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can define for each picture of different properties, e.g. people, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog, which is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already mentioned. in the dialog options you can set up complete members groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group, rather than explained in a group membership.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of settings for you to set up the membership groups, you can choose the category. with the above listed selection list, you can select the category with the current category and in the right a list of categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his module with other graphic applications such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin interface. nutritional information on this can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the menu modules. the modules can be called and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules can be used together with multiple applications, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; demo database can always be tested first with the demo database before committing them to your own pictures. you can either call the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules on KIPI are very different, thus allowing it to be that some modules with & cold album; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & cold album; and other applications, which also use KIPI is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this type of order does not support, simulates it for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & acoustic album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulated & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture shows at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album has to record & kphotoalbum; the modules also has a list of albums. here goes down & photophotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category individuals, so do not matter if you were selected to view it and pass this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog, and select in the modules that are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a startup screen once you start & photo album; with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are accustomed to it from any other KDE application, take a look at the top of a menu, and a toolbar. at the moment we don't see any information about your pictures. in the section we will return to this window, now click on the pictures to show you an overview with all the existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to see any picture with notes. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, etc. you can set any picture either separately or for a larger number of images. if for example on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments may be used for searches and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the inbuilt viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In a look at three lists using a text field by choosing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotographies; as you will always use them again if you submit information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shifting of images within the list: if you have a family celebration, and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are depicted, you can make sure that the names used up are moved upwards to find people faster and be assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to list a alphabetical list, click on the icon for sorting by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen notes to each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add these pictures with annotations. in this case simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have added several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item for multiple entries at a time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window in the USA as a survey. to show you that it is a survey, a special symbol is shown.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new superstructure or subcategory. in addition, you can also take an entry into a category and drop there to make this one subcategory this entry. attention, this assumes that you just sort out your categories alphabetically. see it.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the component, by clicking the glue that form the edge of the frame, click on it. you can also make your own window as well as drag it outside of the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings that you have the option to store the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to see this window later, use the button options... and then window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in your browser, you get an overview with previews of the currently selected images, or any images if you have no filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will be displayed in the picture code. if you don't have a window opened with an image open, a new ad line will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete or select either the Remove button or select in the menu Edit selection. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use with & kphotoalbum; for example images can also be stored on your hard drive. of course you have to record the pictures somewhere, so you can record the images in the database index. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary photos can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper hand is cut off, are not saved on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9 there are the thumbnails, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can not view these images with the image concerned.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see this feature, you need to copy files from the folders and copy again. & kphotoalbum; support it until now, not you want to avoid the inserting of the relevant CD. if you would like to avoid any hassles of your pictures, please purchase a larger drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, you can use the pictures so that you can see for others inaccessible and click on Recreviewing View inside the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also see all the pictures that can see your little sister, conserve, and select the menu item everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you set up which images are hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, allowing them to get locked out. if you want to see the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be entered into the unlock of images. to set up this password, simply select a password in the menu Privacy Policy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. for example, everyone can access the file index.xml, to read the password as unencrypted text or delete. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & acoustic album; not very familiar to do the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you will spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and hours over hours to describe you is of course that you want to look at some point. for this reason, & kphotoalbum has a picture _ and video visuals. you can preview them from the preview, as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in it. of course he shows the image, but additional all the information you have to enter into the picture, such as who is in the image, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can easily drag and drop them somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether all of these options are displayed according to a right-click on the viewer. you can see the right-click menu click below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on the browser, see the appropriate entries to this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you were selected from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and then use the buttons image high and image below. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these features can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as diaschau. then a new image loads it by pressing the Strg button and Plus or Minus press. started and stopped, the slides through the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the entry button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can click into the picture and pull out to zoom. with the mouse simply put a rectangle. with the minus button you can slip again the Plus button zoomt in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the picture will not be zoomed. with the equalization key puts the zoom, so that every pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Notice that the only zoomoperations work with videos that work in and out with the Plus- and the key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the filming from the context menu you can rotate the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current picture with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you'll find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can watch it off and open configuration dialog from the picture to copy this name. you'll perhaps prefer to highlight the picture and see further pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and select it as good or bad as you look at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For both examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to show pictures with characteristics while watching them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. in a look at a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have placed features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, then simply provide all at once with annotations. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the thumbnail. if you want to view categories in Dre thumbnail, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letters for the feature, after the picture was chosen. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on an image. for this case allows you to paint & photo album; in the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted will not be saved with the image but in the database. on the way you can make your painted later on.</seg>
<seg id="1011">You can see an image on the painted tree. in order to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; just turn on the image from the context menu. to finish the mast, you simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you must not control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation on & Povray you should have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following listing menu ends, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With Delete either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can select previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changing properties, click on to apply these changes. do you have invalid values, a message with a fault description will be displayed. then you can use the input decker right again and then click on to apply changes to disrupting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user's documentation in the interior dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit an texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the peculiarity view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the peculiarity view and a small example of the scene will have been selected using the chosen texture, even if you want a subordinate element. if you want just one part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross them locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a lens-level. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects will only then be shown when they are selected or their visualization level smaller or equal in the toolbar of the sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window-order as a default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default window procedure or if you need a different arrangement, you can adjust them to any number. you can also save several shutters and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a present view, drag the start to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the start to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to relate multiple opinions to each other, you prefer the starting point in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cartoons-page into the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window-order are hoist views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view out of anchoring, drag the start to the desktop or click on the little left at the top left arrow in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the toolbar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for each type of views. new views are sounding, you can anchor them on any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can save you with window shutters... save it. a dialog displays that you can store the window-order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can renders it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rename the current scene click on the icon Rendering The Symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to set a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render settings in the toolbar or menu view Render modes... choose the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that allows the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card card size you can enter the width and height of the straight image. if you want just a small area of the image, select the cross-box subsection and enter the image-section for renders into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In a combination field quality, you can select the properties that uses & Povray; for rendering it from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the Render-properties can be found in the user Guide & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rounded with just one ray per pixels you can create various mistakes. these images often have a Moirè sample or stud effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is adapted again and adaptive because every pixel depends on again and adaptive because the recurring depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray goes a ray per pixel. if you adjust the difference between the shades of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth to 4, a grid of 4x4 added points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -B 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between dyes the predefined threshold, then the pixels being divided into 4 subpixels that are individually followed and checked for further classification. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the lowering.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the production of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to charge a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card, you can adjust if the alpha channel is to be calculated by POV-Ray. an pixels is then transparent when the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray. if & Povray opens, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; select the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the complete command of & Povray; if at Importing messages or warnings, a dialogue window shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawkin and / / * PMRawend.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the code text for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor, simply highlight the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and insertion into & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler is called a scene. usually this Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the Credentials View, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation shown here. set the path to your documentation and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type identifier.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-catch of the points on the grid menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifting, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values arise an accurate wire model and thus a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detailed level for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the detailed instructions for extended projections, all the wire model views are further divided, if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projection. this property results in a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you candid a wall, a wall is depicted behind the objects. the wall is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross soil will cross the ground below the objects. the ground is displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate cantateboat, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling value can be set. precise information about the parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to change existing shutters or create new window assignments. in the window assignments will be explained as you can create window assignments and save it.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combinational field standard window image: displays all existing window assignments. & kpovmodeler; used the selected window-order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of available shutters shows all existing window assignments. a new arrangement can be set up with the button Add and delete a selected order using the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window of window is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all views for the chosen window assignment. new views can be set with the button Add and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with ounces anchor the window below the existing window, with card card, you get a card card view together with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you as a result only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust the camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark, and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler, following the following window assemblies:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow these instructions, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate. in particular, note that in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry containing the name camera. if they click on it, you see the content of the viewing properties, in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's documentation to & Povray you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is later instructions reserved, but note that the camera is in view of control points, with which you can change the waypoint of the camera. simply click on a check point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you apply the button or press Enter, the wire model views and the object-tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a quader (inserting body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an enclosed method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler: actually offers an easier way. you can use an infinite level as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button or paste the button. in the object-tree the new name will be shown immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the level as well as at the moment only as a limited time frame. if you turn the scene, the plane stretched out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can click on the icon on the ground. in this case you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should postpone the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, so that you can get to know some of these parameters. select shifting and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the floor to stop its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog will open in which you can choose to be inserted in the object. you can change the name in the object-tree (name = bottom pigments), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of pigments only shows a matt black material because you need settings for pigments yet. therefore, keep in mind that you can review the look of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the easiest way now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't want to preview color on Quader and Ball, just click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is right now. if you put your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you have to do. here are other settings necessary. in the color list you have to insert two new attributes. then select this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the chessboard list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in the object-tree everyesmal and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to run, since you have understood the fundamental working methods of & kpovmodeler: the ball can just be as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the button paste or the button to press) so the ball has float over the floor as you have moved the floor to a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering results now a strange result: as already seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put in the following step an appropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material now. as already in the ground, you give the ball a pigment as a colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First sub-object and change the name for example in the sphere of pigments. click Ball pigment, select then select and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more exciting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click to apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection surrendered some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what opportunities you & Gpovmodeler. hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytransformer is an Render method to produce a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you find a scene raytracen, the rendering of hypothetical rays from the perspective of the spectator (i.e. from the camera, which the scenes are reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects are reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects. thus, the scene pixels for pixels were processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see without a camera nothing, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you see also nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously needs any scene that should be hindered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in default file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already have saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. it is a new file, you have to enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Displays the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry you can only select if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">To the most recently undo-made command. this menu entry can only then select if you have used machining.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog, in which you enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add new commands to this option for & kpovmodeler; commands or new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove the tool icons for & kpovmodeler.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a way to customize the surface surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes, which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then passed on to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis, by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kukshow; is a comfortable image-image and a browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & spherical show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can enter with clicking the & LMBn; or the return return can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust if every image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a particular file, simply type the first signs of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a suitable filename has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog, there are five card cards. in three of them, generously and editing and slideshow, you can set up the working method of & spherical show; set in the two other, short command for the scoreboard and short command for the browser, the keyboard shortcut for each window can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are opened in full screen mode. if the picture is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can set down. default mode is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Is this point activated, loads & balls show; already the next picture in the folder, while you still look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">This option saves & cuddshow; when you opened the name of the recently opened folder. at the next start opens & cuddshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bars to choose a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode, the window is larger than the image, is also filled here in the background with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can create & spherical show; thus set up that only some of the file types can be shown that the program can also be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option for large images the display ster is enlarged on the full screen. this option is enabled as default.</seg>

<seg id="1142">The interval between the change of image at a slideshow. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sliders or small arrows right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions is set to 0, the slideshow is repeated until it is interrupted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sliders or small arrows right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the shortcuts for the different modes of operation of & spherical show; in the card cards short command for the scoreboard and short command for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option you switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolder and a window for files) and the one-part view of the file system with folders and files in a window around.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays large icons for files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short description.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface from Amarook has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists, playlists and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarook supports the command line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback when the script can not be executed because of missing dependency. please check your script whether all required modules are present and use kdialog so that the user does not know why a script does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin does' Corundum 'Rescue LoadError error =' corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script. ''kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the base for your own scripts, or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can replace your scripts with Amarook and Amarook. the simplest way is to use the command dcop; that each KDE installation should be attached.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the executing of external programs and commands. this is usually called Exec () function. in this way dcop &gt; relatively easy to be called. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all ongoing scripts. for this reason, scripts will constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script should ignore the events even if there is no use of it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure indicates the script to display the layout dialog. to store the storing and loading of the furniture data, each script should decide itself. if a script is started, Amarook the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signaled that a new piece is to be played. the script may now ask for example; with DCOP functions further information to the new piece (for example the metadata or the length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signaled a change in volume. the new volume is an integer from 0 to 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Custommenuclicked: subveritable mentions, contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can also be identified. to remove the menu a separate entry, one can use the DCOP-function dcop AmaroScript removeCustomize (submenu-titles).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarook; it stops, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to work for example. such as the storing of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar) which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2) which allows the user to recognize the archive clearly as Amarook script.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarook; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the expanse of amarine script. for this reason, you should designate your script packages immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main critic has to be executable (+ x), the remaining to be chargeable modules should not be executable. use the Tar-parameter -p to get the file's right:</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarook requires only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have Cdelibs therefore installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presupposes that your window manager will function the relevant standards of freedesktop.org.

<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the TagLib library. you can see the file being fined by logging in ~ / .kde / share / apps / license _ scan.log. please report this bug to the day Lib developers under bugs.kde.org and also attach the caputte file that has caused the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly, it is that Taglib siashes when reading the Meta info from this file. please report this bug to the day Lib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, please sample SQLite. the support for this in & Amaroah; is a little mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries are compiled by & Amaro; used libraries with the same compiler version. if such as & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib, but with GCC 3,3.x compiled, then this leads to tating the meta-information.</seg>

<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser design. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreters. these three subwindows are later still lower in detail. they provide information on the ongoing piece on each different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you already have previously used earlier versions of & Amarook; you might be noticed that the subwindow will start off. the information presented here are now collected in other parts of & Amarook. moreover, the information in the Statistical window may be collected (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The sub-window music displays information about the current piece, as well as the performer and the album.</seg>

<seg id="1367">Under the search filters there is a selection box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can also choose different timestamps, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. of course, you can naturally also select your total collection, whereby the filter is practically off.</seg>

<seg id="1392">If you give a certain search-old, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: &gt; 50th This is looking for pieces, which have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for one piece, which does not contain a specific search term, ask a minus sign before the search term: -something is looking for pieces that does not contain.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntaxes for popularity. for example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield or higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment.</seg>

<seg id="1453">Normalize: this tool is used to match the volume of music files to a standard level. this can be useful for example to create a blender CD's and Mp3 collections; without normalize the different top-level of the different albums may lead to the unbeautiful effect that the tunes can be reproduced differently.</seg>
<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically replay all videos in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient method, recently opened projects again. the associated sub-menu contains a list of these projects. one click on one entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. once the project has already been stored, the previously uploaded file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new filename.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new filename. KDE's dialogue Save as is displayed under which you can choose folder and filename for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all opened projects. that's the same as if you would call for any single project file saved.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project has changed and has not yet been saved, asks & K3b; according to what shall happen. you can then choose between save and changes. besides, you can shut down the closing and keep the project so open.</seg>

<seg id="1461">Includes all opened projects and finished & K3b; for each nostored project will be asked what it should happen, as if you were called the file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">If you access this entry, you can choose the dialog files for adding a project. that's the same effect when you view the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the so-added files appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the characteristics dialogue of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; to burning the medium. the distillery can only be opened when the project is already data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described above the What is this? aid described (accessible using the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it is useful when you're involved in a previous session to the current project. this is useful when you're not used for a multi-session CD. it is useful for you to see if this function is not used for you, so that you can see the files already available on the medium already existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function causes & K3b; imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function is not removed from the medium, it blends just the previously imported files again.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD-copying dialog. alternatively, you can also create an image from a CD onto another medium. alternatively, you can also use only one image from a CD which then eventually can burn later on. besides, there is also the possibility of running instead of normal copier. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD Copy dialog. alternatively, you can also create an image of a DVD on another medium. alternatively, you can also use only one image of a DVD instead of normal copy, so the target can be large enough to record the entire (video) data from source mediums in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete all content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W) whereby the content is completely deleted. & K3b; lets you choose between the desks and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously prepared CD-image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as data source, which can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button. (Nero * .nrg files are currently not supported, you will need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously set DVD-image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as data source, which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously illuminated DVD video can be converted. this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table, but can also be allotted also used. it contains information about the read video, body settings, and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the available medium. this information is displayed in the table view and include characteristics of the medium, such as size and title-length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of the toolbar of & K3b; when an entry is listed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is crossed, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not intersect, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Enables the folder view, or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives. if the table view is activated, its content is displayed in the table view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info, locks and locking the disk or discharge of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Enables the table view one or off. the table view allows you to select and drag files into the project view. the table view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Switches the headline in the projecar view or off. the head bar is a narrower area that contains only visible when the project view open projects contains. the headline has no real function, it looks just pretty and separates the projecar view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b; here you can use general Programmes. almost all functions of & K3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialog is intended to personalise and for the fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is like many other & KDE applications, also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionality of the function, therefore rather your taste and the type of your task is decisive, which the condensate programmes give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP; features you need to make sure that & K3b will be started. then you enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions, all & KDE; programs reported, supported & K3b; mainly two other parts which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP-Interface of & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPrecreateDataCDProject () DCOPrecreateaus DVDProject () DCOPrecreateaus DVDProject () DCOPRecreditch Project () DCOPRecreditch Project () DCOPRecredit- Project () DCOPRecredit- Project () DCOPRecredit- Project () diformatDvd () at burndvd () at burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP Rereference to the newly generated project: # K3b --audiod and then receive a reference to the project by means of # dcop K3b K3b K3b Interface currentProject By using this reference, it is possible to modify the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which is only applicable on data-projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Avoid createFolder (Qstring name), lymphs (Kururl, Qstring Parent), bloveItem (Qstring path), in renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname), mordial volatieID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">For example, it is possible to fill up a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT C3b K3b createurs dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -readable for & KDE; with it can be easily read audio-CD; s, and can be saved in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading from & CD; files in WAV files on hard disk) and by many codes (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (verlustfree compression) will have to be installed from Linux distribution). further coefficients can still be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD are read; read and compressed into WAV files on your computer (unloaded and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per titles) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also other formats such as loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the read the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. nearly every distribution has assembled a pre-compiled package; if this has not yet been installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you need to be lame (for MP3), oggie to (for OGG) or other coefficients. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions. however, only the encoders need to be installed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word of copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; and this program is not intended to bypass the firmware of the CD; / DVD tool protection, it is not possible to baccuse a protected audio CD; Even in any case, it cannot avoid the mechanisms of copying protection. avoid the purchase of Copper-protected audio-CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While inserting only once must be done (the furniture dialog can be called so often as far as a suitable configuration was found), after reading a & CD. this results (hopefully) to understand the slender approach of the user interface, which will frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on what encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can record & CD; information from the freeDB Explorer and can work completely without network, whereby everything is manually covered.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a brief list of commands of the main window. on the page step by step there is more information, such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder so that the selection can be read with any other encoder as the standard. it is to be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the dialog settings in the dialog dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already illuminated file will be selected instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the layout dialog to configure the type of alerts (like protocols, piepages) for program events (like reading the & CD; closed).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main entrance dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (like encoder, for setting the Encoders). so far, you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coarer and compression rates and helps you with choosing the right cop.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other like 'shorten' or 'Mon', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, you lose information through data compiling according to their psychoaudible model, MP3 and OGG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important as both Kodizer produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most of the distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up very high quality quality (with high bitrates) but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deep bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special car stereo. today - initially 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters to audio quality and get out of the compromised compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset media '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces accepted transparency and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo-stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -B 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and car access systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or retrieved by the program automatically generated from the freeDB over the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / sell with & sound audiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coexistence programs, there is often a combination of programs for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders declare the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords, if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator; the result looks so: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters used to be used (= garlic-drawing in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database where people can download the audio CDs and enter the information, so that all the others can download this information rather than yourself into the calculator. it is to be noted that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes it should be legal, but I (Anm of the Ueberry: that's the author meant) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent that you are inflicted by the & CD; more or less worthless, so the information can be inflicted by the artist nor the music company. all the information can be obtained in a bummel through a & CD; business, physically, or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; an active part to select (send an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (counterfeit) address when used in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address can not be used by the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code).</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries copies of the main database are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; to use freeDB shall be needed for the use of freeDB. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org offers a current list of mirrored on the online call of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (generally created monthly) only the actualizations of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which version is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used to know that it wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD. please note that the cdparanoia package must be installed at first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save time-read WAV files, the code can be selected and thus selected the desired file format. at first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the code. other coders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution, before the code can be used. this is also required for predefined encoding. more information about Kodierer can be found in the section Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code you can get more information about his switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolation window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and readjust on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio-encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the bouncing of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, these tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, read everything and start our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to produce MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1545">There have to be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine as it is not necessary to compile source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please ensure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have screaming it (eg by trying to copy something into the conqueror something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably only once done and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the cutting encoders for the compression of music (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). when we are lazy, we split the program to use the freeDB program to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it with any read of a & CD; change when the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is handed over to the video program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device designation of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD Drive is available, it can also help the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries available there for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card card General Settings. here gibts do not have much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything becomes as loaded / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of complete information can be found so that you will be informed if details are missing for the witnesses of keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card-card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD to download data automatically via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during the read of the & CD; connected to the Internet so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD included is made immediately, when you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filename or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory / filename is changed with conqueror &gt; filename, and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is further to note: if you want to manually insert everything manually. however, this over 620 MB large, consider it twice if this is profitable. to use freeDB in the offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode will be set up on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us of freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server via the Internet. how do the system knows which data is to get the CD? read the section about FreeDB. do everything in the screenshot now.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the page freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will function as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function regulates what affects the server, because there are many firewalls record the protocol (880 default), there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; Protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to submit any & CD; data to the freeDB server should be deactivating.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? paralleled reading and encoding? the author knows it not, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, let this be dismissed to the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: when you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are stored. this box is not listed, the files in the private folder are created. do not forget to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All as if it is on the screenshot now. the command is a bit long, under certain conditions, something must be kept to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio-quality, even for very good HiFi stereo-stereo. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the generation of tags at version V1 / V1.st. Kid3 is an excellent 'ID3' Tagger for & KDE; in case of a later change of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files at once: when dual core or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can try to code more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as standard for any read of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, such as the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will need to be described in this section, has to be repeated for every expressive & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is not yet included in freeDB, the screens are a little different from that for a & CD; with successfully removed from freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually insert it out of the internet. comments are indicated to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' output of the author of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD must now be defined in the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, just like the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been successfully met by the freeDB, all the titles are already completed and the name of the artist and album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there will be a window splends, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best for your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have a tick-box for automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but you need to get data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: CD-Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Reading title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be typed in the input field 'Reading title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidiets per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of data from the freeDB is the CD-editor not empty, but it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor, so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with big letters are beginning or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1-tags. this is limited the length of the fields below 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2-tags, you have set an unlimited field-length, at least on what's & audiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set in the Settings menu, just take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the Kodierer in order to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously subject to the style of the uploaded CD; in this example, this is not important, as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway does not submit. for further information go to the Internet page of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you entered all the front data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the item list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check character before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked are read. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off. make sure that all the pieces are selected, or if you select the button All pieces at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection out of the read-reading process, so this window appears to confirm the confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what proceeds.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to turn off on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is read straight to the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will look you when you're trying to work with an encoders that you have not yet installed. pieces that were not successfully coded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the tmp file and target folder are not what we typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have typed writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. so you can read and code parallel. notice the status registration at the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration default to repress this behavior. the only one that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. at low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with a AMD64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous interpreting and code (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the final title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the cooking. after the last piece coded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window will end.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator; you need & KDE; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the codiles of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; used today within the & KDE; CVS as part of the weaving media package. however, most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & KDE; package is included. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to individuals which compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for assistance as the program can be adjusted to your needs when it runs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls forth many different programs, has many variations of settings. best you can read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screen photos of different card cards of settings and also includes comments for options that can not be used in example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still on reading? even if only the help menu has been clicked on for the first time of the program, without any clue as it should continue from this kind of empty screen (especially if at the time of the program do not go audio-CD; in the drive), or from the unusual brief menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; you can do it. at least only after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has described this section and is therefore with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange, if you succeeded in getting the source file from & KDE to SVN, then you don't need these information but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& colmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoker of & KDE; in addition to others he has not having real-time-consuming and karaoke-real-time highlighting of texts also some characteristics, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, thus it should work on all systems with OSS and & KDE; support. & colmid; also supports the & Linux; ultrassic project driver that is needed for the CIS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequence.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& colmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through highlighting of the pressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can enter into & KDE, any MIDI file from one & conqueror; window on the Mid set.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (songs events or text events). KMid determines automatically the used procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you end & KDE; during the playback of a song, KMid starts again with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI-synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS maps (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also let a file from one & conqueror; window into the & kmid; window drop. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and enter the button finish in the toolbar, select the entry play from the menu item or enter the spacebar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces, it will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song becomes too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed. to restore the original speed, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The spacebar has two tasks: when a piece is played, pressure on the spacebar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry into the menu item, so interrupts the reproduction. enter the spacebar while no piece is played, starts & colmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and again others. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & colmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically identified that you need to manually set a song, so that you don't have to manually set it manually. you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a sequence type, select from the menu settings the entries of textile events or song events. the same function also includes keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these will be played in line. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To insert a collection, first open the collection manager. this can be found in the menu collection under the point Organizing.... Click there to New and give the name to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs in the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the slipped in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection will not be stored. concern yourself when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the button Add a song. it appears in turn the file dialog, with which help you choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is activated, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When the Automatically Add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the newly opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played off. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu playback of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove random order in the menu, the order will be defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selective list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump to a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song back, select the button previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the button left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the Collector Manager, select there the delete collection and click on the delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this doesn't matter because it is not saved by leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-map general-MIDI events in events that understands synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that turns all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of Type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always lets a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, do not need any MIDI map, because all soundcards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS maps, FM radio devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-map is a text-file that stores all necessary transformations for playing a piece of piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. for this, however, that every appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP, A further keymap... "END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END, that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard will be shown. the general usage looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the simultaneity is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AlKeysTo M is needed to place all sounds that support this instrument (GM-patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun powder. to do this in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun signal), it takes place 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch, where every sound is a different percussioning instrument (drum, basins, Maracas & etc;), and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as well as the presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can use multiple Keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you just have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to form tints to the Persian channel. take a look at the included Keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section may be used to deduce some channels to other. if you want to switch for example the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-Devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built following the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is pictured on the Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined in the file name for this channel. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all the events are ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case then always Patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the perky patch on the Perkrolling channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for Pitchnaming ratio is given in which the ratio of pitch-bender events is multiplied by the value n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal numbers).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM indicates that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find the right value on your keyboard, you need a little bit with & kmid; try around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole row of pivials (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivatures, you see which tints can be played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, lights the button no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played tones. view in the menu settings under the point edge view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played off. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slowdown it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file on two different devices can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can compel anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, whereas a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression mode of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; have happened because & kmid; without Awe support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's Starting)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">To do so, supports & colmid; drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & conqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable the adjustment of automatic adding to the collection. otherwise the files are added to a temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD in order to slow down the reproduction. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD-double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have been playing on a & KDE; desktop area a & Konqueror; window with my MIDI folders and & colmid; on this workspace (if I want to play a karaoke file) or put it on this workspace (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I want to play a file, only entered the & conqueror; window switch and drag the file into the window by & colmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding directly to a collection, turn off the setting of automatic adding to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose that you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first, you just want to play the first file. so, set up the setting automatically to the collection and opening A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then unlock yourself to play B.mid and C.mid to create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. all thank you! if I can hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me that, further to & colmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& colmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez. I'm written in the third year, so I'm not a lot of free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a little time for my hobbies, but I try to take me a bit of time. as hobbies I have programming, MIDI files, make music and prove them.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files when you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ cde.org or antlarr @ araciis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home town or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, if you want to send me a MIDI file, but if you want to contact me, as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and don't get back to anyone for that money. I therefore want to stress that I will only be more programmable, because / if I come back feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the net, giving us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this can be found & colmid; also found on his homepage, which is found under http: / / www.arThris.es / ~ rlarpink / kmid.html. you can also look at links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A soundcard. I recommend you a good soundcard or an external synthesizer because the sound quality is essentially dependent on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an Awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have sound card, you must compile & colmid; with the parameters MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, as if you had a soundcard, except that you can of course hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If trouble occur, contact one of the & KDE, mailing lists or send a message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMpeg. the program is used to play video files uploaded by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD's, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & KDE; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE Website to new versions, or send the question to The & KDE; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made from the so-called windows. there is always the window with the central view. either, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is a information window that will only appear when information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to merge the preferred links under the bookmark bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which can be played after each other, so you should use the category Dauphin playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. if you have a listing, his group and all of its sub-groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the raised entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' updated piece ', television and durability, can also be done by direct editing of XML configuration files. of course, one can only do it if & kmplayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by application itself. just click on a name of a category clicks on it from the menu View and the next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to be chosen from the menu same with playlists and select either the processing mode, or selected a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the machining mode left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Following the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and filling can be disabled by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayblc and Changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / exmplayer / exit.xml are observed. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be disruptive at the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the adverts of a favorite picture: & lt; yea; yea; and lt; IMG Dur = "inquired" src = / lt; / bodywork; yea; / bodywork; yea; / bodywork; yea; / bodywork; yea; / bodywork; yea; / bodywork; yea; / bodywork; yea, are included in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here, the path can be set from the MPlayer and the storage size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this renown in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayblc. here is an example of a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted into the special field Embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Thus the & kmplayer; 'flash' can be redone in HTML pages, the & kmplayer, module needs to be specified as a service provider for the MIME type / x-Shockwave flash in the furnishings dialog by KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library. if no errors occur, the backend issue is available inside & kmplayer; (View, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So doing a given backend for a certain MIME type is taken (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayblc. for example, phonemcan describe all the ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can playback of TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxbplayer). before TV can be stored, the scanner must be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be manually edited.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To Configuring the VDR (Video Data Reorder) Settings in the kmplayer is the dialog to use in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; XDR- &gt; XVideo port. there, ports can be found out of which a coding must be found (e.g.: PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR is supported by kmplayer only XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only working method). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension needs to be functional for the X server. therefore, for the XFree86 server needs to be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

LaTeX commands deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into some elements. & latex; educate the subdivision of the document into the following items (part is the most part and subdudes the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When viewing the document in the structuring, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse-click of the respective document.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful in creating your own & latex; if a DVI; -file [framed file], jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information such as font and is next to PDF the final output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, conversion and print of DVI; files for different systems and uprights.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the text search, the elements of the DVI; -file associated with the editor will be clicked, is the exact opposite of it. once you have clicked on a section in & latex; source code is clicked, becomes the corresponding point in the DVI; -viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work with other collabor.tex files is simplified. when using a project a project-wide Master document is set to set project preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Rapid superstructure: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (if no errors in the source code are available).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File level: in this mode, the DVI; file on Ã ¼ nderuntâ t made possible, and there is no call for & ocular; after the rapid superstructure.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In contemplating the machining process, the three large numbers of components should be taken into the document. the first choice field has been developed for the rapid breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is to the introduction of articles such as keywords, joints, or references. the optional features are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a description for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: is used for the reference to a fixed name (selection of a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When passing from quote will be displayed a list of literary entries. for the editing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and the & bibtex; files can be written naturally also in & kile; from hand to be written.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ³ Ale is used for determining the fonts. it can be set for the main text, the fox, etc., there are the following typeways:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; there are two choices for setting: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of documents and stacking the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand on hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the command\\ 'Documentary class contain the settings for the command. the writing [12pt] lays the typotions. will not be set at the beginning, this can also happen also in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has to be entered the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to this is the use of the menÃ ¼ s or the Knopfs powerbuilding.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved in front of the compiler. & kile; to store the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">You are missing the compiling of the document, should be sought automatically in the logging of errors. when using fast construction, & ocular devices should be started. this is not the case, the logging should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the writing will have been created. the command\\ '{environment},\\ HUGE and\\' {environment} can be taken into the environment. (English. HUGE).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The amount will only be supervised within the area (from\\ '{environment} to\\' {environment}). there are no signs for transport within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to protect the readability and user-friendliness of the document. it enables you to set certain typostage, fats, coups, submissions, etc. these commands are either using the command\\ or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the short print pressure and is long as long until he is closed with a\\ '{emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be noted with\\ emph {words}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ 'rate: made a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\' {rate} and ends with\\\ 'rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; -Outline language was represented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be accomplished for the better readability of the document. to this, there should be a quotation, some places in the lipos- and short-term pressure and a poem for the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, using editor-view or Strg E can return to the editor (when internal observer). with an external observer, its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and receive fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a small file format (engl. D e V ice I nve). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of the .dvi output, as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -converters or computer imaging.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document (see). by clicking DVI - then the document can be printed by file Drucken (in the viewer) (if the printer is set properly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar buttons created the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code has been created, the conversion can begin into curved other formats using the mouse buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-finding is the direct jump from the editor to an associated position inside the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. to this end, only modern settings must set up with settings kile... tools build up.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To move the precautionary solution, the mouse-cursor is positioned in a line of the source code and be clicked upon request. the jump to the appropriate point in the DVI; -viewer takes place so then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & ocular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; taken by & kile; in & ocular; as Textsditor has to be set (settings ocular up... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should if the use of rapid superstructure of the & DVI; -viewer does not exist, an error may appear. should be a mistake, this is displayed in the log file or in the Newswindow in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file is the fault of the error source in the source code. in the editor you can always view the error correction of the faults. the log file is always the line in which the error appears. to click the faulty line, must be clicked on the error in the logging and & kile; jumps to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the appropriate button is clicked on the toolbar, a window appears for the selection of the submission templates for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">In the selection of empty document, a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard for fast creation of a new document. further information is included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Ugly users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates can be placed in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file available or a new file must be created. & kile; can create a new template by means of an existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template, new strings are replaced by other data (such as name or drawing). these variables can set up in settings kile to set up basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTINS $$: this drawing chain is replaced by entering document class. typically they are used as follows:\\ 'Documentary [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTINS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and hence the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document then your own template can be selected rather than the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. will be searched for a simple way to create a template, should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described under described steps.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibilities of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for appointments available directly from & kile; can be made out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and its possibilities to experience the manual is to be attracted by Kate. users of & kile; can begin with reading the chapter works with the editor of & Kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; instruction reference, which can be called the MenÃ ¼ Help LaTeX reference reference. it includes a detailed description almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use you can find as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-clicking with penetrated Ctrl key to wading the & tex; word means that in this way, by clicking on\\ par\\\ 'by\\' par\\ 'by clicking\\' by clicking\\ '.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When drag the text with the left mouse button, the text box will automatically be copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with penetrated switching threshold you can choose parts of the source code in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibilities to browse the various types of source texts and to highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can choose the jumping mat brands. this is a separate type of bookmarks within the text. this is also highlighted the jump to teh or the last jumping brand. this is also highlighted the jumping brand, so that it is automatically extracted in the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile; although & Kate; already outstanding possibilities, were added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code; special orders for their selection. under Edit excerpts are the following commands for the text selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines included on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph does not contain a text of the same line (as in other Textsditors). this extended meaning do not include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive thing in & kile; is it that the Above is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also latex; commands with an iron table (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To the spoilt of a part of the document it may be removed from that first and by making the button anf. & Kate; offers the keyhole Ctrl; K with which the entire row is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands, the following commands may contain for loosening of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit in paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore offers & kile; for other commands under Editing surroundings, easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, to the start of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to pick up the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command leads to the end of the current setting (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to pick up the area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front or within the command\\ begin {surroundings}, becomes the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering a lot of spached ambient commands can quickly be lost the memory view. this command close the most recently reached environment, so that the concealted ambient structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups, which are determined by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match them from the machining environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will be preloaded to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the bracket clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command the cursor is set to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the paced clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the curly clamp of a & tex; group # is located to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a lot of veiled groups-braces can quickly be lost in the memory view. this command close the last modified group, so that the concealed structure of the & tex; groups are not broken.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple application signs are used as a GÃ ¤rents. for the purpose of purpose the sign is used. & kile; knows this case and deception two instituting signs for llatex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of double characters can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX - and signposted.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use LÃ ¤nderspecific settings (such as ngerman or French) and thus German or French characters. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">In the drink of Shift; input boards. if the current position inside a lists -environment (such as enumerate or itemize) is available, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a tables environment close & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an end-up balance.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to be supported on preset & latex; - or Custom-defined environments. these can be placed under settings kile; establish... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users mapped the columns in tables - environments and thereby all the Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; tries to empt this. if this spulator is not the living, for the shutdown & kile; several interspace for the columns position of the current tulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already offers a good source code recognition, this in & kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) are still expanded. all of these modes can be set for different working methods of settings kile to set up...</seg>
<seg id="1839">In the beginning a new environment by using the command\\ begin {surroundings} becomes & kile; automatically add the command\\ '{surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">Upon the tip of the RÃ ¼ inch the last letter is removed from input and allow the default list. on the other hand, the list may also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions can be found even when selecting a command. alternatively, jumping coupons can be found, so that a simple jump to these positions by means of editing jumping markers is suitable and the requested parameters can then be explored.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings kile; set up... kile; enforceable settings to these lists are made. it enables you to choose different winding lists; - and & latex; commands, as well as winding of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is intended for the understanding of environments not back. it always uses a few letters with\\ begin typed. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the understanding of the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete mode of Alt + Shift key + Shift key + Shift key is automatically executed and it appears\\ '{. afterwards the environment can be continued in the easiest way and will be terminated by the scope of the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is accomplished, the surroundings will automatically be closed again. once & kile; recognizes that it is a lists environment, is even a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings kile; set up... kile; enforceable settings to these lists are made. this mode uses the list of subsistence mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supporting user-defined lists of supplements which are replaced immediately by athletic strings. the lists can be set up under settings kile. as an example of a recovering list, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L entered and the word transverse the menÃ ¼ inch mode, the letter L will be replaced by the character chain\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Groomed e WÃ ¼ rÃ ¼ rents are not helpful for automatic realizations. however, it has been found that many hamlets can be written in a document more than once. so it offers & kile; the transverse for everybody is already written.</seg>

<seg id="1854">To be able to place the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped in the menÃ ¼ s creating composing, creating transformations and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for observer such as & ocular; or another transformation can be used by Alt; 3, by means of Alt; 3 the DVI; 4 the DVI; 4 file into a PS file and be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quickening command, it is normally called an observer after the compiling. should not be used an inhibited viewer, every time a new window will be opened.</seg>

<seg id="2031">Although skilled paths allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH It gives other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file is called file: / out of the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% PID: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantapod; only one instance runs, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP are used to control & quantappoints; from an external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script can send a script of & quantappoints; at the default edition can be determined, which is to send to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected part of the document will be sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types issue: normal output, written on the default output. it can be specified, which shall be done with the text written by the default output by the value of the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you must add and configure your actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all the necessary fields and add them to the fitting toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, in case the tag attributes has and you plan their use, enable you to edit dialog "tag, if available to make a entry when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is represented better, we will use & kiconedit; select out of the & pot;, graphic other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a startup as a symbol. by the use of green (green is usually interpreted as useless, rigid, further interpreted) or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol is to insert a tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it must still be associated with the promotion. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaptim;) and selection of the desired action. beside the text field there is one button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the insert button and continue it with other tags, so there are still which are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantappoints; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators in multiple groups. open the toolbar icons to set the toolbar. make sure that the desired toolbar can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separators (entirely left up) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example I would like to preview a quick way to access the conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note that separators will support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar; could believe that the & conqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button be.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by testing all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after NeueXML does not exist, it will be placed in the right folder, but your toolbar icons should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar can be loaded (n) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most remarkable extension of & quantappoints; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter, how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could look at & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. the first part we leave you, the second we handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc you = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = = Sec2.1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.html &gt; 2 = functioning 1.html Day 2 = Day 1.html tag 2 = tag2.html tag 3 = tag5.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree. for example you see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc you = php42 / # top level element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntactic.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # ahead Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is the subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit to chess boards (except for reason) mdash; but try it out.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the index directory is referenced directly onto a file (and consequently the upper end of the tree-view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but be careful on & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; - based & quantaplus; Resourcendatters will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The table section is the area of the docrc file that is to be displayed for the design of the context sensitive aid. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of by-grounded context-elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file dcrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these well and worth it are to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not get rich, but proud to have been involved in the best Web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantappoints, you are not alone. it is possible to divide the feature resources (DTEP-packages, workpieces with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) send with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and Visual tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantappoints they can download. the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and user-used for publication. to sign up a beneficial contribution to what it takes a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you may need to find out. in the dialog New resource, you have to empty the input fields (URL Preview can remain empty) and with clicking the OK button will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can be uploading from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and scripts can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still prior to the installation, examines & quantappoints; the integrity of the resource by examination of integrity and Signification. if the integrity given and the resource is accurate and the resource is correct to be signed, a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML-languages that is currently not yet supported by & quantaptim; it is possible to work simultaneously because a DTEP package can be necessary, because hundreds of tag files in the day-XML format could be necessary. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and Convert button of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. after that, the following dialogue will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quelp folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definition line: the string, which in! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML Public - / / W3C HTML 4.01 Transitional / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / mute.dtd to appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if activated, brings & quantappoints; after converting the & descriptionrc; Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantappoints, there are some key concepts. to understand these and take full benefit from & quantappoints, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter will try to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantlers; little utility.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantapSaul; the labour area is divided into three sections: global, locally and project. this distinction involves a number of components in & quantappoints;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantappoints; use, available. by Workplace via actions, everything is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantappoints; this enables the group of administrators to secure different workpieces, actions and patterns in the global tree, which is then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements constitute a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and workpieces. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns up to workpieces with special promotions especially for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most complete size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowering common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editoring window, the building views, the cartons with information and the toolbar. please refer to, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">One can click the card's driver with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document templates, to upload, delete or uploading the document, jump or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editorfield lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), processing of under the mouse-cursor, help to the word under the mouse pointer or opening the file, when the string is referred to in the mouse pointer to a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorwindow, the toolbar of the editor will currently take, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is displayed as a standard for which a set of toolbar icons. in the course of further expansion of & quantappoints, the toolbar will be adapted to the new features and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; then click on the icon that represents the day. now, they can insert the data for this just one day. you should insert the data for this just one day (such as Anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) allow it to navigate into the information of & quantappoints; to navigate, they are to open and roam. in the representation of cardboard boxes stand for files, project, sample templates, scripts, attributes, and documentation of building views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantappoints; this view displays all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by means of right mouse-click. actions such as adding, removal, uploading or deleting the files from storage media can be performed using the attached context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of goods, is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the ground floor. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects are available only in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration into Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script. the right mouse button are available for further functions such as the script to boot, edit or send with e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. through left-click of an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right clicking an element it opens a list of commands with respect to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other building views. with it can change manly attributes and namespace. that is based on the contents of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web-technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantappoints; from the quantapte; 'documentations site can be used, and by adding a folder doc to a project can include project-specific documentation, edited and looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two card leaders at the bottom of the window, can be achieved using the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box-leader displays information on each in Quanta running script. such as the DTD of the current document and all changes used to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cartography shows all errors in the mark of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantappoints; worktabs are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed. the chocolate side of the toolbar can be defined as symbols in & quantappoints; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantappoints; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail; sends the toolbar as a compass Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar like any other, save and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantappoints to your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options to get to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting from & quantappoints, you should check if your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin folders. also you should make sure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH ahead of their bin folder is. the same applies to & Qt;</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantapSaul; is a web development tool for KDE surface. & quantappoints; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While striving to create the best & HTML; Editor, the developers began to employ & quantappoints; an independent, extensible Markup languages editor would? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantapt. now is already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. together, if you can define it in & XML; then you should be quantappoints; therefore the suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & KDE; developer community is based. & quantaptim; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why anyone has developed? thanks to the & KDE; scaffold is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers, & quantappoints, as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to make the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity dramatically. by program compass, you can notice them & quantappoints, without having to remember anything script language (more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for rapid web development and has quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More to the detailed documentation is help with help: / quanta (either this URL in & conqueror; insert, or khelpdesk help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Wiitur @ cde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ cde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick attacking list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file which is not located on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check in the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre-device, only one error messages are reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts with insertion from the clipboard provided special characters to the & HTML; Sitting, so that it is displayed correctly and not be misunderstood by the browser as a form of formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; to write, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. first and foremost to inserting & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables the blockchoices to or from. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift; to select down.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages can be found!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not on. that's the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and intimidation of problem solving at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a single click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries of previous or neighbour, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file name .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Browse the project directory to new files that could be there. that allows, e.g. to copy graphics files to your project folders or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded another one / output module (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaptim; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantappoints; projects can be explained by the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project-tool-toolbar. these are kept in Project You / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have associated them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be saved by means of settings and you will be added when you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removing a toolbar from the field of view. this does not deletes it from the hard disk. if you have not saved the toolbar you want to do it, you will ask if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send their own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantapt.; team, so that the toolbar can be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbar on the main server, wherever anyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you have done someone else or anyone else and convert into the & quantappoints; own description.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities of the & DTD; it makes sense when the entities out of the & DTEP; are to renew, without the whole & DTEP; to renew it. if this global is global and a writing to the global KDE folder is not present, the shop failed.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags, which are present in the currently charged worktabs. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar can be loaded, there is a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is available in the menu tags always available, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantappoints are denied by means of the toolbar, if this day does contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu the available plug-ins listed under the above-listed menu items are listed. click activated. click on a activated plug-in deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntactic mode for the current file. the list of available posters schemata depends on the colates; -version from.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of Zeiling identifier. very useful when you know people who using other OS platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate interconnection between the different types of the interface. by some limitations in KDE libraries, the reverse mode can sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the cartoons mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantappoints; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for every open subwindow. with a selection of an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window or out.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influences each application that use the KHTML-Part, including the & conqueror; web browsers.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Is the behavior of the Editorwindow. in the documentation of & Kate; one finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog will appear where you can delete or delete entries from the toolbar or to change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create an aid in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with every open source project, the developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantappoints; development in financial form can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed at the top from top to bottom, for example by filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all of these paths and author information fields can be set later on Shift; F7 project project properties can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantappoints; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine, which you want to access, one, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the default settings of the selected log files will be used. depending on the adjustment of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be set rather than standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files for various projects is used, this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">"" "" "" "accused of files that are to be involved somewhere in the main folder of the project. if a project is started again from scratch, not anhaken." ""</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact choice of thinner.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by Anhaken or, by removing the tick, clinging out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the program window in the sub-window profiles or with the shortcut Shift; F7 changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard possible) that can be re-ignored in project-related surgeries such as projections.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are removed from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded at the opening of the project. can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the required debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is available in. the debugger plug-in can be set with the Options button. in the debugger option is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles you can upload uploading profiles (see in) as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for any profile, by pointing out a dedicated view to each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the sub-window configuration configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the sub-window event configuration, one can turn the event action and add these actions, modify or delete. event transactions are executed when a previously determined event occurs, such as the sickles of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behaviour cannot now be influenced by default.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose the project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantapSaul is closed, the project file will automatically be stored. you will ask if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantappoints; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management gives free access to files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behaviour like, however, are missing the entries Open and Open with... in the right mouse button of the right click menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only more a profile exists, the button is shut down to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the kernel memory and forget with programing. this option is useful when most frequent upload files is needed and the rather non-secure password on the record is not in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantappoints, many high load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog displays:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service to the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety-shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it can't be easily read, but everyone with programming results can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbar. it can be loaded into a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange views, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved in the menu Project or the Project toolbar, easily accessible or deleted using settings toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter discusses the parts of & quantappoints, with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows modification of & quantappoints; to his own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, Workblasts are designed in & quantappoints; best about the toolbar icons. use and adding differ below in the section Adoration of works-blasts.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar icons and the icons to it can be set using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar icons), in which with New action, you can rename other actions like toolbar, toolbar or toolbar, which can be specified where actions are visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Through the call of the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, you will also be able to remove the entries and show action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up parameters set up in the menu with settings toolbar... and set settings actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essential documents, code carving and files to connect. & quantappoints; used templates, basically such as a usual file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or delete any existing directory in the predictated tree. templates have in & quantappoints; in about the limitations that one can imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantappoints; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of every template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; binary files are usually inserted in documents by means of links (e.g. pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the curtain-tree under global templates. further information about the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, a simple scaffolding can be found for the purpose and organizes the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the curtain-tree below global templates. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text range is always included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are in the curtain-tree below global templates. see in for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are organized for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a computed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantappoints.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a documentation structure to Popular (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As template to save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once it has happened, you notice that (even if it was stored as a project situation) the template is not visible in the project-tree. take a look at the curtain-tree under projections.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template to save a selection as a local / project situation. alternatively, the selection can be drawn with pulling and draining on the tree-oriented templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied into a panel folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling and weeping or inserting the file tree by Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files, you can select a folder on the right and create site template, secured a name for the template and secure it. by default, it will be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can set headlines and footlines or dynamically with PHP; design files or link with them. additionally, one can keep some things in using templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder is in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties. the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is abrupt, as soon as Eltertal Attribute distorted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapted for anything except the master folders in the pre-day overview. if a regular folder would be set in principle unless they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text blocks. if nothing appears, you will probably be in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you set or set text for templates in this folder. these could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents into a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation already with the headers / footer headlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (thereto show right mouse button) about a complete command collection for adding folder or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source code Editor, which can be reached via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code Editor by the VPL; Editor and the second divide the editor window into two parts: the source code Editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; Editor in the source code is visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor in a document, the & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohanding of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; Editor, the source code editor will continue to edit. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly as the first, except that simultaneously the changes in the source code and the VPL; Editor is visible and the cursor in the source code editor and in VPL; -Editor is already active, this mode is already active, puts the press to the active cursor from one window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization balance between the VPL; Editor and the source code Editor is set up via settings Quanta; View can be set between synchronization after a click or automatically. in the selection automatically the recommendation can be adjusted in addition the time period. basically the recommendation: a small skilot for fast calculators and a large skilot for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so tools document features are possible. this concludes the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; Editor. the document features are also called when a new document with the VPL; -Editor is created. this helps to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information on the document itself e.g. headwords for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows the change of content, e.g. key words in column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS-rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add CSS-rules with the buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is exactly as shown in the meta-elements. the editing of CSS-rules is currently not currently supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style shelf by pressing the file-open button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is like in a text processing, due to the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual. the marker works as usual. text can be inserted through typing or delete-paste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way over the toolbar, such as in the source code Editor, which is to be noted, that insertion of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when an anchor day, enclosed with text must be removed every other inverted anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they are later used in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; a tool for examination of stylishtemplates. in contrast to other programs for stylishtemplates, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the styling can be prosecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparing. so why & diffuse 3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The assemblance was very complicated because one of the contributors has done many changes and at the same time corrected the cataption. a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts in co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the modified lines I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the filing had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a row and changes to white signs. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quick text, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function made a lot of work was the comparisons and assembling of folders. this function turned & diffuse 3; almost into a complete file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way intermerging will be fully supported. this is useful when two persons can work independently of each other at one piece of coding and make changes. in this editor you can even process the result directly. in this editor you can even process the result directly. the screenshot shows three quell files in the merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& Coudiff3; also helps you with the comparisons and assembling complete folder. this screenshot shows & diffuse 3; in the folder together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and can be applied to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you need to check often code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed clearly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can look at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no annoyanger, if someone is changing the reverse.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal, and the other is different in a row, the color indicates that file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by writing just the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening-dialog enables the manual type of filename, the selection over the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the listing. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons and intermerging of folders will be selected. if for A file is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & diffuse 3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When intermerging, the input field will be active and can be dealt with. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately set an output file. you can get this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start using the same / assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog you do not have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the shutdown button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag pulling and deposit: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it drop it on a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought lies behind it? sometimes a file contains for example several similar functions. if you want to find out how much these functions are, this would be a fairly large effort. you need to create two relevant files, load them in & paste it. now you can copy the relevant sections simply paste, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can pull nothing out & diffuse 3; only the pitfalls of text in a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors are interpreting and paste text into another program than cutting and paste (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the Info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename, and the number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Everyone Info-line has a different color. (when the path to a file is too long, drag the mouse over a while on the line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the colour blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preference can be changed via the Settings menu).</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one can see in the colour which file is distinguished. (color for conflicts in the settings). the colour scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merging) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left beside the text there is the summaries column. if differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. with differences in white signs the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the microprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the summaries column of the text is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the ignition is activated, the line is shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the compares) also has a info line with the wording output:, the filename, and [changed] when you have edited the result. usually it contains through the automatic merger already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, the store is deactivated!!! (use the buttons to the next soldered / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the first line of the group will be displayed in all windows, and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also be a leap of position in the windows.) This group will then highlighted the current group. it will be highlighted in the color background color for current area and on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through the automatic intermerging or by manual editing no more row exists in the group; then in these lines the text is displayed. no row is displayed in the row; there is only one space for the event that you change your opinion and maybe you choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste it elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; breakdown conflicting; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options numbers ignore or ignororiere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating primarily with the scrolling and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard left. if you are in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the right, side, end, Strg-Start and Strg end, Siw as you can also be used by other programs. the super-column in addition to the vertical image bar can be used even to the Navigate.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In Augabefenster you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the paste button you can switch between plug-in and transcription mode. (default is the plug-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns you can synchronize the view of all windows at the beginning of each group (as mentioned in the section) and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation that you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Strg-bottom / Strg-Image), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Image westwards / Strg-Image), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-Image westwards / Strg-Image), to the next / last conflict (Strg-Image westwards / Strg-Image), to the next / last conflict (Strg-Image downwards) or to the next / previous conflict will continue to be considered a conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be differentiated.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you must press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Strg-insertion). if this is activated, whatever you select, automatically copy into the clipboard and copy the manual. be careful with this option, but you could not overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeileners are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line pre-based operating system\, and Win32-based systems use wagon backsliding + Zeilenvorschub\\ r\. Kapp3 retains the zeiling source files not, therefore you should use & diffuse 3; also not with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will automatically be stored automatically and restored at the next start. (menu Setting &gt; Kapp3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are presented in cursive script. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors might not be available in its pure form, but would be framed. on these systems the button presets automatically shows an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, inserted at the push of the Tabulator button the corresponding number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the listing of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is activated, each selection will be automatically copied into the clipboard. the manual is to be copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type-type you prefer to save. the prescribed value is the generally common selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files tries & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in source files. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step is compares every line. in this step, white signs are not ignored. even while merging, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car backlog '\' and a Zeilenvorb '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car backplate is made visible, however, as a white sign treats, however, like a white sign, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default, this option is downlighted. in the first part of the analysis, figures and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. in the result the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default, this option is downlighted. changes in comments will be treated as changes in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive after even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files but slow on very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically-forwarding mode, this attitude determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves off automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) That's useful when white signs are less important in many files. if you only use it from time to time, use the automatic selection also conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or ignorant C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options will be treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and transmissions of a clapping. look for details under documentation to directory comparison and assembling.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version of the Suffix .orig does exist. if already such a backupfile exists with the Suffix .orig it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of the interface. the changing of this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to quit and restart it, so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is employed globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding controls can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you have enabled this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the range fields for coding appears a short indication of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreting. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have a file edited, you can specify which encoding for storing should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing command, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files can be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be done with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress Herlighting of changes in white signs in the text or overviews. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring or caporiere C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. after choosing A & lt; B, A & B; B, A & B; -gt; C or B is displayed; C or B is shown in addition to the normal yet a second super column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. make sure you simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window-menu).</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the same side by side or another. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window-menu).</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the clapping and uses the filename of the last source file as pre-issued name for output file. (if this function is used to start the merging once again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will pass on to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own generator, which meets exactly your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut disruptive parts or correct the assessment.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is passed first to this remote command (see above), then the output of the command is used to input this command command. you can write your own generator above. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external application is required, and most users would like to program that not themselves. the good news is however, that in most cases is sed or perl completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for zeiling to convert the input into large letters: sed 's /\\ U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ (\\\ 1 in the Replaceable string refers to the found text in large letters. the\\ U converts the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all the\\\ _ BAR _ header\\ (revision\\ _ BAR _ header\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed experimentation, you may start to understand it and maybe you like those regular expressions, even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kapp3. however, it is good as an example of a further processing command for Zeiling. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a suitable matches, and each suitable matches is replaced by nothing, so that is practically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead, you can also need something different such as perl use. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch 'allerdings are needed at perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the "\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and assembling. further operations can only change the data that is the Zeilenched-algorythm.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal predictator, the Zeilenary preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit programmers in a folder lots of files. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to create a proposal; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the assembling and displays the simulated changes without it really carry out,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... takes selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and assembling of individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no target folder is specified, used & diffuse 3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not start the clash. to start the merging, you must press the respective menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder will inform you a small message window on the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed there, which were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning the folder is finished, displays & diffuse 3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found in the scan will be found here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed together. you can double a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all sub-directories, and all sub-directories folders with which you can capture all folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file will be started immediately and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column Name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the assembling-off action can not be selected automatically. if the merging will be started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, are used in columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow, and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be considered identical if its entire content is identical. then also folder the same color. in folders, age is immaterial for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a Blattes back, which is only green, then yellow will and later when it is old, red is red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if there exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified and when the option directories are synchronised. then select & diffuse 3; the required action to save both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merge together and save the result in both folders. (the user sees the visible file name for output file only B; right after the merger may be copied & diffdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option new file will be used instead of conduction. if the files are different, but the same date is identical. if the files are different, but the same date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. If such errors are not removed, the merging of the folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging a file after the other, you work on one file after the other. you status column displays skills when the co-run was successful, and according to other messages if something inaccurate occurred. if the merging is completed, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the interior dialog is chosen the file method of complete analysis, Kapp3 further columns will display. these contain the number of monasteries, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected item (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all of the compositions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then in the three-folder interaction mode, it will be used as the target, used in the two-folder merging, B as the destination and when it is used, A and / or B is used as a destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries should be displayed in the target folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options over which certain entries could be skipped. check these options to avoid unloving surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory assembling / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcuts). to run only the current entry: select promotion of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If through conflicting file types still invalid, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options flow, simulate and break down.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes will be made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute specific actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a merging window opens (notice the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again directory assembling / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog will appear. then leads & diffuse 3; his work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you look at a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages that should help you to check out the cause of the problem. you'll have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually combined, you notice & diffuse all entries (in the current session) and will lead them up at the later of all entries. even if the merging of entries was transferred or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the assembling action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kapp3) has now a section called Inventory with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (such as * .cpp; * .h). folder must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered into the elementary tree; use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be entered into the elementary tree; use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files which are also ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder is to be adjusted specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems a file is displayed as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: when the option is off, symbolic linkages compared. when the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On links to folders: when the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that a link can lead to a link loop and & diffuse 3;) This option is switched on the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of Deleted deforter, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files that does not contain any text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster, only the changelist and the file size compared. however, this speed test will cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is plugged into default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical. this can be useful when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is plugged into default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified in this mode. in this mode, the suggestions for interaction results are selected. also, the results of the merging of files are stored in both folders. this option is switched in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead the merging of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe, because it's the knowledge provided that the other file is not also changed.) This option is plugged in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and maintains the extension .origine. if an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, this will also affect normal intermerging of individual files, not just the merging of individual files, not just the merging of an existing folder. this option is switched on in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folder crash stays visible from the merging of individual files; you can move the window butor with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the option list & text window into the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, in the directory menu, you can also run a corresponding menu navigation menu. once you save the result, the status will be done and the file will not be merged once again when you merge the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is however lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparent with the help of KIO slaves. Kapp3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders for opening, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively undown. or.. included. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mascot. (# - &gt;% 23, space - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file associated with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be differentiated if a link indicates a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit authorization or modification of change. therefore, the eligibility or change date from the original. (consider the option confidential the size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as differences with viewers in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in-in-viewer. to run Klamp3, press the right button of mouse on the difference viewers and then select In Casdiffusion 3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & diffuse 3; two complete input files. however, when it is applied as a part, takes a patch file in the Unified format. then, & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & diffuse 3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kapp3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable, if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; when part is executed, it supports only the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or the same of folders will not support in the part-part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kapp2 (now Heist es Comare) are already there. in addition, the name Kelo3 already points out that it can result together as the program diffuse the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for very long and have learned a lot since I've watched in the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or going to be so going.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be told the correct prefix. in the default configuration in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs is different, these lines are usually treated as identical. if however, only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines made up next to each other, this is steis the attribute this is made of the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes each difference in the files where it begins and where he ends. this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information goes out however, if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for it was so far too big. you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger quantities of text should be used by another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src has left; published and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; used already many colors to highlight of differences. even more herbulation would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and news reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; use them, you need & KDE; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Klamp3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourcege.net / Changelog, or in the file Changelog in the Quell-package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & paste 3; in a system with & KDE; to compile and install, use the following command at the base folder of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; auto-conf and automake used, you should not have any problems with compiling. however, difficulties occur, please report on the & KDE, mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies in the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Strg-V or Shift) adds the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure, and therefore also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version you must re-update the folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries indicated that the differences are shown. if the target folder files are not already copied in the target folder. if the target folder of these files does not already exist, they are probably missing after the merger. (the behaviour will be switched on in a later program version.) This option is switched on the default folder.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to choose the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be displayed at the end of the selected group in result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse-click, once the mouse-cursor is for a while at the same point. it is meant to help people suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) 's syndrome and which each mouse-click pain is prepared. however, it may require a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer due to the mere identifier of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even more clear: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to avoid the cause when clicking with the mouse, it is against pain, which is caused by the cause of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can vary for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse-click when you interrupt the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart tanning is activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after it has emboiling the mouse button. now, move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before the sloping can run the mouse button. in this way, you can execute the drag-right mouse button. in this way, you can drag the drop-down mouse button. this smart tanning requires a little practice, but you get used to get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This devastation must be dusty after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; one mouse-click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is enabled by intelligent delay, the rotational field is devoid (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; the mouse button is waiting before it leaves the mouse button again if there is no time left over the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shorten the reaction times, go to Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the tab Android. there is a slider sound buffer to shorten you to a lower value to shorten the reply.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting marks, is started & kmousetool; at every start of & KDE; started. this function is currently only under & KDE; available at GNOME or other window environments, please check the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all the settings back on the values that were set when opening the dialog. did you already apply the button down, the settings will apply to the stand after the last squeeze.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first of all with preference. in particular, the smart tanning you should first let off. if you then hit the automatic mouse button, you can then go to the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to verify the answers of & KDE; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse-click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not display any link, does not lead to unsolicited reactions. you can therefore park your mouse on such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is rugged, you should purify your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you will not only cleanse the mouse-ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse over the mouse. as this happens, from mouse to mouse different. but it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and dirt can easily scrapped with a flat blade or the finger-hedgehog.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system collapsing the execution of & kmousetool; when you have just begun a delay, it means that & kmousetool means that the operation cannot finish more by the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; used under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is to run yourself a mouse-click. here, the status of & kmousetool is reset; and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to the place where you want to have it. but you can no longer run the mouse on a neutral part of the desktop, if you don't want to cause a keyboard shortcut. safe zones for the mouse-cursor is a privilege; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the titles of the windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart tanning, but I don't get it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart tanning is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy text to copy it into the clipboard and want to carry back any other action to move back into the clipboard. but there will probably not even cause problems. here are some advice on it:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart tanning, if you are just beginning to start & kmousetool; select text instead: execute a mouse click at the one end of the text box and keep the switching mouse button pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and keep the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Therefore, use the audible mouse-click. it becomes jedestimes when & kmousetool; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse-click. so, you know exactly when when the smart tanning the delay time begins. later you can use the intelligent tanning even without the audible mouse click. however, it needs some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; use the XTest-extension for & X Window; installed in most cases the case should be the case.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a soundcard and speaker and are properly furnished.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; plunged the mouse button once the mouse-cursor is short verted. this program was developed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome and which the bed of the moist pain is prepared.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filtering is being sent, before he will be sent to Speech Dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with specific deficiencies of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "Speech Dispatcher" works with a text. there are four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen remembers has the highest priority. it will be drawn from all other orders and holds this orders. if the output of screen reader is pre-read, the orders orders will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the nearest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you & eg; a long text on a web page can be read, you can go to & mouth; someone who just enter the room. & KDE; notices are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text messages. each order you encounter from the card's orders is a textorder. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text messages. text messages are meant for the issue of longer texts that have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queue, with the exception of the issuing of screen revisions. if an application sends the output of a screen-aders, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen revisions. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on KDE, messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts can be delivered either as words or as a regular expressions. it will be supplied with predefined string quests such as: -) by text or for the reformatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; - reformer use a XSLT-file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format into another format. included in the package range. are some XSLT files to translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker cable filtering, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; if you have set the text message for example on the card-card speaker, you can read text of KDE-news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has a adjustable rules, after which he is used for voice purposes. if the filter does not indicate that his rules cannot apply, he will continue the text to the next filter more unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a textbook, a message, warning or a & KDE; notification is sent, it is edited by all activated filters supplied on the page. the processing by the filter is done in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished normal filters. is a filter does not intersect, it is not activated and is not used. filter are labelled from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be shown further below the following piece of furniture.</seg>
<seg id="2638">If you enter a list of words or regular expressions, you will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text. large and small-fuse is not observed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. this name allows you to select any number, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter is comparing the text with the strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the marked word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list, the entries are displayed from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Is a language entered here, the filter is only used when the speaker speaks for the textbook one of the languages listed here. click on the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse-clicking the & Ctrl; button pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is registered, the filter is only used when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can type several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application-ID cycle programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers, you need to escape. if for example & qdbus; the application ID-3432 points, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The drawing effect filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box diabetic filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of the mentioned languages can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, drag the description of synthesizer to the supported languages rate. look at the website of ktts;, according to information that are not yet included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "Speech-Dispatcher" uses a adaptable module-architecture for language synthesizer. if you would like to expand & ktas; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filters is not imperative. Debian users can install xsltproc using the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktts; to compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the packages, and the development files for the program "Speech-Dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source texts from & ktts; from the source code archive for kdeported or have downloaded the ball-ball, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; use first, check first if Speech Dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizer. you can use the shell script SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & KDE; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; that is used the program Speech Dispatcher. the program kttmsgr is designed to be developed so that the setup of Speech Dispatcher is not required anymore and the script SPD it is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled in individual propositions. the user can go back - or deviate repellent, repeat the issue or break down.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application provides text on & ktts; otherwise, it may request the properties of the preferred spokesperson for the output. thus, an application can request a female English speaker. if you choose one speaker, whose language is English and whose gender is female, this will automatically choose the best suitable speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktts; one speaker selects, see you in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on adding speakers to adding and then click on adding a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card-card spokesperson is shown. as an example, the setting of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. details on the modules can be found under.</seg>

<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you make volume, Interphone velocity and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can not choose a few regulator and this gray can be displayed, the voice you chooses not set these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices need to be loaded on account of their size several seconds after their size, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (a large storage area), the first set will be more quickly synthesized.</seg>

<seg id="2703">This card card allows you to set up special promotions that will always be executed when the textbook is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processed four types of language contracts:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen remembers has the highest priority. it is drawn from all other orders and holds this orders. after the output of screen reader has been read, the included orders are re-recorded.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news like & eg; processor is reserved to hot. a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text. this orders will continue after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you have a long text on a web page, you can welcome you with & Ymouth; nevertheless someone who enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a textbook is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen Reader, adds & ktts; the audio output in queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played if a normal textbook is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card card apply only to normal texts. for messages, warnings and the issues of screen revisions, there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>

<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels of events. for a particular event of a certain application an action is set, this will be executed. otherwise, the action for all other events of certain applications is executed. as the last option comes the action to carry out the one under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event all notifications for the Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. you can specify the alerts as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the button save to save the settings for the notification in a file. use the button shop to load stored settings from a file. the invited events will start with the events in the list. if you want to begin using an empty list, click Delete. all entries except for all depositors will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output, the speaker speed, the sex of the voice and pitch. moreover, brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You will need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (Britable man) since this is the default vote, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog will not be limited to 100nbsp;% is set, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! DOCTYPE / etc / Speech-Synthesis / synthesis.dtd "&gt; Who has slept in my bed? asked Mama Bear. who slept in my bed? asked the BärenChild.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and profiling filters (SDSFilter). SBDs can also be synthesized, because only the first set must be synthesized, not the whole text assignment. with this, you can also check or cancel the entire text contract, even if the language synthesizer does not support it directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the profiling of recognition. when the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as a statement by a profiling of recognition. you can change its settings or add further proposibility filters, but the beginners will not get out of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">In the easiest way to try out the setup of the speaker selection, select the speaker selection, what speaker & ktts; choose a few features and check how the selection of the spokesperson has changed. of course, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktas; then faster with which can be read, because only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can hold text messages directly on the card-card orders or break down even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal proposition is automatically set up automatically when you start toptsmgr for the first time. it can not be switched off, just removed. change anything about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Typo patterns in this text compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tabular code (decimal characters 8) to the propositional sign (decimal characters are removed from the text). note that the standard set limits for the character does not maintain.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters will never be applied to & KDE; News (killer), warnings, messages or the output of screen revisions.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set of knowledge filters, you can insert it again by clicking the file standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card card speaker selection, you can overwrite the Speech settings for the application. the card card will be shown if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the topmost on the card spokesperson). in other words, there are no speaker properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which displays all properties of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise selects & ktts; the spokesman, which corresponds to the original properties originally introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired page properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the desired speaker. if this property does not play a role, do not give anything one.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this tickle field if the property must have precedence over other properties. you can also put several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output is, this feature is always treated as a priority property. you will probably use this property. the only case if you possibly want to specify the attribute language, is ahead if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the field of speaker, which corresponds to the following to delete, click the default speaker and then use on speaker, which corresponds to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last textorder in queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, input 0 is required).</seg>

<seg id="2798">This handbook explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf; one module for the & 'controlcenter; to facilitate the management of network interfaces, routine and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & cinematic center; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings on a uniform, integrated surface. the & 'controlcenter; can be called by selection of K Menu or controlcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings is displayed in the & L _ controlcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in the & cat-menu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware can not install. physical devices and their drivers have to be functionally installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and enables the setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed when installing & Linux; installed and installed. network devices later added, the drivers must be loaded through adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network settings is loaded, when the option is selected for network settings in the & Backcontrolcenter; index selected. when starting the module network settings, this is automatically trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the commercial selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and releasing the release is best matches. by flagging the setup non-again, the definition can be permanently made. at the next start of network settings, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system administration mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can be viewed only, the Changing is not possible. in the system administration mode, you will find by clicking the button administration mode on the right bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the total functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. by the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings indicated can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button to set up the button.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Extended Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of Automatically, TCP / IP settings are fetched by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP address will be performed with the start of system services. the DHCPD or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP address at every system start, so no further adjustment may be required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection of Manual without DHCP or BOOTP can be set out for TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the required TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask is the subnet mask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this adjustment is marked, initializes the system the network interface when boats. if the initialization is not desirable, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values contained in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off according to your needs. switching on the network interface is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switch off the activated network mode by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Puts the IP address of the calculator in the local subnet which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with networks in other sub-networks.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than one network interface, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS-support replaces a complete residence permit by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer http / / www.seredomain.org is required, the DNS accepts this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The host to name-resolution part of the rider name solution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified by selecting an order and up-up or downgrading in the list with the buttons or can be ordered in a priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group Computer to the attrition solution, a DNS server can be added. it will add the new nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Computer to the naming solution, select an entry and then click the Edit.... It will display the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The List named named Calculator-to-IP-address-references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily by boats if no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of specifically known computers contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this is still going to replace the version of IP in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New alias dialog will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known computer has several aliases, de button Adding several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of an specifically known computer from the list and choose Edit.... The dialog to edit a friend.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It may be one of the following tasks run, then clicking on OK, the list of static hosts updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings that are made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, must be set in a & console; the following command needs to be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetwork.sourceforge.net you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it ranges when & KDE; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; using rpm as below to install:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphic user such as cpackage, or the installation tool for their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE is sufficient, but in addition the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkconf; to compile it. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be given, in the second all of the & knetworkconf; variable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found big distribution. by IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this description is therefore concentrating on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, on & eg; Workplace is the network administrator which may apply a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can not be chosen as desired. in any case, the IP address can not be selected as desired!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When inserting a separate small (home) network, IP address should be selected specifically for this purpose to avoid IP address connections with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set on 255.255.255.0, so all computers participants are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0r; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback adress (localhost = the own computer). the default route is required for the IP redirection.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. usually, the address is associated with 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are placed in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically to DSL connections, so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand then expected can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the securing files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only be saved to that file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in local file tree with a tick. only the so selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog settings for backup. in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives on the disk. it will only be checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives on the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog settings for checking. in this dialog you can check again your selection and change the folder subfolders for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for review, the dialog will appear. this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you manage the restore, the files you need to be restored, this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the belt drive. it will only be restored to select the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the so selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and choose to restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog settings for recovery. in this dialog you can even check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will appear again. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band indexad file using the belt content. this process is deletes all existing Indexfiles for this band. you can create index on two different types of volume:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Here, a backup profile is created with the just selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be made. the list of selected files will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, is that only those files are stored on the same file system, as the folder. folder that are stored on other file systems, you can enter separately under backup files. each entry is considered independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used only, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshots file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons, gt; and lt; lt; files were not yet fully implemented at the time of creating these documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings on menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the bandage (usually / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-recommand variant of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting actively, transmits and soldier; before the band is involved the command load load to the drive. with some drives this is necessary before reading or writing-operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, tries & b; the throw at the belt running gear. possibly this attitude does not work with all the belt drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, when solving the integration of & b; automatically the tape is rejected. use this option not at floppy stream.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, tried & b; the hardcore block size can be changed for the belt drive. no all drives support variable blockages. no matter whether this attitude is active or not, you have to notify & b; in any case, the block size for your belt drive communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When a soldier: a band formatted it writes a file to the beginning of the banknote. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is billing: seconds, with the name of the complete name of the system, on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds, which since the epoch has been formatted in which the belt has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band-ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kerning.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives which allow themselves directly to & GNU; - tar can be managed. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not an incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup database. this symbol is only active when a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystematic log; is a & KDE; viewers for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. furthermore, allows & systematic log; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystematic log; helps users understand what your machine is in the background. the task of & ksystematic log; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited with the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & systematic log; experienced users give quick access to information on issues related to their server. & concsystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced functions, using which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystematic log; a number of useful features include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also contained in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot displays & concsystemlog; functions available, with which help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file easily filter and sort out. the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the ksystematic log; first the most important protocol of the system - the system Protocol - to open it. it will not be displayed, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you can not find a small message window. the protocol files can usually be found under Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user does not usually have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filterbar to filter by selected criterion or after having entered a string. in the default setting, the list box contains the entry box next to the filter. then a protocol line contains only displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course choose another entry. the string of the filter search will then only be replicated with the entries in the respectively selected column. for example, select the name of a process, so it shows you & a systematic log; all the protocol lines sent, which is sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in default and helps you see the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error will be shown with a conspicuous color as a protocol lines. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in cron protocol), so you can test the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the Start of Samba server. in this case, you will use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to display new lines in the context menu of the main window in order to display all the new record-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystematic log; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystematic log; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information on the sources of transfers from & ksystemic log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& concsystemlog; find also in the following folder of the & KDE -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & KDE; System V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named as & ksysv; this section lists some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V init rapidly develops to the standard for checking the program at the high driving of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not enter here further into historical aspects (among others, because I do not know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt to make a machine on System V init, without a reinstall and reformatting. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service, which you want to start at the peak of the system or when changing to another Runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not involve such things such as setserial, which only once started. such a call belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand at / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even though it does not actually have much use to do so. you can also let a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run on driving something that has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find that the previewed Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, you can fix it / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful, if you have a slightly propagation, then you come to restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type -l enter into rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stopping init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K contains, the script will start with the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have a server -Runlevel, which lets only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user -Runlevel, that's & b;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services on one of the six rounds level to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position inside a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if the entry is from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only does not happen if they have an entry in the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved, if you want to move them into a new zone. to simply copy it to a new Runlevel, you will need to select explicitly from the menu Edit or from the context menu, and paste it into the target area - even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to recover entries that have been thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to enable the different workareas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. connect the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are running.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are recovered from & ksysv; restored. changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have been experimenting with the standard Runleveln and now the machine starts durability. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I made some system services with & ksysv; for the execution under runtime X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit extra files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services can be started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary furnishing programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are needed from the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) simply stop without notice when their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save it. you can either use the appropriate symbol of the toolbar or entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the username list. for editing the desired users or the desired group with a double clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog User - or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only shown when you've activated advanced system settings. only if you are using space options (Quota) for users will be activated, on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards will appear, if shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unix systems are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-tab is displayed in case shadow -passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if it is activated and initialized in case of a specified file system (Quota) file (Quota) file (Quota). here you can change parameters for each user, with the placings each in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field of file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card-card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, which the user belongs, can be found in the field primary group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking those in the big box.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's properties contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click on the appropriate add-button of the toolbar. the editing or deletion of the selected user or the selected group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager to remove the boot password, remove the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change, change, and more.</seg>
