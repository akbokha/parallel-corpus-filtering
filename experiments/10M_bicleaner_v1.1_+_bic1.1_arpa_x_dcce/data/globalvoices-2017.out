although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
as many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of a oil magnet that was the top of the Supreme Court with judges , who were keen to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; mir was it , as if this is the absolute truth , everything else , that is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very black@@ ish love @-@ letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp was born .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and the racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes round with his hand @-@ minded .
he never stops behind the mountain on how to say so beautiful .
he says what he thinks of how a former colleague express it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ US and Women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes , which he won at the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number , which ever reached a party candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ est person , I asked me ?
I could not associate Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people whom I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of journalist , people from all over the world participates , a deep believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , Tru@@ mp@@ s world@@ view did not agree with the from Peter Bh@@ atia , the current publishers of the &quot; Cinc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ atia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s In@@ intolerance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I lived at Sandy B@@ ahr that fought their lives long , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
it also fits with the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values affected by them are their love for America .
during Tru@@ mp his way to the nom@@ inee of the Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to its limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly past@@ es , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were prepared to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as a r@@ aci@@ sts .
to submit people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
that is superf@@ icial and respectful , and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
could it be that these voters , of whom most know are , for Tru@@ mp , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who sees the cru@@ el decision to make a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; drawing of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; words from white in bac@@ kl@@ ash on the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what does the great Van Jones called , has exactly what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may still have , America welcomes everyone .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Kenya , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise , and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of wording with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud , no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fr@@ at@@ ly the amount . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Lat@@ ino a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answer it .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their votes were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a vocal and vo@@ iced &apos; NE@@ IN &apos; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words , &quot; God is thanks , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tru@@ mp@@ s country , &quot; said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and this leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura jointly ?
that the music that is played at both places not only has changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 o@@ dom@@ eter south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) plays an existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome them with their musical instruments .
a music @-@ school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and banking violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and gave the youth such a sel@@ dom hop@@ eless situation .
the young band@@ members take their obligations to the Musik@@ group very seriously , does the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI editor :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to meet their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and playing with glos@@ sy eyes and play in the chest you will learn day for trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , Clar@@ ke , Clar@@ ke , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga .
music from the gar@@ bage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is practically located on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are produced from re @-@ controlled waste material :
music with recur@@ ring instruments , which consist of local fixed waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling led by F@@ avi@@ o Chávez in order to transform portions of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ating viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , viol@@ ins , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local o@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura at the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the gar@@ bage , the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them don &apos;t live with their children .
this changed as a F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a made of waste produced in waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ fine material and called The Recycling Orchestra .
a documentation of &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world produces approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra has even played music against Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight against illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights against illegal fishing .
this entry , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa it was well @-@ known that this ship had already been operated in Leban@@ ese waters of illegal fishing , before it was looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore expressed and incl@@ ined to welcome a legislative break@@ er of this type on its shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Kom@@ s , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised himself against the ship . they occupy him , one of its har@@ b@@ ours and refuse to give him a fishing place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ members of Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries Policy . he is part of a team that discovered the ship at its time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , due to pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NR@@ O Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries who at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . you exchange information and stand together when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , present because it is extremely difficult to catch up , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
by the obvious cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing ecosystems can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ per@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ dle and also by the sn@@ ail , with the information between individual countries , so the actions occur today in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists existing lic@@ ences , up @-@ to @-@ date activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port spec@@ ulation .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . also allow yourself to discover so susp@@ ects driving routes - some such that indicate that a ship charges its flo@@ ated fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies may show whether the ships involved have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a pen@@ al code .
countries which are against illegal fishing boats , may refuse on the basis of such information in their ports . what does the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultation company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD to lost sales , who lose eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year due to the illegal fisher@@ man who penetrate into East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing centers , present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
to their practices include events such as sailing under fal@@ ter flag , counterf@@ eit@@ ed licensing papers , indication of f@@ anta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they targeted the lack of international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a non @-@ organized control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she could not miss a ship illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; You don &apos;t miss my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has revealed criminal networks , which had counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been tr@@ acked and found vol@@ ved ships .
due to its cooperation with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for combating crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over great distances .
&quot; some of our investigations perform quite far into the networks organized by organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships precise .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to det@@ ach the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very in@@ geni@@ ous techniques to hide their activities and their position , and that we try to cross through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at Tracking , an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be obtained by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects various information levels with each other . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually exert influence on this undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch with Google and the Prot@@ ective Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data , and can be rendered worldwide by means of the position of every tracking ship all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply gives sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine its resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run on which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but they also sc@@ are deter@@ red .
ships which earlier without a license w@@ f@@ ished and hardly expected with consequences , they now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in the meantime found a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats in order to buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia , Gre@@ ko had helped to det@@ ach Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow , whose use is prohibited .
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing annually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there six countries joined the West Africa Task Force in 2015 . it is now fighting against illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the target , even more such initiatives and structures emerge also in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member states with his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under fal@@ ter flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 made a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a professional journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .

the road movements in Venezuela seems to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the election of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government had refused the opposition of the opposition to a referendum on the term of office , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans rejected the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country into empt@@ iness , taking into the streets together .
below the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north @-@ eastern parliament of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans due to a acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition have been blocked by the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes place in their latest article in the context of the government notes as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and gar@@ den@@ ers are among the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and extensive lack of food and medicine was the only way to conquer the country to conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .

especially large waves hit the message via pin suppression in the central north @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters went back to the local Cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advocates of government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to with@@ stand the police forces , including those woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry a skir@@ ts because one else could see what many national gar@@ ages do not have !
meanwhile an Info@@ graphic has already made an Info@@ graphic the round , which forms the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an office process in question - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the road .
my@@ te@@ ks Media Lab@@ s :

others are witness@@ ing these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government which made a little bit of the devastating economic crisis from their point of view and would rather concern critical voices against the devastating crisis :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more of frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they are hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba .
as an meanwhile , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano , now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined , which were committed during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the peasant , the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military occupation in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of life for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child of 15 years you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his Father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ow@@ eri@@ e@@ pers . during the Argent@@ ine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of State r@@ or@@ ism , his father from 1976 to 1978 , was his dep@@ uty director of the secrecy 141 in the prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anos son , a man who realized over the years the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall for military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . I had dressed myself with a boy who made martial arts .
all @-@ called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend to it .
he said :
you are an ar@@ hole , you have wounded yourself with one of the ERP @-@ friends .
pass only on that they don &apos;t have a day and I must save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolutionaries People - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &apos; Party in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become an o@@ eff@@ lu@@ ent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
on the military base , I had to destroy Pap@@ ers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ pag@@ an amat@@ erial , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ there are the prisoners being tor@@ tured &apos;
my dad took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - stood .
everything about it was stolen .
he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket ti@@ lt bag and commanded me to wear it for the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen objects were completed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wn in and saw a lawn that were tor@@ tured on the people .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was buried there .

the sten@@ ch there dr@@ on was f@@ oul ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and myself became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself , How is it possible that a man can do another so much suffering ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &quot;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs , and were loos@@ ened .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses , on which naked people with the face down@@ wards - all were captiv@@ ated on hands and feet .
near the entrance to the entrance , people remain silent on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see so , Ar@@ sch@@ loch ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I did not deny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you come to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was killed by soldiers and buried .
I know that , because my father spoke at home about it .
in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms that were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put a man there and sle@@ w a man .
( according to the survivors of the civil war , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indi@@ cted in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process was indi@@ cted for students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia leads , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former folk chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names have been changed and they got assigned a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the arrangement from above came that they should be displ@@ aced .
this was the lie - of eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the descent of the people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War @-@ mare &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things to go home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; - how they called it .
but when I was later on the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war men are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military marks , which one decreases a enemy that one has fought .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war , but vector .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you sti@@ st cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in front of anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you to her own .
for this we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time when I had a jacket and a wheel@@ er pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he nevertheless brought clothing to his home .
back then , the defence , a co @-@ con@@ sp@@ er in this crime had been to be . I tried , no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted .
I was anyway there to declare .
&apos;@@ The wast@@ ing of the body is the last ab@@ om@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have only children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
well , you have been ex@@ al@@ ted during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but why the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl with home whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply chosen to kill these people . but why their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families whom to pass their mor@@ tal remains ?
the wast@@ age of the body is the last des@@ pic@@ able act you can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to eliminate the mor@@ tal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were destroyed and somewhere else - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my Father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something of course remains forever .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to put it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my Father .
the thought , to view my Father , was born during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest .
I made his accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he said suddenly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt deeply in@@ war@@ dly and asked me what the whole hyper@@ plane patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they alle@@ ge@@ dly defended themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell us something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have horrible crimes and you brought me to be a child to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he re@@ bu@@ te only &quot; Na then sign me . &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
2010 , I re@@ funds the first ad .
I have finally recognised that he was a crime .
nobody can imagine that I have been pre@@ taken . I have finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , before the end of the trial .
he was charged for 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , in@@ jus@@ ti@@ re freedom in 154 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly heavy cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a under 10 @-@ year old child .

the judgments of the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the emph@@ ases on the scale of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 .
43 under@@ op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the Court issued in 28 cases lifel@@ ong , and in nine cases sti@@ pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were release .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ condi@@ stat@@ r@@ aphor@@ ism
all the def@@ endants were during the dictatorship of the military , including former military agents , former police and civil associates .
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he arranged the following words to the Swiss chamber :
La Per@@ la was a deadly factory designed by un@@ human minds .
the Court of Justice is an historic milestone for all human rights organizations who have worked for the victims for years .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the Adv@@ oc@@ ate of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. that represents the children of people who were mur@@ dered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government passed the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial could be established there who are now managed by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shield with the translation errors at a Centre in Kyoto , in which one can extend its leadership .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers were able to extend a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his leadership , in the last month witness a very mis@@ mis@@ ed translation .
on a shield , the Japanese word was mar@@ ched ( Cor@@ si@@ men@@ sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older drivers , &quot; may be mis@@ diagnosed - maybe but also with bu@@ sem backgrounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; sc@@ ary car drivers &quot; translated .
the wrong translation was to be read in electronic advertisements in the entrance area and the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ otos . he was it , who made aware of the local time @-@ time .
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ ary mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the qui@@ ties if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite a correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Police of the Pre@@ fecture of Kyoto apologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already written in the text that they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; we sincerely sorry that older people were har@@ med by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News alert something more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older auto@@ drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but at all the occasion of concern .
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of total of 19.@@ 460 accidents have been caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors i@@ ores 1,@@ 8@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 Un@@ its .
thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of those of sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the name not named re@@ porter was published in the published version of the article comments to light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seemingly seem against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; sc@@ ary mot@@ orists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
- &quot; So faul@@ ty is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not find that that is a real translation errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so spread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true finding for these bizarre bugs in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to survive , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in case of mother@@ speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - will not be in the address language - mother tongue .
in this way , a French native language should translate into French for example - not from the French into English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be due to mis@@ understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese .
some companies that have even no foreign employees , make translations still use company internal . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge as the best to be judged , made for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ wor@@ r@@ ens and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences arising from machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a long yet human translator . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the strange English formulations in Japan , including also the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be unacceptable or acceptable as a jewelry or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous . but by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can be careful translations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serial source for its translations in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors take on internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Media and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , announces Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , that they do not have access to the online transmitter of Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations were not accessible from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV as well .
other online transm@@ itters of the protests in Caracas , organized by op@@ position@@ ists held by the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tr@@ ac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is connected , and recommended the U@@ users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet websites are re @-@ locked again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ated since 2014 when reporting protests . at that time , the Commission for tele@@ communication to them with banknotes and lock@@ ers , if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative TV channels I have registered myself at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
astonishing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ re Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ itters . this also applies to the Internet site to which the National Assembly carries out its sessions .
previous post @-@ resear@@ ches of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had the result of making use of local internet providers to stay at times . this is a technique by which the DNS server will respond to certain domains .
if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server is flaw@@ ed or denied the request at the call of such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ locking : @ el@@ ill@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ cut channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Caracas live in custody .
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in police food .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans the access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting of the current events in the country is still more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slave to obtain a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects witnesses from other crimin@@ als that were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Mr Vo@@ ices , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices , with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , which is edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household that she did not work together with the family who lived there , eat .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become of something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated in this house like a daughter .
when she was ten years old she started to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ me , one refers to Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a big family with little money over@@ comes the minor son or her minor daughter to another , plentiful family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children need to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract which one cannot lift up .
this act as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a period for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ me , above all young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonies , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ me , guaranteed in general still .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family that her daughter is in faith , that she wants to complete their education , improving their position in society and make &quot; something out of itself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family owned the girl and whose exploitation is justified by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get training , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mis@@ chi@@ elt , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the so far got relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon that takes place in the bor@@ der@@ ous in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú her body showed traces of intense pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ny Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as officials in the dormitory .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira suggested with a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murder child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela , which was deeply responsible for the death of the Cri@@ tic Society for the death of the girl .
they named the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest , and demanded that there will be no further &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows than children registered &quot; def@@ endant Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civili@@ zed organizations demanded a fast study of the case .
they want that Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo is for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes to judgment could be the case by Carolina Mar@@ ín , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ adi@@ ans are exploited not only as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , in which her father had worked , went bank@@ rupt , and lost her father his work .
their brothers had now all had to work and began to sell on the street or on the market of sweets to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood there every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
on Fri@@ days for example , clean@@ se the refrigerator , p@@ ants the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they have done with learning the more free time she had .
however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never had hungry , but did not get an unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at several end @-@ end of the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him stand and editorial from opposition @-@ newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the reports of the official media over the regime of the dict@@ ator no faith .
he kept them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened to , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; thus they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of the Re@@ as@@ í , home again their native Guaran@@ tee .
their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had made possible to lose again , explains her .
but it was absolutely clear that she got paid for everything they got from them , with their hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a discri@@ minated against that . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about , Mob@@ bing and the Shi@@ kan@@ en , which Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friend@@ ships at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time , where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group .
the insulation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society as@@ ures the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which one can share job advertisements for clean@@ ers and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the administrators of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city center in the district of As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .

the display was given five &quot; li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a el@@ f@@ th girl and gave her phone number .

in the course of our history we managed to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a business system ) during the Spanish conquest , who had to charge the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were forced to do . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys put themselves into a system of slavery in which they are light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and the view points out of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill design writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixteen Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians were recently voted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations on the use and usability of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency in order to be able to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is in charge of use social media in order to use citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , users and users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and recruitment numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , that could bring a penalty up to six months in prison or a fine place .
the bill design , which consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fts and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that is run on the Internet and used to communicate with others by means of voice , video clips and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities de@@ fy the user and users &apos; registration . it is also unclear how to account those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee Regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliam@@ ent@@ arians and Pat@@ rons of the Legisl@@ ative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password by the Firewall to get the Facebook blocks . &quot;
this might mean that Egypt plans to set a firewall at the national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyp@@ t@@ within and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it has not yet known that such plans are .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conduc@@ tors &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I feel greatly interested in the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they think that just as they could control the physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they are set up a strong surveillance system to request citizens who require a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring it to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the legis@@ lat@@ ure of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military thought @-@ art in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ised and ensures that no devi@@ ating s@@ ling on the machine is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the parliam@@ ent@@ arians Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ w@@ y proposed a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime , where a lifel@@ ong sentence was envisaged for those who might be guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leop@@ ards caused by Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they can always find less loo@@ t , endangered .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only surviving rob@@ ber@@ y in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ ory is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the wild bo@@ ar@@ se is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore reveals that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera all , R@@ aza t@@ oss in pure joy .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , which has been made in the north of Japan to rebuild the lives of those who have been affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and a atom crash in Fu@@ kus@@ hima disaster had triggered the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the pre@@ fecture of Japan &apos;s north @-@ northeast , both of which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring farmers Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ated , because the tsun@@ ami had spo@@ ilt whole coastal cities off the map .
even more the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still lived an atomic accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years after the life of the local community .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ construction authority as well as the survey results of those affected by themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( Du@@ es@@ cor@@ k@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was completed in the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s biggest success , 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with 70 percent the final conclusion is .
nevertheless , one still endeav@@ ours to move even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ qu@@ u ) in final spare parts .
after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in Beh@@ el@@ age groups .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such Beh@@ aus@@ ungen .
almost 40 percent of the Ev@@ kus@@ hima still lives in emergency accommodation in 2011 , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated income , which have been tri@@ cked according to the disaster in el@@ el@@ age , were tri@@ pled in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 percent .
state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were hit by the un@@ happiness , their pen@@ ned until December 2016 again , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fecture .
six years later , the construction of industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fecture is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ b@@ ors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now back in operation , Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ b@@ ors are re@@ fine their operation .
the tsun@@ ami and the atomic accident , have been hol@@ low in the three f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with just 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic force , since only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , located in the &quot; nuclear wave &quot; zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism continued to recover again , but even here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still leaves far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima on the other hand can have only 75 percent here .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that since the disaster almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it is harder to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous interviews under the native population and under the evacu@@ ation . they asked them about the state of re@@ building and also how their emp@@ ires has changed over the tsun@@ ami .
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in matters of disasters @-@ prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ated from the Pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima
in their issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic accident , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to participate .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , there were more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in lasting spare parts .
after the 2017 level of 2017 there are still 40 000 citizens of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off of their homeland pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ation areas are most of the evacu@@ ation regions , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper comfort , because efforts to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . here , it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
if you meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the similarities .
after a while one recognizes however , however , that one more links than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately quite small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices , who remember a moment in which they felt very strong with someone over voice and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ ar@@ asa , talks about the time when she worked with people from around the world in London ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widely spread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care station : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ ität Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors op@@ ted him this Saturday and have now put him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures the face of the police declared that with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o Samp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that Samp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until completion of the investigation of the incident in the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he strikes at Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officers of a demonstr@@ ator would be audi@@ ted and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months on television and all the oppression would be justified .
the Facebook @-@ page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several sanitary shortly afterwards to it .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective is also shown in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another federal state , Internet users now have 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ anic Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) , to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook calls Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás into memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was founded by his father , because he was founded the Occup@@ y movement of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ und group . and now we have been attacked the sad fall of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira , who was attacked by a polic@@ eman , who was attacked by a polic@@ eman who threw it into the face with a stroke .
police force
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came against demonstr@@ ators on Friday last Friday .
police officers in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker state to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes also a report to Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again , the Brazilian media stre@@ amed prot@@ est by focusing on another , un@@ expected prot@@ ag@@ onists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo are target@@ ing a cerem@@ onial glass window to design with a photo their cover @-@ pages illustr@@ ative .
against the other hand , the O Glob@@ o prefer@@ ed a cover story with a fire set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more than a broken wind@@ shield than over the protests of thousands of people that serve to defend a special thing .
this also needs to recognize , if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ately importance , and the typical violence @-@ police force of the police force by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages of Cuba from the Ent@@ induc@@ ing For@@ gotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all Cuba opened the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the People Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que is generally known as the Central - in Spanish su@@ gar@@ mill - regardless of the fact that there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were put into the sugar cane factories .
after the yield , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the smells of steel and concrete remained .
about 2@@ 72 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changes rarely the job .
other res@@ ins and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which is rising every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not smoke his sleep .
he heard that in the east of the region sugar cane factories , who are back in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were received .
it was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members the fact that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ i would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry had already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a mo@@ tive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are already no more novel@@ ty .
why was the Cub@@ an su@@ gar@@ be@@ ers switched off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff of the community saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and almost competitive they were irre@@ portable in the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) can produce .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the rise rise on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade back .
from 2017 until 20@@ 25 , the price of in@@ geni@@ ous sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 Report &quot; Agricultural Engineering &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the pipe export of roughly 85 million dollars for the country would work for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day today will come with certainty in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there , the process of restructuring began in the be@@ et industry .
in the following years the st@@ agnation of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ating the most .
nearly all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus the place will receive , they formed a full time - working group .
in front of the first floor , the first letters began to come .
it was officially stated by the documents that would be removed only concerning the parts which would be removed , the addressing and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to approve any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility over and the letters were getting more frequently .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will on the st@@ agnation of the factory , in which building he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial sector from Cuba and the most important workplace producers has been cleared .
in many cases , no alternatives were for the work@@ places and services generated into the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for closing the sugar cane factories
since 2004 the su@@ gar@@ cane is extracted only high by Mah@@ len .

after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ me , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they started to dis@@ integrate them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without working in the region , and with already advanced old age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have been given to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene went back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .

first Nations young people use Hi@@ p Hop in order to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ ass@@ y Nar@@ rows First nation .
photo used with the permission of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an .
youth of the First Nations communities in Canada are occupied with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour have been introducing mobile Ton@@ studios directly to schools and youth centers , in order to teach youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants are involved in talks themes such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance , or whatever comes in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the day nur@@ series in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of the Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a stre@@ ak @-@ section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were killed or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the moti@@ f of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ sk@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has taken , the chor@@ us in C@@ ree is sung .
the young people involved received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group that gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page from N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an is at your disposal the st@@ rop@@ he in trans@@ cript , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like I wouldn &apos;t ever be interested in myself
but I try to go further my days on earth
that is the day when you will forgive our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
that way they can grow and also lead to our youth
so they can do what she determined the creator
in the comm@@ ent@@ ant , the reader and fe@@ eder of the C@@ ree @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also has a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ ben@@ ign ( which also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :

in Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show potential customers , what exactly is placed on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ k@@ pur@@ u ( state of the menu , &quot; plastic models of the courts &quot; ) from each dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic courses .
in the western part of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes produced by German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic courses are as usual they are not even more striking to them . however , a new trend is turning it today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published by social media links and photographs , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ h@@ back san@@ pur@@ u .
now on sale : new with plasma @-@ based mobile phones , as they are shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these contri@@ ved foods have turned to kit@@ sch@@ y items , as in this case , refriger@@ ated , magnets :
here are a few sho@@ ck@@ ling stove magn@@ ates for a new exhibition at Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ations is increasingly enligh@@ tened .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl was turned into a mobile phone ) .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as mobile phones .
also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to watch like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some mobile teleph@@ ones and phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or sal@@ mon is used , a favorite t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is someone to say there : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can dist@@ ort my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the one .
this interest in plastic foods can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members uncomfortable .
our newest mobile @-@ str@@ uts has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ bands from dried sal@@ mon .
further sculp@@ tural plastic dishes can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ing of the restaurant industry . such as with the sho@@ ku@@ k@@ purple restaurant .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in@@ - and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trading &quot; in Mexico , the missing and transmis@@ sions are regularly appearing in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy , which brings this struggle to itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the Chief of Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ell , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict perfect in the background .
on the day after a non@@ violent incident , someone looks at the sorrow or the communities who learnt to live with the pain .
they stand behind each body , behind each bone loss in the hundreds of inherited tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never be cure .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trading ) , which aims to give this sacrifice and stories of people told in the struggle between prosecution authorities and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organised crime cannot be used only for our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , if shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities allow to drive many kilometres to buy something such as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) just tells these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is seeking a secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task which we have placed to go and to graves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are aware of the insurance of my father , but that does not receive them out , because they require a treat .
where are we supposed to get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who are afraid of . we need to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the government .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexican .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
disease and sensation journalism , I have been familiar with now for several years .
I am passing each day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures that actually can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the one , that disgu@@ sted or sad . it works , like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different to this or consider it normal .
it writes on further :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year cous@@ in thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets .
for me that , as if they were the ones who have lost someone and those who have fear that they also happened that way .
I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ action of man is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the merging of 43 students in a neigh@@ bor will be justified so that they were &quot; inf@@ ant . &quot;
I think they try to argue that they remain spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies when they are not touching and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution of the four months of black@@ mailing in the main city . it describes how armed crimin@@ als has been pl@@ under@@ ed for month money from their business until it was not only destroyed by the business but also their families apart .
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life totally in just a few days .
the pain above never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high when you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers as well .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed each other , the better .
it included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kidn@@ apped or to kill .
I asked myself in these terrible days if crying would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez in Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence signed . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assass@@ inated by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ ans and he tells you to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas , tor@@ tillas , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with it . this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine Nar@@ bs on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to live with it .
when he was five years old one told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had been over two years earlier than he had just shot a few blocks from his home , the bloody corp@@ se of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing driving car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez saw the situation :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence is organised by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , Ju@@ á@@ rez , the most endangered city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 , the prosec@@ utor sec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the cut 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just some of hundred thousand stories , that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in view of new head@@ lines . but this project is remin@@ is@@ cent of those that we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ enti@@ a Vivi@@ r C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; the Data journ@@ alism @-@ Project Nar@@ co@@ data was launched , whose objective is to tor@@ tured complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading , which has folded the country in the last four decades , in intel@@ li@@ gible manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages to which he linked , contain images on which violence is shown .
the fact@@ check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift a sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ out or for@@ gery .
but how did the first appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , it tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was irrever@@ sible for use , trage@@ dies that actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our longing for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a pet@@ rol embr@@ aces the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . so 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa the second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated , the streets in the region became too dangerous paths and became more striking that was difficult to drive .
sales fell victim to the victim of the gas trol@@ ley .
authorities representative described a fire@@ ball , the incub@@ ation houses including a cinem@@ as near , which was full of people who hi@@ ring the World Cup Cup .
houses per@@ ished and bon@@ ded corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the con@@ fession .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User mysti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ 1.2 photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above there is an example of this .
it shows rows of a stolen body , which rose on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story is not its end .
over the years , the same photo has been investigated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to real trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am the remot@@ est villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses reported dras@@ tically by atro@@ cities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and corp@@ ses were burned in streets and bushes .
there were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , shot or burned .
only with pictures of satellite images , the follow @-@ time could be displayed .
the event for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army of army in Bas@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the DR Congo has emerged , when it was mist@@ aken as proof of the fact and the possible level of attack :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this predic@@ tive use of the picture from the DR Congo has only been documented in a series of mis@@ orientation ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass evaluations .
one step further bring personal comments such as this example , the image from the DR Congo , with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the image of San@@ ge came in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to an error message , published by the United Nations described those who could flee , rape and several deaths , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , talks like the following that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di Arab news page , which was random@@ ly claimed , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ one being said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture of the DR Congo to capture this information .
the original fee , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organisations which AF@@ P as their source sc@@ anned , had also d@@ oted a being of this statement , but did not allow the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false coupling cuts down to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come back from anywhere around the world .
using a &quot; converted picture @-@ search , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders .
a inver@@ ted picture @-@ looking with the search@@ engine of Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 paintings , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , others tried to un@@ lock the counterf@@ eit@@ ing .
we have been referred to examples for the abuse of abuse and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . thus , we want to be more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) can be several examples of dis@@ mis@@ sal use .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely up ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cou@@ plings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point on pages or servers over the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ se@@ minal messages are still available .
the countries in Gray are examples , according to the metadata and information that are available via the Eye , probably also counterf@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been post in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usive use of the image from the DR Congo , using one twist , the sympathy compared to the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ acre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ ggers , the cont@@ ing@@ ya are tr@@ acked to deli@@ det@@ our , since the photos of which were ab@@ usive .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a question about what they came as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional news and photographs to create international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this variation is published exclusively in English , it also includes references to counterf@@ eit pictures of rum@@ ours that run H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to present that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and other allies ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo NOT reveals Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ought His 2012 have been given that monks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article has been updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on Stud@@ ents , which had been converted by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now deleted , the Catholic near news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declares that the picture was not derived from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it is a &quot; like jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to res@@ ist that there would be links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ thin ya@@ U@@ yu@@ y ( Nigeria ) , the world is asleep ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , equipped with this wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and redeemed a discussion among Muslims after the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were able to pay a greater attention in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were picked up in no religious context .
instead , the goal of paying attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of the media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message , which was alle@@ ge@@ dly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an Mass@@ acre , in circulation it took discussion , like this one here in Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ ter feedback .
from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ inians mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mart@@ os .
there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , Ag@@ gregate and pages in the following countries ( on the folder in gray ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entry with URLs and time stamps exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and separate them on image files in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original price by 2010 , the image may ultimately be a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( ir@@ radiation ) , which re@@ moves these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in terms of greater discussions about the silence of Christians in relation to the murder of Christians through Muslims or the defence of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second shot used to discuss how an African life is assessed compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images can be used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens if readers can no longer believe these images longer .
with social media there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ tional share the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ary this mood of inf@@ alli@@ ble and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and cul@@ ated it the actual Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images was already deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that with@@ drawing from pictures of a ref@@ usal to detect the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims itself .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and viewers have des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which sub@@ mits , how violent media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot about violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
Techn@@ ologist experiment because with algorithms in order to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . you will have to think thoroughly about situation in which a picture is suggested by the context or completely mis@@ used species .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but any investigation of false subsidies should also take into consideration how international they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . un@@ covered ) endeav@@ ours to offer language fans a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words can be found in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ covered words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all conflic@@ ting stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant to that one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a whole time in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist came from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h you in recognition of your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after spending a cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
you resol@@ utely other cultures , revealing any other thought of thought and wake up our new earth .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page you want to publish more of these &quot; un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is at the moment the worst flood of flood and patho@@ genic disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , that usually ends at the end of May , are the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are mixed because of the floods and Schl@@ amm@@ la@@ win@@ en .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe place of residence .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls were left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygienic dis@@ proportion of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still un@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water level of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am ants and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ plu@@ mage , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on the road .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water was up to 6 metres . village Mor@@ de@@ da in G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the yesterday &apos;s water@@ pe@@ al of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for lif@@ ebo@@ ards and further five are made available for transportation of emergency supplies for the inhabitants of included in their floo@@ ded villages .
also different organizations and start@@ ups have prepared themselves to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tim@@ s in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka supply important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and lif@@ egu@@ ards are required for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to dry the dry foods and life @-@ needed goods for flood @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 , if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ Centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ ny Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood &quot; button &quot; button which allowed it to give users to pick up a vehicle for pickup and donations . they were then passed free to the s@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat responsibilities for the flood and lands@@ li@@ zed people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring citizens in need in need of security and help .
this has prevented loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lan@@ kas which is now facing the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
Muslims who cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
in January I attended the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and a dear friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she trusted her children ; she is my rock in the Bran@@ ch .
in one minute we are still calling par@@ lor for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ id , we turn right to trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of rain umbrellas and humans , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ to@@ wel high , tied from an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already guided this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims living in their conception .
you dis@@ solve me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we will all be put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well designed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims as I do not fit in there , ent@@ an@@ ed .
dischar@@ ging are becoming ri@@ val@@ ed
I do not go alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry in America is best selling : Rum@@ i .
which images come into a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western conception religion was deleted Rum@@ is , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduced pictures of Muslims , which has taken western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark guy you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these paintings in the 1970s .
but these images also rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood flour@@ ish them .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative will dominate our news fe@@ eds .
this cul@@ min@@ ent over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades of nine Muslim women led their countries , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential did@@ n@@ ese .
this scar@@ city failed to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are hin@@ dered to carry its head to@@ wel in public buildings and to su@@ ction mon@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , that these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercise his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ened Muslim women , the movements for change .
it looks like the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil of Afri@@ cans who have been so far brought to slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslim .
this scar@@ f , our collective imagination has been so deep and incorrect that often Si@@ kh men and children are committed to the aim of anti @-@ mix@@ er attacks and ships .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1,@@ 7 billion
in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create s@@ cars that help us understand the world .
and my industry never fails to capture the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.9 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are here that seven million Muslims form the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the whole Muslim population are African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my native parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first costume design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York , skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ sts from Bangladesh by the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan figured out the world @-@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now uns@@ ett@@ led Muslims and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - rather than my Muslim recipes , or bring my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; because of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ar , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight far @-@ spread lies over Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing band by a well established Islam@@ ists , Th@@ ink Tank and experts for counterf@@ eit information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stran@@ ger , which under@@ takes a woman the head to@@ wel .
or as the sc@@ ary card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ism in its ugly forms attack our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so wide apart , so versatile and diverse that it can be impossible to fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ berian Church in New York .
if social scientist describe religious life they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ cular faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend would see my neigh@@ bor , my neighbour , my rock in the Bran@@ ch that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 feet of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the omni@@ present ritual with my daughter when I saw her in my arms and her the Arab verses for the protection of the protection of the Kor@@ an defeated and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

belonging to my grand@@ mother &apos;s mat@@ ernal part is the image of my grand@@ mother &apos;s mat@@ ernal part with her sisters , as they win a competition of the art of flo@@ wering in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment , when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , a book with a hundred and four@@ teen chapters that can virtually im@@ par@@ able .
Muslims meant to be the prayers , which she had said to speak to me , if I have a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims is to be how she contributed to God to refer to God : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah Mi@@ an , What God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people , which has been colonial by centuries - through an &quot; Empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .

belonging to be up to grow and to hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time see that my zu@@ ander@@ ed grandfather we@@ es .
mid@@ rin , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ f@@ aded by his family in India ruled the K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
belonging to us is to know that there are millions Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , such as with my grandfather , were over@@ thrown by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world like at the play risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have reached all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that the first fli@@ pping bom@@ b of history was rejected by a century over a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , h@@ ash@@ mir of British empire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion go deeply into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ plug@@ ged history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago the migh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , who have been distributed over each continent apart from Ant@@ arc@@ tica to pursue mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried among the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslims means to know that the su@@ icide @-@ murder in veter@@ an has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that if a tragedy holds the US and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name bears , the story told four times more than a story of a white assass@@ ination .
it means to know that four@@ teen hundred years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that in two hundred years ago an African Islamic Emirate named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to that country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed when people re@@ filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a p@@ ash@@ mir , a p@@ ah@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the intimate inter@@ se@@ duction of our with multiple ties mis@@ ed identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.9 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ ni@@ cal , but it is represented in the reduced branches , &quot; we &quot; against them . &quot;
to be a mother to make me care of my child and to make all the Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged persons on these branches are structural Islam@@ ism .
structural Islam@@ ism consists in the Muslim registr@@ ars that started with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigrants who takes a five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries which bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which largely Arabs and Muslims took into the sight .
it is the wars that we lead and bom@@ bs we drop in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of which we do not tell , we are now here .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scientifically based image and b@@ ate them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the s@@ ligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep explaining the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous vivid prints that we di@@ gest it in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our often associated identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast lake , S@@ ay , from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; Schu@@ elo Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim writers and MS Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ically , mus@@ li@@ as , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned due to this difficult global time@@ point in which we are located . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason for conspir@@ acy the@@ tics that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ entially because Muslims have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially by creating the &quot; Other &quot; .
for a few years previously , she had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about realities and history , which I was not aware of as I was as old now , but I have made my daughter today , but I have made myself to an un@@ bound@@ ed Muslims .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cru@@ x track in my speech .
things that may spark memories , because in all the interactions that our human race doesn &apos;t like a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley find cons@@ ulations within the framework of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academic books talk about our problems with the &quot; Other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or we read our newspapers in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why would I describe this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were mis@@ directed through the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public conception , four decades ago at Stan@@ ford himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to de@@ fy ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously put the &quot; others &quot; in which we did not introduce a new future in which we have no president who bom@@ bs us and &quot; to others &quot; people bom@@ bed , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.@@ 7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ ator wants to preserve urban diversity
stories tell , from Flickr users Daniele Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Perry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written statement , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 events , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children there .
for the creators of the project :
the mass dying of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accepting the diversity - safe areas where residents do not forget who they are to include them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to feel , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers feature their story first in their own language and translate them then in English .
even though the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller so their devotion and display make sure that the audiences can be in@@ duced there@@ to .
they give laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows e.g. a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the narrative art for their land .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he declared the importance of his beak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ th , he shares his feeling of incl@@ usi@@ veness :
you have listened !
you were attentive ...
they were quite with me !
so far the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand it . all , who are inspired by the project , can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller .
Puerto Rico demand from the US re@@ establishment of the sovereign debt
with the aim of a re@@ consideration of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which rose to 72 million US dollars , participated in the last 3 April 2017 various religious and bourgeois organisations on a mass demonstration ; the march began at the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ental Capit@@ ol , the office building of the capital , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
called it by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da , &quot; ( Civil Liber@@ ation for the neur@@ ons of debts ) and the E@@ kom@@ en@@ ical Church of Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ ession of the re@@ vocation of debts also submitted an petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os are calling for politicians , benches and government agencies responsible for debt to take responsibility for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a governance committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will squee@@ ze and suppres@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we shall not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not be found with decl@@ ining reti@@ re@@ es .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not integrated in the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Zentrum für Neue Wirtschaft , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without a party state with a focus on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a vast restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from outside , measures imposed on the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens are refused to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration gave the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

artists and writers know the work of the mis@@ leading Syrian developer B@@ sel Saf@@ adi
Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ oura .
photo of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page from N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi Saf@@ adi .
the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been mixed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made to an open net . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture that is oriented in Berlin , devoted to an event of # Free@@ Bas@@ ed campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , business@@ leader in Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of articles produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints , excer@@ pts from the book C@@ ost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive enquiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here on licence @-@ free , contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for open knowledge are built and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working on page to look over the fog , who surround our newsletter and to make some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and respected Internet volunteers , which has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of Ad@@ ra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information whatsoever about his current state or residence .
the introductory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
to see how bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what did we decide ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody since March 2012 in custody .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military institution , transferred to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and attorney N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; drawn command from his cell in Ad@@ ra had taken . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration and expressed it from an alleged death battle against her husband .
his place of stay and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , it played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment , the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que cultural prototypes were pre@@ viewed as the work he began with a group of arche@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the elimination of numerous civilizations and the Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after having started working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture that em@@ bo@@ died not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world .
this strike into the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time kap@@ sel that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
I was not able to conclude that this project has not yet been completed .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life for dre@@ aming of freedom and Bas@@ ed taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ ed brought me English even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read English well , write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other in@@ ders to write English , to write and speak English .

Moz@@ ambi@@ que : due to corruption corruption Director after prison release , on the forec@@ ast@@ hen@@ ing post
Mos@@ ambi@@ an re@@ acted by anger to a corruption accident , in which a government member returned after half his sentence in the workplace at the state apparatus , in which the corruption was committed .
it is about Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose advice Cam@@ ba@@ za stood between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately asked for his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on 19 April then .
in accordance with a statement by the General State Bar of the Republic , who subs@@ cribed the request , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ ba@@ za , again to refer to his old post as the company was not performing any discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ ation according to his detention .
however , many citizens do not matter well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integrated da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company , the director returns :
represents an envelope in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
what we take note is that even the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ gues against the em@@ itting war@@ dly .
however , the company appears apparently and prompted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , reject this behavior likewise and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vile &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to an prison sentence , and which the half has fallen .
he might have paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and his image to polish .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has entered into the company re@@ integrated , which he could cause harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is going to be paid for his silence .
contradi@@ ct@@ ory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , Young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and Student der Political Sciences in Brazil says , the director no morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he def@@ aul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already conquered the state as massive .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks moral to return and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead of serving himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as handmade by an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself is we@@ ary of this man who was loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te fav@@ es the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remember that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
Di@@ ebe belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only as the first independent President , but also as a sharp , tri@@ mmer , and - next to proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was when he had energetic , that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of selling even the fa@@ ther@@ land for its ambitions , to sell its own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics but it does not change from its ambitions .
an ambitious human being is a crime . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also rejected :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down 10 years and came free .
and today it sets the company , in which he funds in@@ tre@@ ad , again among the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - consisted of : ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users to injustice
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means lap@@ wings or di@@ gest@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network recorded their posts from the net , because it enth@@ used the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ rough the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( in the m@@ esti@@ al font ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate @-@ language in Burma during the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements of the word has given an extremely dis@@ closing con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically retri@@ eved to hate .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his usage .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair added to Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; written , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( fl@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ y A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ ate explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he enth@@ used the word Kal@@ ar .
however he asked his friends on a spiritual way , whether they knew how he could soo@@ the his back pain by doing a word of words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + fra@@ gment ( la ) to Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that they will reduce the hate @-@ language radi@@ cal@@ ist Nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical and before it all the po@@ sts , that were in the suspici@@ on , racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the Automati@@ sm will not understand what you give to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( fl@@ age ) .
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread the hate language , a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all , the hate language is spreading , the efficiency of this strategy doesn &apos;t hold long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often will start a rubber and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ ate described , such as Facebook an@@ fing , to delete his po@@ sts , when he only gave to his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to accept the light , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook community standards did not ent@@ ail . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate @-@ speaking nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
in the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ or@@ se such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; builders &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they were not trying to correct the fal@@ si@@ cal po@@ sts .
if they had only some respect for the 15 million benefits , which had a great deal of turnover would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate @-@ language , to see whether their posts are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screenshots of fac@@ ets @-@ posts that have no hate speech , but nevertheless there were :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch her@@ edi@@ tary curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook is removed the post , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

scre@@ enshot with permission used .
in the last five years an extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate @-@ language in social networks inter@@ loc@@ ates violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , particularly in the area of Rak@@ ov@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have brought thousands of escape to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to critici@@ zed and critici@@ zed hate on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it would have better run on the context rather than on the code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Tr@@ ini@@ dad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the child @-@ before
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided that this practice has to offer , so that the mar@@ qu@@ ee of the age is at 18 .
prior to this change in the German law , some members held a du@@ ist and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ist Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state would not inter@@ fere with the fact that the state does not determine the maturity . &quot;
this happened regardless of the fact that Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights law , the min@@ ors being defined under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of the children who were married with 15 already in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago 2.4 per cent , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online Peti@@ tions and Social @-@ Media movements , which stri@@ ves to set laws for child @-@ before , followed at the foot and pleasing themselves great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u @-@ guides , for example had no concerns about the critics of the child @-@ before , they should do , dam@@ n &apos;t care for their own affairs . &quot;
this type of religious opposition cat@@ ered for tension in this actually uncomplicated matter , and eventually got doubts as to whether the opposition would not agree to the draft law .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law was decided against the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent who could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority could make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and preach the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle was re@@ posted to Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill draft against the child &apos;s before became in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for that and no single on it was decided on it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media user were thrilled , because the laws were finally changed to the child @-@ before .
Facebook @-@ Member Lo@@ vell Francis , who was a prime office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has been all too much time and unnecessary talk which per@@ ed the heart of the thing , but do you know what ? the child before is in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago now illegal , and this is almost worth every cost .
while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , there was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which said : , , Excellent news !
the law has been agreed .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! !
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which h@@ ears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that was quite open about it , how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the mar@@ qu@@ ee of age in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious con@@ fes@@ sions 18 years .
the draft for the amended law has been adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and there were 35 members of the vote .
all members working against them have voted for the law .
the to@@ e is legally not allowed in Tr@@ ini@@ dad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ age@@ .
many thanks to all activists who have read it .
congratulations .
a thank you to our Members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahead of months Mahar@@ aj has pro@@ claims his intention to undertake judicial steps , should the law be adopted , and he seems to be inviting his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the general state @-@ General Paris Al @-@ wi , a fe@@ eder of the law , argued that it would be quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would act against the law , the majority of social media users would like to tackle the issue differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear satellite , when we , instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we , to guard the state into our bedrooms , &quot; simply specifically talk about that the state , our daughters that may be mis@@ used to them , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s to@@ e are legally legal or continuing the norm although there are laws they say .

through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was shown on 18 January 2012 , contradi@@ ct@@ ory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the US , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has now been holding the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle on the crow@@ ned principle in Wikipedia .
day after day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful , as well as reliable information and sharing .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV series are opposed to the block@@ age .
although many techn@@ ologically beneficial Internet users are used to use conver@@ sions for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been un@@ locked in 2008 by Wikipedia , as recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China , Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ or@@ ship from Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be blocked , now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine @-@ computer connections ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is not available in spite of a legal ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reported about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) we put everything to remove sn@@ apshots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipe@@ di@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS was also confirmed that this step was independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation and is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ clo@@ th@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wi@@ ki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , when in the particular country is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ir@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices , as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ir@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one takes access to another URL that is not the original one . that which one then sees is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Ne@@ pal@@ es@@ ischer Wild@@ tier@@ photographer has used his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a remarkable rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with badly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colors .
the motiv@@ ate him to carry him a camera with himself and try to count the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nept@@ une leads to the international stage .
and his homeland right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Nept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook , how he helps him the first @-@ class position at his job :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I rested at home as I called suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that would be a leop@@ ard by the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately began to artic@@ ulate pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deepen the understanding of what wild animals are not as aw@@ ful how they look .
and he should know it because he was already standing tig@@ ers from face to face toward :
a tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he turns right away ; we look at it and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to make at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist arri@@ vals .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Volunte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing Convention .
in many parts of India it can avoid women with utmost care to utter@@ ance the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ omen or say &quot; Father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women give women to respect them due to the social pressure the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should be mis@@ used to maintain this practice in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a head@@ court and ch@@ ased by her family and the village community after they had addressed a married relatives .
the tradition her wives also does not call upon the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less chance to fear , if at all , they should not come to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and were thus fast to the main @-@ American topic of the city .
it is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ al Patri@@ arch@@ al .
as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volunte@@ ers and supports the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with the help of their video camera with the help of their video camera on the covering of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ men , and AIDS , and guides these clubs .
they told them how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and have made them simultaneously a ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini in her discussion round showed , was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
not to utter@@ ance the name of their hus@@ bands , is a bre@@ eder that all of them have been kept guilty and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who doesn &apos;t hold this is considered to be deposited , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is deeply rooted , that we have never thought about this discussion at all times .
at the beginning she wanted Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband to look at home , at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me around and said , I sol@@ le him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club .
many women had heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women were trying to start the discussion with a practice .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , loving , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , means that they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ths about the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women must never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini told :
a woman was so shy that she decided during the whole exercise just before lo@@ cher@@ ished ; another decided to allow the whole of frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adrenal@@ ine rush about it , having broken with an ancient customs , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she got fear and said that there was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less intel@@ li@@ gible and the situation de@@ activated in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports , how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing of galvan@@ ised point on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ inn@@ ate :
why do only women need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would bear the heart @-@ red dot , if he had it .
he took me only and I heard that to carry him .
the other women did not end up with it , but I think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip on every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who that could hear , &quot; she says .
in recent months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days in their lives for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things that they had never thought beforehand .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things , such as our identi@@ ties with our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only Sar@@ is for their marriage .
for most is the okay but some wanted a salad @-@ c@@ ta , a wide shirt above a p@@ ants , wear ; they have not entrusted themselves .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of our own clothes , mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , brave Roh@@ ini their own pair of tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so the women could wear them .
next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where you can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it .
on the question , whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed something , Gra@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have made only small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it yet , but only when they are alone and not any other family members .
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands . only one or two women now carry out Zin@@ no@@ d@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ oo@@ thing for more freedom of movement or the own clos@@ eness - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that will change something .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reported other people about what we talk and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of gl@@ amor@@ ous persons for the Organ@@ iz@@ ers , probably for super@@ sti@@ ff purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the Prak@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ le , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed , and some of the organs have been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently stressed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are exploited .
it give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a gl@@ amor@@ ous man can bring gold sof@@ tly or wealth , the police spokes@@ person stated by Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia on the BBC .
it is the first time that consecutive attacks on gl@@ amor@@ ous men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the target of assass@@ ination for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN launched a mission in the South African country to examine these Prak@@ tik .
the persecution of people with alco@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighboring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who want to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are travelling with Moz@@ ambi@@ que men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are aim of ritual attack , war@@ med the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police according to the latest assass@@ ination of three gl@@ amor@@ ous men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ le , where the assass@@ ination were arrested .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Alg@@ y Adam@@ o , Student and residents of the City of In@@ ham@@ mer@@ in south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , said the local police already said :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of gl@@ aci@@ ones men .
the persecution and murder of gl@@ amor@@ ous individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ah , for probably aber@@ glass rituals , has existed for the police of the Republic of Mos@@ ambi@@ que into consideration ( PR@@ M ) which also indicates that a faith existed , according to the victims of the head , the riches generated .
in recent days , three men have killed with hair removal problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ ggers Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , which Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces :
I would like to be ashamed of a country in which the people were ashamed to go down on the street , while the teachers would be ashamed to give sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation where people would not hurt themselves or even their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ amor@@ ous for aber@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to flour@@ ish to flour@@ ish wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some have left the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ia humor .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that probably has been made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 , in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of det@@ ain@@ ted Chinese dis@@ sid@@ ents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his Adv@@ oc@@ ate was announced at the end of June that he was delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the end stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of government ) , following the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to which the democratic reforms had filed in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; and a spokes@@ man told it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless China continues to call for calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ eing or allow him to act abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely removable .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
pointer R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese official to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be a treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway of Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ing have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into Sto@@ cks after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government did not tell that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to restore the sal@@ mon to China since 2010 , since exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
once the news was dissemin@@ ated that Li@@ u was seriously damaged , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release on unconditional release and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to its adher@@ ing , it was not able to counter its price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision on which China was asked to free Li@@ u , and his wife immediately from the house arrest , and permit him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China for the release of Li@@ us on how they divided into a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife as well as relatives .
they shall meet all the visits and receive them that they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
us @-@ Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans said to him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in so far as it would help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary and Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on 27 June , that the message will not release the Chinese authorities to free only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from its house arrest .
the challenge of the U.S. Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and un@@ answered reports on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple :
to protect and freedom such as travel free movement and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to move Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally , so that he can get into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bitter medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government speaker St@@ effen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u received all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters that China had big concerns if the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um invited China to provide an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to make sure of his family .
Li@@ us An@@ walt told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia who could visit him every day but the police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not allowed to talk to someone outside , including its lawyers , speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls for China to protect its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , true and liber@@ ating for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France
France &apos;s State Department called for China in an Declaration on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments which he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news sender France Info already reported that the French government called Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France will eventually receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of permanent affairs in Taiwan urged China on June 27 to release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to demonstrate a greater tolerance to those seeking peaceful means for political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ta@@ iw@@ an@@ ese legis@@ lators of Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Development Party , China also called on to allow China to treat the cran@@ ks of intellectual Li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed Himself in a statement on 28 June to Li@@ u very concerned and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had strictly pun@@ ished , to a harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
licence : C@@ C@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem fool@@ ed since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am should be considered as a city in Singapore .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Law@@ yers the State of New York , the Ministers agreed that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because in Singapore they compared with other countries .
he support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody asked question whether New York is a democracy ...
this is because most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot@@ ate the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and inv@@ itations to create this valuable land , you can say that we ultimately not be a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , eat country is it then ?
the reasons led by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of it , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reached the core point of the subject , the good old body appears from the author@@ itarian fe@@ asi@@ bility to be the Democrats , the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
during the last week of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , the answers to his American guests were given regarding our press , our jubil@@ atives , our political system really non @-@ answers .
- asked appropriate questions with non @-@ answers rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to make his mind clear , since it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low it .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city is , in which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our fabulous K Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid up in order to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking on the blog his comment , he points to the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the instructions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so uneven , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he signed Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has obviously not meant to be in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , who is acting as the leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very much ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - be with them or not , but this is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is really believes and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review presents the weaknesses of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ ams argum@@ entation :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher verb ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
as it plays an important role within the government of government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am are of severe importance .
why do they afford their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
whom must our Prime Minister pay its bills ?
what is the value of our pink human resources ?
is we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have been anno@@ yed by lots of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation is taking place , it is deemed to be polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by putting personal questions .
on my clari@@ fications then mostly the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly in front of anger , if they are held for Americans but don &apos;t distur@@ b me that .
for someone who does not know , there is little that differs us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans stand a Canadian flag well visible in their back@@ pack if they are travelling .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
that &apos;s how I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tru@@ mp , before the march in Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le blades at their luggage to be distinguished from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
with us there are no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are courteous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is supposed to be regarded as the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends who I appreciated very much .
I &apos;d like to tell me nothing if one would change myself with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , said : as &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be too big - as is the ben@@ ch@@ iness , gentle , but portable un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &apos; ( which has one &apos;s own Canadian dual @-@ go@@ ers ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter .
harmless to be harmless is un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remote from the things that happen around one .
I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main standpoint of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ standing as &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans not often talk about the fence along with the neighbors .
we are missing the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Jus@@ tin Tru@@ de@@ au the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has led Canada to sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video that govern@@ s the Jun@@ ta which 2014 took power and restore the civil government in spite of its ple@@ dge to continue the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about which rules his girlfriend do .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers directly to the continued military power of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other websites for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video posted on Facebook of the uploaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists urge the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ particular about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these recordings of the video to refer to some of the political issues that Thailand per@@ sec@@ uted in the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ making of the army absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous programme to &quot; setup change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are seen by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to advocate activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit has been set up in the army , supervised online content and persons , which is accused , the monarchy will have tri@@ pled to prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets a strike against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic flight ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems which the Jun@@ ta continues per@@ sec@@ uted , is their decision to buy expensive U boats , although safety experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax funds .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black side@@ d@@ car before one brings them into an interval storage , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and cy@@ c@@ ers will be threatened for a long time , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser showed the song &apos;s members of the band that was used the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , who was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests of 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the s@@ ni@@ cities in eastern Asia @-@ Asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the district T@@ spher@@ ical .
it has been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ astic War was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the deser@@ ted villages in the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Pol@@ ana and Khar@@ kov are in the carbon pool of Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ an .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area together .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part Russians and barriers are living in the area .
such settlements are also called fi@@ bers towns in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10.000 people today , today there are only a few hundred people living in these v@@ ster@@ cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely had risen over a decade .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty @-@ story housing of the Soviet Union from the early 60@@ s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ k@@ ow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it turns him hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
it is still clear . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens that served all the community .
now there are only paved road with f@@ aded glory @-@ buildings .
the people who lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the violin town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the chron@@ icles which are still living one or two families one can recognize on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she re@@ discover me with the camera in the hand , they will go back immediately .
&quot; our mother is forbidden that we let ourselves photograph , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend anything to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as livestock farming , bee @-@ keeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get about the rounds .
the district management system provides free candles and bread in the winter throughout the winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago , an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya ) , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle han@@ tu@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents have just nine dollars .
&quot; if you haven &apos;t a vegetable garden or a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; gives them too .
a@@ unt G@@ alya is told that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is concerned with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , there is a younger neigh@@ bor on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; Our Lady calls her to . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as talks with Nat@@ asha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she is remin@@ is@@ cent of the village of thorns before the war .
despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ al@@ asia broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we have recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative cat@@ er@@ cat@@ town in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ asha receives about $ 9 children for every child .
your man works in the K@@ ohl@@ eng@@ a .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as Kindergarten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that there was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first , as many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation turns to the end , a little boy had gone by us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy j@@ agt .
he plays with the ball , which flow@@ ed down the hill .
a group of children are now scre@@ aming the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the dec@@ ayed building .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for in@@ descri@@ b@@ ness in their lives .
they do not know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses &quot; migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ ery and gol@@ d@@ colored ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ären form .
it is called Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian who are on the transit .
the hotel rather has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with cold , very cru@@ mb@@ ling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ tian migrants are here .
sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
it does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medication they can not pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston , to find her husband and three children .
you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells you that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the track and that Afri@@ cans speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his companions made Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance , and has worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he has started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again , &quot; he smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you their guests to send their own text messages if they went away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian Faith was the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought it to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were added in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants will be sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep in blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he told . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
having lived three years ago he was reported after a raid on his work place of the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to his wife with his wife and three children who wanted to redeem money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for a accommodation and a unknown , an all @-@ known , has offered him their roof .
some months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the course of the course , the travelers calm their phones .
a minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she we@@ ed her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair@@ pin that you have made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ kids and many travellers more , boy and Old .
she laughs , while she puts it briefly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ eron &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeated it each time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install on their phones a surveillance app .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , made up of it .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July the mobile phone users received a cell phone in Tian@@ shan District of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi , in which it indicates the District Government , a supervision app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that the app is said to have access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities should also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they have , shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private white chat group changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police that the app will evaluate the sources and the distribution routes of terrorists , together with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ese website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , of online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is meant to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers may be able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often no@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , de@@ ported ethnic minority regions as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as regular monitoring procedures .
this published on Twitter based Media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( Th@@ ro@@ de from Main@@ land China ) , the cens@@ ored news in China showed photos of a check@@ point , at the police officers the residents sel@@ fl@@ acci@@ dentally checked whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ es make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be det@@ ained for up to 10 days .
this is an envelope on technological development .
they have comp@@ elled the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by rest technology .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ro@@ pe@@ de from Main@@ land China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift up a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a response to the instructions of the City Council , to minim@@ ise the dissemination of illegal contents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all governmental entities , authorities and the associated institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American human rights organisation , mentioned also these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi . a regulation with the instruction to all the inhabitants and entrepreneurs , until August 1 their &quot; personal ID maps , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; can register with the local police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; . however , this action is infr@@ inging the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible rates , including those which refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything crying to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has his experiences in a Syrian war .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar that you are completely alone in one place where all the Import@@ ant has disappeared .
everything has gradually resolved and reveals a truth that is clearly recognizable , both inside and outside .
one that makes their name all glory .
one which has turned down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you get the reality again and you behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ s , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and everything seemed to death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the we@@ dge . you will realise that you have caught here between the walls , that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this is not yet so I &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Trust it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he set his power over us by having even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protests .
it eman@@ ates from so that the city carried the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all city districts cov@@ eted , just my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ aining the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on one city , which has been assigned to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their complic@@ ity .
in the third night things had a little comfor@@ ted after the power supply in the district stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by turning several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of my house @-@ roof , crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through silence resist@@ ed .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we f@@ aded us to a beautiful image that ful@@ fills my expectations fully .
in such a moment you are aware that you are free to get the mind from the lamp but it &apos;s just not interested in the bar@@ gaining .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low , nothing can return your voice after you have caught it all the way up to the office of the safety service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as thou shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ ahu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only then brave enough to cry if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his bright eyes were standing on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really mour@@ n what to look in the eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was on my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so secure to me when I said , &quot; I would not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceas@@ ed to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest time that such fatal consequences could have for me , and yet I rep@@ ent not a word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies in single and his father as equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to this . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this curse set me up to the present day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an emotional torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I terri@@ fy the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I took with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a hallway to the individual cells .
I &apos;d like to give me all the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise than usual they might have shared a bigger cell at this time .
I have to share it with only one single det@@ ain@@ ees and may immediately stop myself , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I hold on a well @-@ proven communication method : to hit the wall against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my Z@@ H@@ ellen@@ ic was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ sth@@ in@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he eventually answered me .
apparently , in no one of the surrounding cells lay a respectable man middle age , which sees me similar and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no mark@@ ers can be recognized on me , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are one of his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ators had assured me , they would be happy if I stay .
liar .
would I like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these cro@@ wing , which lab@@ elled to the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear them still &quot; All &quot; ahu &quot; scre@@ am . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the fri@@ ght , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black saw the color of ruin , until I saw the yellow light that exhibited us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; you are here to hear sounds . &quot;
this was the secret to protect against us : to protect the state security from us and to prevent the obli@@ que in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al map and they played the narrow eye @-@ field of its world view .
this is not a house , this is not a land ; it is a curse to call it coexistence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I supervised the audi@@ t@@ orium and tre@@ vel at Abu Ima@@ d , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to protest this diary and to protest on demonstrations which soon will find an end . &quot;
I rep@@ lied not .
I used to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to be pun@@ ished , although I did nothing to earn these punishment .
an punishment in all their variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the lovingly &quot; Gest@@ apo . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your scre@@ ams .
my fear fell on him not enough why they re@@ plac@@ eable the pipe through a cable .
when my first trip I asked myself whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage dump , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment .
they had got four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the ones from their view , great invention of a giant cable .
within one hour three of them rarely changed from them , while I was still on the line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and found no vessel at all , which is why he accessed as neighbour@@ ly for an electri@@ fied stone .
stream flow@@ ed my entire body , enough to store my entire quarter .
my semi @-@ bare body that lay on the ground was the perfect electricity companion .
the num@@ b@@ ness of van@@ ity and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been so around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an exhaustive young boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must make fri@@ ghtful worry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk away , you will be displ@@ aced . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he loops to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but to what you can rely , a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine g@@ imm@@ ed lips to discover .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank and met H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ low@@ ye@@ a ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) .
since six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who poses the conservative majority and asks their old proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ids .
with his music , which often deals with issues such as Oriental alism , racism and the situation of the Palestinian Arab world . all these issues are not only enough in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that are enough from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by borders , and it can have according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not give it openly , he turns against the US American foreign policy a special dis@@ incl@@ ination .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war areas , something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; to do , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think of my own life circumstances so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while in water sol@@ dered the stor@@ k nests in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset .
the Soviet law reveals that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam .
basically the sounds of hot coffee and the wa@@ ist of K@@ ent cigarette lighter in the nose is first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , above all if one thro@@ ws a look into the neighboring countries .
from therefore , you simply avo@@ ids basic things to do - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Jordan , had a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , already for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the islam@@ ic action of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual sides of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual sides of Ham@@ ed sensu@@ o , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP &amp; D spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition DI@@ MA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been canc@@ eled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the author . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also affir@@ m the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that constitutes the well @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a said the j@@ ord@@ ant people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is likely to be simply a shallow rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender standards to glue , he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ dominant sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly disgu@@ ised un@@ familiar woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless wives who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them .
in Jordan the number of &quot; volunteers &quot; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to the human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached their climax in 2016 ; however , the institutional infrastructure is lacking to the women who have become the victims tried to support Mor@@ ning or domestic violence .
according to a law on fragile control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner violence , &quot; at un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for its release is often a long @-@ bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman is going to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also do not shy away from issues that are in his country long as tab@@ ular .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b pen@@ ises that his work is political , it adm@@ its that he is his music , the full explicit acceptance on sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Mann .
I became a policy @-@ get@@ t , &quot; says he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are in the core of politics can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ ai@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and any other one is also . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ believe H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were greatly cens@@ ored up in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b took an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ al Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , later to remember that his comments had been torn out of the context , and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts but was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b bu@@ ys open to the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexu@@ als do not talk to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in mind today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks herself : if Abu Nu@@ what was to work later once on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ sting , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality could write about homosexu@@ ality , why can the Jord@@ anian parliament not ?
the real problem , so h@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new more that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being sil@@ enced .
even recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ al news , took several former government and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they would have expressed critical about the problems in social media , which coinci@@ des with the deep in the land ro@@ oting corruption .
in view of that , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs believe only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to indu@@ ce a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks like h@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , practical and internal changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the Venetian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dream@@ y not only to bring his work until Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be fascinated by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , streams and on artificial art about guided democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
until it is , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and consequently also to res@@ ist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one thought it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory suggests that the fes@@ tivities , the drums and the dance over more than one thousand years have been floo@@ ded in the nor@@ theastern region to force the indigenous people of the region , the Em@@ ishi to impose on her knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could catch a few great seats , so we got a super view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have long been looking for the me@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fe@@ asts are straight to see .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and yet to spend a breathtaking way of spending his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meters high feast was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help keep away the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the one of the hair@@ dres@@ ses .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street ro@@ b and illegal drugs are all daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel secure .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Brazil ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to that more and more norm@@ al@@ aci@@ ers in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can make these elaborate hair@@ styles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme boundaries of imagination and creativity , has even been inspired by an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are experts in order to show each other who can create the ec@@ cent@@ red L@@ ooks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to gain their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and receive training in the hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the offers of do@@ zens of young people saw that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported on some of their successes :
1995 we were the only professional school in the church and the district , where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love to guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the post message &quot; love message on guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write love to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel united to offer affection ?
exactly this question proce@@ eded the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the Stiftung Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Youth Foundation , no more from the head and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Re@@ conci@@ li@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) to write young people to write guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare .
only recently , her country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla war against the guer@@ ri@@ lla war against the guer@@ ri@@ lla war against the guer@@ ri@@ lla war in Latin America .
international was the under@@ statement of the peace contract as so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos was awarded for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize .
but in front of the Colom@@ bian people , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that had been exposed to illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , and carried out their weapons with themselves , have now to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare , has to record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that young Colum@@ bi@@ ans have to come together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love @-@ message to former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the Camp@@ a@@ ign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare - to be handed over personally .
the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters of reconciliation emerged on the world Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , who took place in Bogot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2014 .
this stated that we love the man who we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day &apos;s thousands of love to write , but those forget that they need much unnecessary .
he plan , he told us to share his love with people this year , the most urgent need .
so the plan was to write with letters full of hope and support for former fighters of F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ co and Bogot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogot@@ a are in the camp to transmit the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were so on how they had done it before in order to prevent the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of under@@ protection of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the policy @-@ knowing Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had given the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa @-@ fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ds &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare ) saw , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla warfare that wrote a little .
I was afraid to go down , because in addition to it on the bed was a m@@ GL @-@ gran@@ at@@ laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the village .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said it anyway , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone has written for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eless letter .
never in my life someone was written something so nice , so I reply to it . I suddenly ran the tears across the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him firmly and set me next to the pom@@ eg@@ lights .
perhaps he was sorry , was sorry , to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault .
but now I know that there is a society outside there , which awaits us with open arms .
until now I learned just how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace is reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
fortunately , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion .
the students had grown up all grew up as a war and the F@@ ARC already worked in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years have experienced how the social injustice through the whole Colom@@ bian people came out . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country .
for a goal of this scale , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard before and no electoral law , and to realize that people who have often seen as a mon@@ ster and even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings were turned around , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the land lives , does me hurt .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused to teach us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian species was marked that after the dis@@ armament would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to protest to the weapons and protest for their rights . and this is also totally justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we of the F@@ ARC now put on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong to it - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mailing .
with fri@@ ght , activists have experienced the coverage of the last few months about the persecution of the men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that such as a D@@ amo@@ is worth over the dor@@ sal LGB@@ T@@ Q community depends not only on night .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman of Great W@@ ny who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us about what happens in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published , the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya V@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the susp@@ icious men Festival and they were hidden in secret pr@@ isons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ former , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they were born , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ et@@ een experienced by the sex @-@ simultaneous their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
they were afraid of their lives in the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as an honorary hel@@ per on a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone took my help .
it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a Trans@@ former who put into trouble in trouble .
she had no money , so I took them without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone made of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his t@@ sch@@ et@@ os@@ hen@@ ian friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
then the photos of my documents made by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
while I was just doing a few shopping bag from the back of my car , I heard a male vote : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned my mind , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence but this time on t@@ sch@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to honor the family , du Sch@@ and@@ bl@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had gotten everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two keywords in my right al@@ erts .
OC Media : in which cas@@ ements were you placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor got up and laid me on the women .
so I am very grateful .
when I read his name for the first time in his brush , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
the required to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they set absurd some demands : some said to me , I must prove it by being at the top without going through the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny , and say that I had not changed my sex that all was only bad speech , and Photoshop .
I have gra@@ af @-@ size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that has not only ashamed your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can not stir you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed himself a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbours were coming and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with kno@@ cked shut@@ ters and a number@@ ing plate with a 95 dr@@ on .
having happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human right friends audi@@ ts the num@@ eric signs - it turned out that I was prosec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you have flown ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something unusual .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registration without any ID , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
came on and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put up the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to invo@@ ke my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; you do not think about , you are in security , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you st@@ ay@@ st . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we are not talking about the gender equality , that is a sp@@ ook@@ topic .
some traditional ca@@ sian elements I still carry in me .
so much I also wish , these past@@ oral barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give me the effort to look like the person they remember from their past - so in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ ff ?
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed current information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke with someone who has fed the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely , they are now focusing on family and relatives .
that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret certificates ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there was not very many .
if , then mainly those who have no rich relatives , or who were left by their relatives to place Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : should they be turned to show her body on television and claim , they would have attacked your village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged to radi@@ ate themselves .
OC Media : is this only one failure or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there have been nothing new of them .
they have they simply taken away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was self @-@ evident than these people were taken away .
until now , they were not presented as a ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise would you not have allowed this man to shave ?
do you know if this per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think earlier in 2003 I was already well @-@ known as I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was held , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia was originally forced to lead us to the &quot; civilians &quot; , but eventually sent us back to the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were pressed ; I had colored lashes , carried the tube , and short bapti@@ ops .
the security of the sh@@ aria has never curved to me only one hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been ins@@ ulting .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is said , &quot; Sp@@ otte does not talk about the un@@ happiness of another . &quot;
it often says it to children when they make up about sick .
OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulting , never hun@@ ted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this gr@@ aces change ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to speak on television via morality .
he did not talk about us , but primarily on the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people began to change in the city .
he who sm@@ iles and had suffered , consider yourself with suspici@@ on , at one time with suspici@@ on .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I got back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly wast@@ ed .
OC Media : what kind of activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still working as a activ@@ ist .
at present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , compositions , I beg@@ ining them to the hospital and help them to get f@@ isher again .
I do not have a pen@@ ny for them .
I discovered these people themselves when I kl@@ ed shelter .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you carry a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is interesting .
so the nature that has nothing to do with religion at all .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya that would proph@@ esi@@ ed to you with foam before the mouth , that there are no sw@@ ings with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have who , the Kab@@ ard@@ iner , who have the Russians , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the whole planet there is - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m from there , that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know many thinking about transi@@ identity to men , men love , and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a tru@@ thful .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling in order to be exact , different ways of living .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will personally become so personally but my last intimate relationship is already last longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab A@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase of self @-@ murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man by J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August backward the dist@@ res@@ sing situation of the Arab A@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had one child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he bu@@ ys for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that can arise for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had landed himself .
some people managed to delete the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ators were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists on the site warn of that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ h Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - are distinguished .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family @-@ fathers that felt helpl@@ ess , due to persecution on the part of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ able to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab A@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab A@@ w@@ az@@ i community is located , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to pun@@ ish their livel@@ i@@ hood .
a century ago the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and 1925 major efforts to end the ethnic autonomy in all Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran nuclear and gas fields , as well as some of the most successful and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to grow slow , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , which lie water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region through drying , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , completed a school , 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ himi , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among the young A@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
Do@@ himi said that especially the unemployment has become worse recently . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z @-@ new ethnic per@@ ches and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
being functional and institutions preferred non @-@ Arab labour , the local Arab A@@ w@@ az@@ i shall have access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside of their homeland .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , and to become so put , since even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because speaking the Arabic language or the wearing Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances that have to endure the Arab A@@ w@@ az@@ i , strike human rights defen@@ ders alarm , before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is watching and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identifying identification with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ se@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions have been expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , react many women - especially white women who call themselves as an inter@@ direc@@ tional fem@@ inists - with frustration .
you wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all the femin@@ ist * within .
for example , women today still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass blan@@ ket , and that discrimination based on sex are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I stayed double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I talk on skin color , on black CIS women , on black CIS women , on black and black women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora ; if I speak , on which way we have been physically , mentally and verbal abuse , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ se@@ tional fem@@ inists are not to be silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but nevertheless , all the agreed that women - all women - should come together to lift up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their voices and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to reach my Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reach equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and origin resorts earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are referred to as a white girl with a migration background as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black and women with a migration background , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as the white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men any skin colour have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join me as a black woman whose centre is the white woman who refuse to take into account both the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere , which still rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner be@@ aten in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a humane and margin@@ alized nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to connect myself group@@ ings which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs to drive their ego@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will no longer try to seek white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them of a better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the corporate @-@ direc@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different arri@@ vals a home and diver@@ t from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I prefer to get rid of me full of femin@@ ism and join me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of putting me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm , which is so in@@ sist@@ ent that interaction is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
it is more important than ever before that we define black women with our own ideas and set us into the spheres , created by us for us .
Cl@@ an Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing proves ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , by defining us in our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered one of the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ se@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately will call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am acknowledged because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can b@@ lossom in an environment where my life is not b@@ yp@@ ed , nor ignored , yet rejected .
pad@@ del@@ ating against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations

this article will be published once again as part of a content sharing agreement .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled in the past 7 years - usually with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern due to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution to His church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of cru@@ mbs , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - an affiliate of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq and a multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and edited .

Paraguay &apos;s Women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The cri@@ es women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents their pain about the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ consuming ) that reports on the threads of women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the persons concerned .
a police Commissioner said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she has nothing to do against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their ex@@ partners who had become violent towards violence .
since the end of her relationship was some time passed and the police said , their statement would be placed to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of distr@@ acting , the ac@@ ten@@ ant display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is also useful .
a few days later , the second woman moved to her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are concerned at all times , they do not receive any support from the state in general .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men who mis@@ ses them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence to be aware at all in law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ er 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 Inv@@ isible Mission@@ aries and a legal system that nothing sub@@ ni@@ mm@@ ed 3 Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , def@@ ective implementation beats and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mis@@ directed , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for genius questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports , which however do not even ans@@ at@@ ed@@ ise the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains her .
the available numbers are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 at the District State Bar 9@@ 600 ads went for domestic violence . at 70 % of this it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there have been more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace geri@@ es . also here 86 % of the ads came from women .
in the ads said 40 % of women , that they were physically comp@@ elled , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women of Minister of Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on any woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , come 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who will be refunded because of physical abuse , are two women who do not do this , &quot; explained them end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s genocide in Paraguay has no own crimes , the prosecution authorities cannot document properly , how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
only until August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies because of violence through men .

invisible distr@@ actions and a legal system that does not under@@ takes anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name to him all her former friends .
in the beginning they didn &apos;t want it , but then after . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer coinci@@ ded with Carlos . but two years she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognis@@ able the most severe :
I have never thought I would become victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that that only women had happened to be sub@@ servi@@ ently because they are dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen that .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ical , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and not left him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say the victims of abuse at least to have a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos that did not originate from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is susp@@ ect her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te C@@ RE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way sacrifice of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner finally got it to persu@@ ade them that it was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays at the authorities were without a result and also by their relatives , they received no support .
it carried out a process against their former partners who developed into an un@@ clear legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , def@@ icient implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a struggle against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen liz@@ ard , a representative of the UN @-@ Organisation for Women in Paraguay , looks also great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill design was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # ession ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ Un@@ less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original design of the law reveals to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal statement and to be harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in some points , in order to also win the MEPs in favour of the law that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions will be denied which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ished up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill design had envisaged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which have to carry the victims of violence themselves , if they just want to report and receive a secure accommodation to surrender to the state .
echo argued that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lat@@ ure does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , distr@@ action is seen as a part of human relationships .
here a re@@ think has to take place , so that violence is no longer considered as a little Nor@@ mal .
whoever deals with this facts makes it guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators of the perpetrators .
we need to report as long ad until distr@@ action does not apply more than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an Sen@@ at . previously , parts of the law had been changed , but among other things , a passage was painted , which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , to once again interven@@ e .
the deletion of words &quot; gender , &quot; political force , &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , applies as a great envelope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which reports on the threads of women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most names were changed for the protection of the persons concerned .
independent media in O@@ man remains exposed to a newspaper after ban on a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the Information Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is published on the homepage of the Forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues in prison , where he is in prison .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and made to court , but later returned .
O@@ man has been governed since 1970 by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having set his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a state of state .
since then , he dressed , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the main mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , ruler of the Defence Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is characterized by the per@@ sever@@ ity efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic law , including freedom of government , including freedom of freedom , including press freedom , blo@@ ggers , and other activists to de@@ duce , intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ained .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically opposed and hin@@ ders citizens , activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the detention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , was published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands of the judiciary . in this it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused , judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to raise a verdi@@ ct on an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , he was a member of the Board of Directors , charged the ISS prior to the Special Department and transferred to his arrival by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 the ISS took the assistant of the assistant of You@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acts to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
the paper was closed at any given time after the Minister of Information gave the statement , that &quot; the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial was held at Silhouette the first hearing in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court condemned the three journalists to pr@@ isons , and numbered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned among other things because of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ ordination of the press of the State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was beyond the violation of a publication and s@@ lan@@ der for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of arrest and money la@@ under@@ ing in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year veter@@ an agreement was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and an average of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after the use of &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a deposit was established in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was already released on 22 August 2016 before the Court of Jud@@ gement .
the Appe@@ al Court spoke al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , he condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months of prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the rep@@ ay@@ ment of his six @-@ month prison sentence in the centr@@ al@@ ous prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he is in prison .
the Appe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself as before attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information granted a statement by which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister gave up a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the minister announced another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to resume the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in O@@ man in recent times the press freedom has been violated .
further injury count for example the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the adher@@ ing of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ ó@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally free ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can go to their work ;
3 . protecting the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights defence and journalists in O@@ man have un@@ hin@@ ders their ri@@ ghtful human rights work and without fear of conce@@ als , including judicial systems , can exercise .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defence ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring states through the promotion of opinion and association and the right to gather peaceful , supported and protects them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need on @-@ run medical research there are two reasons : there are many medicines and vaccines that are lacking in the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria in the poorest countries are far more serious than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the exploration of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , establishing own research capacity in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it warri@@ ors is director of the Central Market at the Center for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic &apos;s first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself explored the HIV virus , before he decided to go home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media about this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors R@@ W : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ pled national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also star@@ ving a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important current sciences topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being m@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the finance and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well funded .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work , which you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should they focus and how can we support the development ?
R@@ W : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
G@@ V : can you describe us the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
r@@ w : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the easy access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that journals can only make payment accessible ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of availability information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed produces world food production
this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solving possibilities for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton were bre@@ d in the USA for the 1980s .
its enterprise offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant cultivated by NASA A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in Space and consumed .
almost 20 years Mor@@ tons &apos;s work was released only by its own down@@ turn and the question of how many sal@@ ut@@ ors he can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he re@@ marked that more sal@@ ads have been patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual sorts , but also for certain properties like w@@ att@@ age against diseases , a special red or green tone or off@@ ended leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants such as grain and cart@@ on sites . due to these trends , plant breeders are worried , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts about food safety for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition bre@@ d Mor@@ ton still salad , he now needs to last longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more constraints .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is , as would lie down a rock in a river to triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must do that now , but it is a rup@@ ture with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far from sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they with@@ stand judgment , no one can grow a new sal@@ at@@ ype , because all the features are already patented , so as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics which he wants .
however , he is very careful and tried to use no material protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the U.S. and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International indoor station ISS have bre@@ d red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested , whether plants can be grown in space .

it &apos;s no coincidence that this name sounds rather than would the movement originate from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software .
it was launched to make sure that some plant species and genic are not being protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , the US breeders can commit themselves to use that others are able to use seed freely freely .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed , and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders merely allow others to breed their seed , to breeding it , and it will not immediately rin@@ se - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant producers .
do@@ zens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark views
for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg is control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement is not busy with gene@@ tically modified crops .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; who supplies good , locally and sustainable produc@@ tabl@@ ed vegetables , should also know that the way it is bre@@ d for example , should also know how this vegetables is bre@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nutritional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nutri@@ tion@@ alism without seed are not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing others their seed will continue to be available freely . this is how its action is in contrast to the plant , seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , since the available genital pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on the plant material which is thus always reduced , inc@@ ess@@ ly shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , executive director of the Os@@ si , has worked in their doctoral thesis with gene@@ tical variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all the cart@@ ography are protected as intellectual property , making it available for plant breeders either at all or only .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ grown plants like wheat in still bigger style are patented as salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bre@@ d that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their taste or colour improves down to such , due to which they thri@@ ve into certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders through more and more patents decreases . genetic diversity is now worse than ever since the changing conditions are much worse by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker in Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property has other breeders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ effects innovations will promote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that every one can follow once the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions are helping others with another method to get the same result .
such protection is not in@@ hi@@ bits innovation , but it promotes the public more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees what is different : 20 years waiting until a patent is drawn , there is certainly no innovations .
and if you need to wait for such a long time to breeding plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions , the fight would have been lost .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers their job easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be made impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether , Mor@@ ton is bother@@ ing to apply to the concept itself , plant characteristics : &quot; we create the characteristics not really itself .
the plants do they themselves and as breeders , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant @-@ house in the US @-@ State Oregon and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ d a kind , bre@@ d even his own values in it .
those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ultur@@ es , are required for the cultivation of mass@@ ages , bre@@ d in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dirty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as are moving on international markets , but smaller than such as Mon@@ san@@ to are patents exist , there are most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either lean or keeping it for expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding @-@ garden sal@@ ads .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant producers of innovative would : &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies , the patent .
I need constant new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; says he . &quot; with a patent you have been around 20 years before competition , how to make it quite nice easily . &quot; global response
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept now spreads rapidly all over the world .
in India , the center for sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program works together with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organisation Agreement is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , while the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Officer of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the present practice of the European Patent Office , the patents on conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a declaration is not yet a law ; it is now in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from across Eastern Africa to experience something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed motion and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ ent@@ ment of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems declares that the organization is now to drop a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for the scheduled next year of the official start signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a federation of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a federation of aid organizations such as the w@@ k Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published . it represents that farmers have the opportunity to contribute to seed , to exchange and improve and improve the seed policy so that stable supply of food can be ensured .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is stressed - a connection , hopes that Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been focused on where and as something grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of the cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still they still lock the Egyptian authorities contents on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government had documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reported above all above .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook , in which it critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abi@@ des ; despite this attack and the mo@@ ck of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which the law should defend to its goal , to cover freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never so important as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so important to overcome these objectives and do not give it . we insist that our task continues to fulfil .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web sites , such as b@@ split or independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the origin@@ ating network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of the alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ H@@ RI also exists on the blog of the Columbus and Human Rights , Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of Kolum@@ ba and articles that he does not write access websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to deal with the cens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of the blog &apos;s blog is native , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013 , while he reported on the Stud@@ enten@@ &apos;s protests and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed by the government and reflecting what this means for him :
the , blogs to lock is very old , however , has been priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs might not be significant for the world , so it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege of si@@ ege ; an arrest , a attempted murder , discharge at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I have not written in vain . in other words : my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles to deal with the cens@@ or@@ ship .
however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ g go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this gained technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ an .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , through the use of boarding facilities and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer , began .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that could have access to the Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation will be dra@@ ined in addition , that the cens@@ ors will be made behind closed doors , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed to the court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day , newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year old school shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Each second day a police officers in Rio de Janeiro killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Lu@@ so@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the British 2017 in Rio reached the highest level since 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice , even called the United Nations to interven@@ e .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16th August 2010 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where they announced a new category called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper as follows :
extra will continue to report about crimes that occur in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex dis@@ ruption , etc . everything , but what happens in Rio , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war .
in the same video a journalist of the newspaper declares that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than it used ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l argued the journalist of Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira on the other hand , to call the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of failed security policy through the media and could ag@@ grav@@ ate them accountable to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military power in Rio itself has shown - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and independent negle@@ ct of public service .
to remember : the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; is according to Cec@@ í@@ lia false : &quot; 22 of 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data .
none of these cities is located in the State of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the mines per federal state , Rio on position 16 , &quot; writes it .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company South America , that emphasises as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly repeated the security policy of the state for years .
among these safety @-@ political measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela through the use of a massive police record and to establish a unit permanently there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for several years , the U@@ PP was actually meant to protect several reports of ra@@ ils and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his fac@@ ebook page , journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war continues to be serious consequences for the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls on the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war . this belongs to the penetration into the territory of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collision strings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irrit@@ ated balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ elas remain in Rio continue to suffer .
a week it is now that the police rec@@ er@@ kl@@ ed the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to the death of a polic@@ eman .

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Sy@@ rer to plant fung@@ i
scre@@ enshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer under brutal attacks and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ ber@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ ei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the region is particularly affected by the East Gh@@ out@@ a region where an attack with chemical weapons took on the 21st of August 2013 .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that have been practi@@ sed by the mass@@ acre of Assad regime .
since 2013 , they have been stran@@ ded by the rebels outside of Damascus , which led to the fact that inhabitants depend on local people or through tunnels and control points .
due to the years of block@@ age , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to conventional , in Syria natural foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the bel@@ ated East gh@@ out@@ a .
the directive of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we chose cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reported Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fighting this project for three years , and expressed its relief that it gains more and more &quot; an acquaint@@ ance . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , take advantage in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to plant@@ ing mushrooms , such as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is instru@@ cted on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel scar@@ city locally produced fuel from plastic used to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production from the regions of pilgrims &quot; before they audi@@ ts their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small pilgri@@ m in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the East gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the fungus @-@ breeding for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ care by adding a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege becomes visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to be inspired in crisis @-@ areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese &apos;s call for justice to the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that take place in the north of Portugal .
two @-@ two people died , and about 70 were in@@ ju@@ red as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government was called for 3 days a stat@@ ute out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of Galicia , where there were 4 deaths .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fire@@ out@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country , about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande has been a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths across the fires and over 200 wounded .
according to the European forest control system , which monitors the forest area with satellite recordings , alone in Portugal in Portugal approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of Location : there is only in 4 districts not fire .
all of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - N@@ ata ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017
some of Twitter @-@ users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images , which allow better insights into the stolen :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy ...
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the call for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to in@@ dem@@ on the scale of the tragedy as much as possible .
João Sover@@ al by the federal government of the farmers of Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are d@@ ast@@ er@@ ous reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy as in June could happen again since the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high Bran@@ dr@@ isi@@ ko will be questioned .
a far @-@ sufficient proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which the government had brought in severe fires during the years 2003 and 2005 , was disp@@ uted by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a de@@ priv@@ ation of the law if the applicant might be permitted by means of self @-@ protection - this was an open back door , so that everything could be built &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; continues to Sor@@ val in the same Article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us made aware that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly burning wood , as well as in a devil circuit , to spread this type always further .
these problems arise that the website of civil protection from Portugal on 15th and 16th of October , when inhabitants searched or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the people with information : they used the own civilian protection data using the app fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the people in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers João Pina into being able to simplify the work of fire@@ men and was following this f@@ ateful weekend in October so decisive that the server per@@ sec@@ uted the 400@@ ,000 users who per@@ sec@@ uted , did not with@@ hold the website more than half a million access .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began through the Taliban .
two years previously , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ ine group@@ ings which had conquered the short@@ cut pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
right at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Bank to the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him into the locks .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hit@@ ara dom@@ ed Party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ soldier was just mur@@ dered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt prot@@ ection@@ able .
the Taliban sitting for their hatred at the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban were ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ ks found himself in Pakistan .
he worked for a couple of years in a carbon pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left out of his little wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with mort@@ ar , the he@@ avier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ i@@ hood .
at that time as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in a le@@ er@@ standing building on the construction site , on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating available there . we hanging n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we may not re@@ fr@@ active at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing to the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities had refused its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some time was ano@@ de@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy people .
it is true that Italy is due to relatively high availability quot@@ as a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers can be found in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Civil Rights Organisation for Europe writes , the system &quot; suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a entrance center , if they officially asked an application for asylum - which can still lead to asylum after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his un@@ cur@@ b CV helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years in construction in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k threw its entire savings in the creation of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that he opened after a while still opened a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ li@@ mb@@ iss .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians , are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies were created by Afgh@@ ans , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the servants and the chef are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari , opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
A@@ shar@@ ks &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y and the retail trade and aim back to the country , which he had to leave behind as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know that my people suff@@ ers .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest countries of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as anyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ k is also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people will be able to learn packaging and con@@ fes@@ sions . &quot; thus they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft law on which users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a governmental authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to use in order to use social networks , to be registered within six months after successful legislative decre@@ e on the website of the authority under giving its full name , as well as their identification number .
whoever pro@@ cured this step could be sentenced to six months to prison or to be sentenced to a criminal payment .
the law , which was advertis@@ ed by sixty members of the members , is currently under the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may , a further election proposal came into a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law the Bel@@ ran@@ gement of the President as well as government institutions are already criminal . however , under the law proposal , such a act would however be folded with j@@ ails and banknotes , so right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when it demonstrated against demonstr@@ ators , demonstrated against demonstr@@ ators that demonstrated against military coup , led to the minister of elected President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
