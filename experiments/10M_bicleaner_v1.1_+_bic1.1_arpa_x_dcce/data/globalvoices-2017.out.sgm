<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">As many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnet that was the top of the Supreme Court with judges, who were keen to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "mir was it, as if this is the absolute truth, everything else, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting you can always be that you are and it's easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love-letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump was born.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and the racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes round with his hand-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain on how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says what he thinks of how a former colleague express it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroUS and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won at the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number, which ever reached a party candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigest person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not associate Trump and his voters with the people whom I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of journalist, people from all over the world participates, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "moreover, Trumps worldview did not agree with the from Peter Bhatia, the current publishers of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Inintolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived at Sandy Bahr that fought their lives long, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It also fits with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values affected by them are their love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">During Trump his way to the nominee of the Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to its limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly pastes, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as a racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To submit people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most know are, for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who sees the cruel decision to make a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.): as much as "drawing of the White against all other ethnicities"; words from white in backlash on the whites and whiplash, what does the great Van Jones called, has exactly what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background one may still have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenya, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise, and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of wording with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud, no! "</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "fratly the amount." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "have Latino a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answer it.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called and their votes were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vocal and voiced 'NEIN'!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words, "God is thanks, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, "said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this leaves me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura jointly?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music that is played at both places not only has changed the life of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 odometer south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) plays an existing symphony orchestra, which has found an opportunity to overcome them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music-school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and banking violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and gave the youth such a seldom hopeless situation.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers take their obligations to the Musikgroup very seriously, does the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI editor:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to meet their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and playing with glossy eyes and play in the chest you will learn day for trumpet, trombone, trombone, Piccolo, Clarke, Clarke, Pauke, Bongo and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village which is practically located on the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are produced from re-controlled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recurring instruments, which consist of local fixed waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling led by Favio ChÃ¡vez in order to transform portions of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitating violins, violas, violins, flutes, saxophones, trombones, trombones, trombones, trombones, trombones, trombones and percussion.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local oologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the garbage, the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them don't live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a Favio something that he had never seen before: a made of waste produced in waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of refine material and called The Recycling Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation of "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance to:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights against illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was well-known that this ship had already been operated in Lebanese waters of illegal fishing, before it was looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore expressed and inclined to welcome a legislative breaker of this type on its shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Koms, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised himself against the ship. they occupy him, one of its harbours and refuse to give him a fishing place.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply" "" "remembers" "", "remembers of Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Policy. he is part of a team that discovered the ship at its time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries who at that time had driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. you exchange information and stand together when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, present because it is extremely difficult to catch up, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the obvious contempt of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystems can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdle and also by the snail, with the information between individual countries, so the actions occur today in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists existing licences, up-to-date activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port speculation.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move around the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. also allow yourself to discover so suspects driving routes - some such that indicate that a ship charges its floated fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies may show whether the ships involved have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries which are against illegal fishing boats, may refuse on the basis of such information in their ports. what does the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, meaning that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultation company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to win estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, who lose eight members of HISH-i each year due to the illegal fisherman who penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing centers, present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">To their practices include events such as sailing under falter flag, counterfeited licensing papers, indication of fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they targeted the lack of international cooperation and make up the weaknesses of a non-organized control system" "", "says Long." "" "she could not miss a ship illegally and a country could then say" You don't miss my port. "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks, which had counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and it has been tracked and found volved ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with Interpol, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing over great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations perform quite far into the networks organized by organised crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i, suspects ships precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to detach the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very ingenious techniques to hide their activities and their position, and that we try to cross through" "", "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be obtained by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects various information levels with each other. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually exert influence on this undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Protective Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data, and can be rendered worldwide by means of the position of every tracking ship all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this simply gives sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine its resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run on which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but they also scare deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which earlier without a license wfished and hardly expected with consequences, they now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in the meantime found a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats in order to buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia, Greko had helped to detach Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board tow, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

"" "security is the target, even more such initiatives and structures emerge also in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's most recent member states with his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under falter flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were used towing nets that are now forbidden.</seg>

<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorated continuously, which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuelans due to a acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition have been blocked by the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the chance of a fundamental change; ultimately, the posture of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>

<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined, which were committed during the Argentine military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the peasant, the same name as his father to carry up to the brutal military occupation in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15 he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of life for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years you don't notice that one is manipulated by his Father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendoweriepers. during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of State rorism, his father from 1976 to 1978, was his deputy director of the secrecy 141 in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. I had dressed myself with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All-called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black-white photo and called me to identify my friend to it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an arhole, you have wounded yourself with one of the ERP-friends.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only on that they don't have a day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionaries People - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers' Party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would become an oeffluent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had moved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy Papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propagan amaterial, books, simple everything.</seg>

<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, television, refrigerators - just all possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything about it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little into a blanket tilt bag and commanded me to wear it for the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Baracke where the stolen objects were completed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewn in and saw a lawn that were tortured on the people.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was buried there.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and myself became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To survive, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case of motherspeakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - will not be in the address language - mother tongue.</seg>
<seg id="379">In this way, a French native language should translate into French for example - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may be due to misunderstanding, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers that can learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that have even no foreign employees, make translations still use company internal. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge as the best to be judged, made for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worworrens and puzzling sentences arising from machine translation, show that this technique can't replace a long yet human translator. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including also the puzzling prints, often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>

<seg id="394">Other online transmitters of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositionists held by the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the Parliament's responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is connected, and recommended the Uusers, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitated since 2014 when reporting protests. at that time, the Commission for telecommunication to them with banknotes and lockers, if they continue to report on demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative TV channels I have registered myself at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Astonishing that this continues to be cheaper than two litre Limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIT filtro confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by a block of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also applies to the Internet site to which the National Assembly carries out its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous post-researches of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had the result of making use of local internet providers to stay at times. this is a technique by which the DNS server will respond to certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server is flawed or denied the request at the call of such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-locking: @ elillolotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third-cut channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live in custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police food.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on show again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections: thus the Venezuelans the access to multimedial reporting of the current events in the country is still more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned, however, is that the children need to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victim of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract which one cannot lift up.</seg>
<seg id="425">This act as Criadazgo, is widely used in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a period for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Crime, above all young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated to the Crime, guaranteed in general still.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family that her daughter is in faith, that she wants to complete their education, improving their position in society and make "something out of itself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family owned the girl and whose exploitation is justified by faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not get training, and perhaps even starved.</seg>

<seg id="460">In the house of her employer Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">In doing so, she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood there every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, cleanse the refrigerator, pants the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they have done with learning the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">However, this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she had never had hungry, but did not get an unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At several end-end of the host Alvarenga, next to him stand and editorial from opposition-newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give the reports of the official media over the regime of the dictator no faith.</seg>
<seg id="471">He kept them for intelligent, but not with her. "the landlord had found someone who listened to, while he spoke about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn there again" bad habits. "thus they said that Alvarenga belongs to the indigenous group of the ReasÃ­, home again their native Guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the formation, which they had made possible to lose again, explains her.</seg>
<seg id="474">But it was absolutely clear that she got paid for everything they got from them, with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school Alvarenga discriminated against that. "one thing that is almost never talked about, Mobbing and the Shikanen, which Criadians are exposed when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents, is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I had no friendships at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time, where friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The insulation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">Society asures the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which one can share job advertisements for cleaners and nanny in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administrators of the group is PEPA Kostianovsky, a city center in the district of Asuncion.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities defy the user and users' registration. it is also unclear how to account those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee Regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza shows in the video, "the Persian Leopard is the only surviving robbery in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predatory is present.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, which has been made in the north of Japan to rebuild the lives of those who have been affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and a atom crash in Fukushima disaster had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi, prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was the prefecture of Japan's north-northeast, both of which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring farmers Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuated, because the tsunami had spoilt whole coastal cities off the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more the prefecture of Fukushima still lived an atomic accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows which progress has been achieved six years after the life of the local community.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority as well as the survey results of those affected by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (Duescorkai kouei juutaku) was completed in the prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record Miyagi's biggest success, 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, while Fukushima, with 70 percent the final conclusion is.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one still endeavours to move even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated from Behelfsquu) in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in Behelage groups.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such Behausungen.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Evkushima still lives in emergency accommodation in 2011, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated income, which have been tricked according to the disaster in elelage, were tripled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">State of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools, which were hit by the unhappiness, their penned until December 2016 again, which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the construction of industrial reconstruction in the three prefecture is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbors in Iwate and Miyagi have now back in operation, Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing harbors are refine their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have been hollow in the three fectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with just 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic force, since only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed by Fukushima, located in the" nuclear wave "zone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism continued to recover again, but even here Fukushima still leaves far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before unhappiness. Fukushima on the other hand can have only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that since the disaster almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it is harder to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous interviews under the native population and under the evacuation. they asked them about the state of rebuilding and also how their empires has changed over the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey provided that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in matters of disasters-prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuated from the Prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In their issue to the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic accident, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to participate.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, there were more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in lasting spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 level of 2017 there are still 40 000 citizens of Fukushima off of their homeland prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation areas are most of the evacuation regions, older than 50 years old. they have to compete in proper comfort, because efforts to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. here, it is construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="627">The People Municipality of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque is generally known as the Central - in Spanish sugarmill - regardless of the fact that there is no noteworthy sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were put into the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the yield, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes rarely the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resins and commute daily to the factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, which is rising every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry did not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the east of the region sugar cane factories, who are back in operation after a long inactive period because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">It was something that he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers the fact that in MaÃ±ali would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry had already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are already no more novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugarbeers switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway stiff of the community saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and almost competitive they were irreportable in the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro) can produce.</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the rise rise on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased from about a decade back.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 until 2025, the price of ingenious sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 Report "Agricultural Engineering" by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the pipe export of roughly 85 million dollars for the country would work for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years the stagnation of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, is the word he repeating the most.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities in Canada are occupied with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of Hip Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour have been introducing mobile Tonstudios directly to schools and youth centers, in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants are involved in talks themes such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance, or whatever comes in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Akilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the day nurseries in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of the Highway 16, also "Highway of tears," a streak-section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were killed or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapskoostui Cree First Nation has taken, the chorus in Cree is sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received a little help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop group that gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookpage from N 'we Jinan is at your disposal the strophe in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like I wouldn't ever be interested in myself</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go further my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will forgive our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">That way they can grow and also lead to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what she determined the creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentant, the reader and feeder of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also has a post and adds the Strophe in Silbenign (which also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what exactly is placed on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokukpuru (state of the menu, "plastic models of the courts") from each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic courses.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the western part of Kappabashi there are a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes produced by German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic courses are as usual they are not even more striking to them. however, a new trend is turning it today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published by social media links and photographs, which show this unusual twist with the shohback sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on sale: new with plasma-based mobile phones, as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these contrived foods have turned to kitschy items, as in this case, refrigerated, magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shockling stove magnates for a new exhibition at Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essations is increasingly enlightened.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaisen-don (a popular travel bowl was turned into a mobile phone).</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to watch like an apple, with a candle for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile telephones and phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a favorite topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there is someone to say there:" "" "wow, cool, now I can distort my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic foods can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our newest mobile-struts has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further sculptural plastic dishes can be seen under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you insight into the district of Kappabashi dedicated to the Beliefering of the restaurant industry. such as with the shokukpurple restaurant.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in- and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trading" in Mexico, the missing and transmissions are regularly appearing in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy, which brings this struggle to itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the Chief of Sinaloa-Kartell, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict perfect in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a nonviolent incident, someone looks at the sorrow or the communities who learnt to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">They stand behind each body, behind each bone loss in the hundreds of inherited tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never be cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trading), which aims to give this sacrifice and stories of people told in the struggle between prosecution authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime cannot be used only for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities allow to drive many kilometres to buy something such as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video with the title" "" "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear life changed" "" ") just tells these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who is seeking a secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>

<seg id="771">You are aware of the insurance of my father, but that does not receive them out, because they require a treat.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where are we supposed to get? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprentia vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We don't just have to show the faces of those who are afraid of. we need to show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the government.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the State of Guerrero in Central Mexican.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and sensation journalism, I have been familiar with now for several years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I am passing each day to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures that actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the one, that disgusted or sad. it works, like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body once.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent to this or consider it normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on further:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks that he is Narco (German: drug dealers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me that, as if they were the ones who have lost someone and those who have fear that they also happened that way.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The inaction of man is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the merging of 43 students in a neighbor will be justified so that they were "infant."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to argue that they remain spared of such tragedies when they are not touching and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution of the four months of blackmailing in the main city. it describes how armed criminals has been plundered for month money from their business until it was not only destroyed by the business but also their families apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life totally in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain above never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes again high when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers as well.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">It included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or to kill.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez in Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: one of violence signed."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assassinated by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphans and he tells you to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas, tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies who live with it. this is his name for the preparation of the vial with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine Narbs on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and learning to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old one told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had been over two years earlier than he had just shot a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez saw the situation:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence is organised by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, JuÃ¡rez, the most endangered city in the world due to the number of murders for public security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010, the prosecutor secutor 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundred thousand stories, that leaves the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in view of new headlines. but this project is reminiscent of those that we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprentia Vivir Con El Narco," the Data journalism-Project Narcodata was launched, whose objective is to tortured complex information behind the failed fight against drug trading, which has folded the country in the last four decades, in intelligible manner.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how did the first appeared for the first time? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, it tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it was irreversible for use, tragedies that actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our longing for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a petrol embraces the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, kippte and exploded. so 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war in Africa the second largest country had been neglected and devastated, the streets in the region became too dangerous paths and became more striking that was difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Sales fell victim to the victim of the gas trolley.</seg>
<seg id="828">Authorities representative described a fireball, the incubation houses including a cinemas near, which was full of people who hiring the World Cup Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses perished and bonded corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the confession.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "This is Nigeria." from the Imgur-User mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.1.2 photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above there is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of a stolen body, which rose on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been investigated several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not related to real tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram the remotest villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses reported drastically by atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses were burned in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained back to count corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only with pictures of satellite images, the follow-time could be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The event for the attack remained unsolved, but the army of army in Basaga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram, to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo has emerged, when it was mistaken as proof of the fact and the possible level of attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this predictive use of the picture from the DR Congo has only been documented in a series of misorientation; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a testament to mass evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further bring personal comments such as this example, the image from the DR Congo, with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange came in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to an error message, published by the United Nations described those who could flee, rape and several deaths, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, talks like the following that these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi Arab news page, which was randomly claimed, the President Myanmars Thone being said, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture of the DR Congo to capture this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original fee, which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017, can be called here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organisations which AFP as their source scanned, had also doted a being of this statement, but did not allow the image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false coupling cuts down to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come back from anywhere around the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "converted picture-search," you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">A inverted picture-looking with the searchengine of TinEye has found 344 billion images (status of 3 May 2017) 344 paintings, which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mix of private pages, platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect here and now despite a language barrier with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written statement, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015 events, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass dying of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities, accepting the diversity - safe areas where residents do not forget who they are to include them.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "during" "" "it is often associated to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to feel, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers feature their story first in their own language and translate them then in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storyteller so their devotion and display make sure that the audiences can be induced thereto.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They give laughter and emotions when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows e.g. a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou will also take the opportunity to explain the typical customs of the narrative art for their land.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he declared the importance of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked, "How is it to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grinth, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were quite with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand it. all, who are inspired by the project, can contact TLS to organize their own storyteller.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a reconsideration of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which rose to 72 million US dollars, participated in the last 3 April 2017 various religious and bourgeois organisations on a mass demonstration; the march began at the Puertoriental Capitol, the office building of the capital, and went down to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here on licence-free, contains a number of sets that deal with free culture in face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for open knowledge are built and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have been working on page to look over the fog, who surround our newsletter and to make some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to liberate bassel Khartabil, the beloved and respected Internet volunteers, which has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information whatsoever about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own fates, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and digital activist has been in custody since March 2012 in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, transferred to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and attorney Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military police bases on the basis of a" strictly secret "drawn command from his cell in Adra had taken."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad administration and expressed it from an alleged death battle against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of stay and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, it played a crucial role to expand access to internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment, the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque cultural prototypes were previewed as the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the elimination of numerous civilizations and the Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after having started working with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture that embodied not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike into the digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time kapsel that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">I was not able to conclude that this project has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life for dreaming of freedom and Based taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Based brought me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other inders to write English, to write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought the internet to me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also contributed another detainted as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waste), a profiling which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Basle and Noura have worked together on the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">They mucked the lyrics to him when she visited him and he overlaid them out of the Syrian Arab.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is devoted to the public domain.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mosambian reacted by anger to a corruption accident, in which a government member returned after half his sentence in the workplace at the state apparatus, in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is about Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in 2010 together with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose advice Cambaza stood between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately asked for his re-setting into the company, which happened on 19 April then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General State Bar of the Republic, who subscribed the request, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza, again to refer to his old post as the company was not performing any disciplinaration according to his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many citizens do not matter well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated dade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company, the director returns:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents an envelope in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a setback with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should have a disciplinargues against the emitting wardly.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company appears apparently and prompted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, reject this behavior likewise and considers the case as" "" "vile" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to an prison sentence, and which the half has fallen.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He might have paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and his image to polish.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has entered into the company reintegrated, which he could cause harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is going to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, Young Mosambian and Student der Political Sciences in Brazil says, the director no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he defaulted him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already conquered the state as massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks moral to return and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead of serving himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as handmade by an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself is weary of this man who was loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook-users in Myanmar, the well-known social network recorded their posts from the net, because it enthused the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "Through the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "", "(in the mestial font) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate-language in Burma during the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements of the word has given an extremely disclosing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically retrieved to hate.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his usage.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burial words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair added to Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' written, which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (flage), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooky Aung Kaung Myate explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he enthused the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he asked his friends on a spiritual way, whether they knew how he could soothe his back pain by doing a word of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the" "" "ku la -" "" "healing" "" "(ku) + fragment (la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that they will reduce the hate-language radicalist Nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical and before it all the posts, that were in the suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The Automatism will not understand what you give to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (flage).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists spread the hate language, a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all, the hate language is spreading, the efficiency of this strategy doesn't hold long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords often will start a rubber and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myate described, such as Facebook anfing, to delete his posts, when he only gave to his friends only that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to accept the light, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post "Facebook community standards did not entail."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate-speaking nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail has been removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post he shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censorse such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "furthermore, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden words such as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "builders" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they were not trying to correct the falsical posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only some respect for the 15 million benefits, which had a great deal of turnover would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate-language, to see whether their posts are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of facets-posts that have no hate speech, but nevertheless there were:</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change in the German law, some members held a duist and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersist Maharaj, the leader of the interreligious organization (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered that the state would not interfere with the fact that the state does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's rights law, the minors being defined under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of the children who were married with 15 already in Trinidad and Tobago 2.4 per cent, and with 18 were 8,1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical Office of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online Petitions and Social-Media movements, which strives to set laws for child-before, followed at the foot and pleasing themselves great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-guides, for example had no concerns about the critics of the child-before, they should do, damn't care for their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This type of religious opposition catered for tension in this actually uncomplicated matter, and eventually got doubts as to whether the opposition would not agree to the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law was decided against the child before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of opposition and an independent who could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority could make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and preach the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle was reposted to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill draft against the child's before became in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for that and no single on it was decided on it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user were thrilled, because the laws were finally changed to the child-before.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-Member Lovell Francis, who was a prime office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has been all too much time and unnecessary talk which pered the heart of the thing, but do you know what? the child before is in Trinidad and Tobago now illegal, and this is almost worth every cost.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of the opinion was, there was definitely long enough to create the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which said:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law has been agreed.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for this - 0 against it!!!!</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which hears the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that was quite open about it, how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marquee of age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of religious confessions 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amended law has been adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and there were 35 members of the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members working against them have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The toe is legally not allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # childmarriage.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have read it.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our Members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">"" "" "" "ahead of months Maharaj has proclaims his intention to undertake judicial steps, should the law be adopted, and he seems to be inviting his promise now." ""</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the general state-General Paris Al-wi, a feeder of the law, argued that it would be quite legitimate if Maharaj would act against the law, the majority of social media users would like to tackle the issue differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear satellite, when we, instead of keeping the discussion so generally speaking, in a way that we, to guard the state into our bedrooms, "simply specifically talk about that the state, our daughters that may be misused to them, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's toe are legally legal or continuing the norm although there are laws they say.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Through the mirrors of websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was shown on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the US, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has now been holding the popular and crowdsourcing principle on the crowned principle in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day is clear how important the platform for users is to find helpful, as well as reliable information and sharing.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV series are opposed to the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologically beneficial Internet users are used to use conversions for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked in 2008 by Wikipedia, as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University has been held regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be blocked, now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-computer connections) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not available in spite of a legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via the blockage of Wikipedia) we put everything to remove snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also confirmed that this step was independent of the Wikimedia Foundation and is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansicloth.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, when in the particular country is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigiri - Global Voices, as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigiri's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One takes access to another URL that is not the original one. that which one then sees is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia page so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivate him to carry him a camera with himself and try to count the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune leads to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct the attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how he helps him the first-class position at his job:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested at home as I called suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard by the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was and I immediately began to articulate pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding of what wild animals are not as awful how they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it because he was already standing tigers from face to face toward:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the Buheks appeared. he turns right away; we look at it and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to make at Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days it lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect picture of birds that live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India it can avoid women with utmost care to utterance the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoomen or say "Father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women give women to respect them due to the social pressure the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should be misused to maintain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state of Odisha by a headcourt and chased by her family and the village community after they had addressed a married relatives.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition her wives also does not call upon the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less chance to fear, if at all, they should not come to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, a unique club and were thus fast to the main-American topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place just for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchal Patriarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and supports the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working with the help of their video camera with the help of their video camera on the covering of practices, such as children's heimen, and AIDS, and guides these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">They told them how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and have made them simultaneously a ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini in her discussion round showed, was of women who did not name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to utterance the name of their husbands, is a breeder that all of them have been kept guilty and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who doesn't hold this is considered to be deposited, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is deeply rooted, that we have never thought about this discussion at all times.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning she wanted Rohini, who had never called her husband to look at home, at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me around and said, I solle him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini launched its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women were trying to start the discussion with a practice.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, loving, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips," says Rohini Paths about the Break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women must never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she decided during the whole exercise just before locherished; another decided to allow the whole of frustration against him and his family by cursed it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush about it, having broken with an ancient customs, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put the women in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stared her, she got fear and said that there was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less intelligible and the situation deactivated in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports, how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing of galvanised point on the forehead, which shows the spinnate:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would bear the heart-red dot, if he had it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He took me only and I heard that to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not end up with it, but I think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we do a trip on every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want the women to worry about who that could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, they celebrated their own birthdays in their lives for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and spoke about things that they had never thought beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things, such as our identities with our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only Saris for their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most is the okay but some wanted a salad-cta, a wide shirt above a pants, wear; they have not entrusted themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of our own clothes, morals connected with the Saris and much more, brave Rohini their own pair of tas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round, so the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where you can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question, whether in the five months since its first discussion club has already changed something, Graini confirms that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it yet, but only when they are alone and not any other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands. only one or two women now carry out Zinnodred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the foothing for more freedom of movement or the own closeness - at the end of a difficult to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reported other people about what we talk and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video volunteer community are coming out of separate groups in India and make videos about stories about which is not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of detainted Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his Advocate was announced at the end of June that he was delivered to hospital for liver cancer in the end stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state of government), following the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto which the democratic reforms had filed in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as "an internal matter," and a spokesman told it as "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem fooled since Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shangrgam should be considered as a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Lawyers the State of New York, the Ministers agreed that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because in Singapore they compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is because most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "rotate the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and invitations to create this valuable land, you can say that we ultimately not be a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, eat country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of it, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reached the core point of the subject, the good old body appears from the authoritarian feasibility to be the Democrats, the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">During the last week of Shangrgam, the answers to his American guests were given regarding our press, our jubilatives, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">- asked appropriate questions with non-answers rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to make his mind clear, since it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow it.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city is, in which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">"" "" "" "I would be very grateful if our fabulous K Shangrgam would take the effort to clarify this point unless he was paid up in order to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1709">By clicking on the blog his comment, he points to the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co-ordinance of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>

<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he has obviously not meant to be in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shangrgam, who is acting as the leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said, very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - be with them or not, but this is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shangrgam, Member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is really believes and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review presents the weaknesses of Shangrgams argumentation:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr Shangrgam" "" "made a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudscher verb?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1788">Have a look at these recordings of the video to refer to some of the political issues that Thailand persecuted in the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants that cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillery and goldcolored earrings in TeddybÃ¤ren form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitian who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel rather has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with cold, very crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom, there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haititian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medication they can not pay, they massaged them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama was a reasonable nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurche) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes" "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston, to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells you that the Haitian and the Africans often travel together the track and that Africans speak on Whatsapp from Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his companions made Michelet lived in Brazil in advance, and has worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he has started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave it again," he smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells you their guests to send their own text messages if they went away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian Faith was the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought it to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family were added in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants will be sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep in blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cook outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he told. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">Having lived three years ago he was reported after a raid on his work place of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to his wife with his wife and three children who wanted to redeem money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for a accommodation and a unknown, an all-known, has offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the course of the course, the travelers calm their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she weed her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hairpin that you have made a customer, some photos of her grandkids and many travellers more, boy and Old.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July the mobile phone users received a cell phone in Tianshan District of the town of Urumqi, in which it indicates the District Government, a supervision app named Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "it is said that the app is said to have access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1967">Jingwanese website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the block of pornographic websites, of online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is meant to help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers may be able to manipulate the home network of a person or to steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often nosterer for those who live in remote, deported ethnic minority regions as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as regular monitoring procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1976">This published on Twitter based Media Outlet "Images from Mainland China" (Throde from Mainland China), the censored news in China showed photos of a checkpoint, at the police officers the residents selflaccidentally checked whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjies make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be detained for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is an envelope on technological development.</seg>

<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black saw the color of ruin, until I saw the yellow light that exhibited us the Greys in person: the Raad (e.g.: "Donner," Anspielung on 13 Sure des Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"you are here to hear sounds."</seg>
<seg id="2055">This was the secret to protect against us: to protect the state security from us and to prevent the oblique in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their confessional map and they played the narrow eye-field of its world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house, this is not a land; it is a curse to call it coexistence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I supervised the auditorium and trevel at Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he comes to me so.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He begins a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the facial expressions: "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to protest this diary and to protest on demonstrations which soon will find an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I replied not.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I used to accustomed to it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say when insults and strokes have become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to be punished, although I did nothing to earn these punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">An punishment in all their variety.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the lovingly "Gestapo."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloak.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoiced in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot keep your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My fear fell on him not enough why they replaceable the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">When my first trip I asked myself whether the investigators had worked as a garbage dump, or whether it belonged to normal working equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had got four cables intertwined to present us the ones from their view, great invention of a giant cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them rarely changed from them, while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner remarked the cooling and found no vessel at all, which is why he accessed as neighbourly for an electrified stone.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Stream flowed my entire body, enough to store my entire quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-bare body that lay on the ground was the perfect electricity companion.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness of vanity and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been so around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep myself again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light fills the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; sometimes he loops to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But to what you can rely, a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine gimmed lips to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel ended his occupation of the West Bank and met Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fellowyea (e.g.: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Since six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who poses the conservative majority and asks their old proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapids.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as Oriental alism, racism and the situation of the Palestinian Arab world. all these issues are not only enough in his hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities that are enough from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by borders, and it can have according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not give it openly, he turns against the US American foreign policy a special disinclination.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war areas, something with his identity as a "Palestinian refugees" to do, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think of my own life circumstances so" "" "stresses Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while in water soldered the stork nests in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Soviet law reveals that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the sounds of hot coffee and the waist of Kent cigarette lighter in the nose is first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, above all if one throws a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">From therefore, you simply avoids basic things to do - as in the public during the Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Jordan, had a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the islamic action of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual sides of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual sides of Hamed sensuo, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP & D spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "had been canceled" "" "because of the sexual orientation of the author." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm the commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that constitutes the well-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila said the jordant people as "progressive supporters of human rights" which continues to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to be simply a shallow rhetoric, but actually an increasingly clear crystallized reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to glue, he formed his vision of the fate of Arab women who have predominant sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a clearly disguised unfamiliar woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless wives who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In Jordan the number of "volunteers" has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to the human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached their climax in 2016; however, the institutional infrastructure is lacking to the women who have become the victims tried to support Morning or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on fragile control from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner violence, "at uncertain time in prison," and for its release is often a long-bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman is going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also do not shy away from issues that are in his country long as tabular.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib penises that his work is political, it admits that he is his music, the full explicit acceptance on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Mann.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I became a policy-gett, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are in the core of politics can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Haiaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other one is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words, "what you want" - be it faith or non-believe Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were greatly censored up in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib took an interview for the popular jordal OnlineProgramme Roya, later to remember that his comments had been torn out of the context, and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts but was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib buys open to the Arabic LGBTQ + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not talk to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in mind today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks herself: if Abu Nuwhat was to work later once on behalf of the potassisting, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality could write about homosexuality, why can the Jordanian parliament not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new more that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the jordal news, took several former government and members of the teacher association, with the reason that they would have expressed critical about the problems in social media, which coincides with the deep in the land rooting corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of that, the concert Hdaibs believe only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to induce a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks like hdaib - consists of slow, practical and internal changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the Venetian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreamy not only to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be fascinated by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams and on artificial art about guided democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is, Hdaib will continue and consequently also to resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belong to a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One thought it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory suggests that the festivities, the drums and the dance over more than one thousand years have been flooded in the northeastern region to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to impose on her knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could catch a few great seats, so we got a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have long been looking for the meuro Gajoen for a long time: two feasts are straight to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True - and yet to spend a breathtaking way of spending his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Sommerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and looked at the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meters high feast was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help keep away the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like the one of the hairdresses.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where street rob and illegal drugs are all daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel secure.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Brazil), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to that more and more normalaciers in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can make these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme boundaries of imagination and creativity, has even been inspired by an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" "" "Batalla de Barberos" "", "which has been held since 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts in order to show each other who can create the eccentred Looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to gain their weapons against hairdressing tools and receive training in the hairdressing tools that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the offers of dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the beginning of March and reported on some of their successes:</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: love to guerrilla warfare</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the post message "love message on guerrilla warfare," which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write love to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel united to offer affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question proceeded the two young Colombian activists from the Stiftung Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Youth Foundation, no more from the head and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters for reconciliation) to write young people to write guerrilla warfare.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla war against the guerrilla war against the guerrilla war against the guerrilla war in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the understatement of the peace contract as so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombian people, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warfare that had been exposed to illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric, and carried out their weapons with themselves, have now to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred of guerrilla warfare, has to record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Columbians have to come together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love-message to former guerrilla warfare to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the Campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters of reconciliation emerged on the world Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the man who we love, on Valentine's Day's thousands of love to write, but those forget that they need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plan, he told us to share his love with people this year, the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write with letters full of hope and support for former fighters of FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected in the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranco and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono region in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogota are in the camp to transmit the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were so on how they had done it before in order to prevent the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of underprotection of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the policy-knowing Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a representative of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had given the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla-fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuds" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla warfare) saw, I saw a guerrilla warfare that wrote a little.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because in addition to it on the bed was a mGL-granatlauncher, a deadly weapon in the village.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said it anyway, and said," "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I reply to a letter that someone has written for me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeless letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone was written something so nice, so I reply to it. I suddenly ran the tears across the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him firmly and set me next to the pomeglights.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry, was sorry, to be all the years of the faithful companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers in front of hunger. "I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my fault.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there, which awaits us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I learned just how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Fortunately, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had grown up all grew up as a war and the FARC already worked in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years have experienced how the social injustice through the whole Colombian people came out. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of this scale, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard before and no electoral law, and to realize that people who have often seen as a monster and even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings were turned around, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land lives, does me hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage caused to teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian species was marked that after the disarmament would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as it is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to protest to the weapons and protest for their rights. and this is also totally justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now put on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong to it - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">While I was just doing a few shopping bag from the back of my car, I heard a male vote: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned my mind, I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt.</seg>

<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had gotten everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keywords in my right alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which casements were you placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name dron; but the doctor got up and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">So I am very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his brush, I got it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a casian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The required to return to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd some demands: some said to me, I must prove it by being at the top without going through the streets; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in Grosny, and say that I had not changed my sex that all was only bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have graaf-size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only ashamed your family, but the whole of the Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can not stir you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she placed himself a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours were coming and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with knocked shutters and a numbering plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Having happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right friends audits the numeric signs - it turned out that I was prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have flown?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registration without any ID, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came on and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put up the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to invoke my mother by Whatsapp, I got a message: "you do not think about, you are in security, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you stayst. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it is the number 115" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we are not talking about the gender equality, that is a spooktopic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional casian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I also wish, these pastoral barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give me the effort to look like the person they remember from their past - so in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who have stayed dorff?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who has fed the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely, they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in these secret certificates?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then mainly those who have no rich relatives, or who were left by their relatives to place Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "say: should they be turned to show her body on television and claim, they would have attacked your village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged to radiate themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only one failure or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There have been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have they simply taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was self-evident than these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as a bandits, but there were no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would you not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if this persecutions and kidnappings of people who heard a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think earlier in 2003 I was already well-known as I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was held, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia was originally forced to lead us to the "civilians", but eventually sent us back to the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were pressed; I had colored lashes, carried the tube, and short baptiops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia has never curved to me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulting.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is said, "Spotte does not talk about the unhappiness of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It often says it to children when they make up about sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulting, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this graces change?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to speak on television via morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but primarily on the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who smiles and had suffered, consider yourself with suspicion, at one time with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I got back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly wasted.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still working as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">At present I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, compositions, I begining them to the hospital and help them to get fisher again.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a penny for them.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I kled shelter.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you carry a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So the nature that has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechnya that would prophesied to you with foam before the mouth, that there are no swings with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have who, the Kabardiner, who have the Russians," "" "on the whole planet there is - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, that is why it is unpleasant for me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many thinking about transiidentity to men, men love, and they believe that man changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a truthful.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling in order to be exact, different ways of living.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will personally become so personally but my last intimate relationship is already last longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2410">Arab Awazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab Awazi community is located, was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to punish their livelihood.</seg>

<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to grow slow, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and hardships.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi-Arabs systematically jobs in local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, which lie water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region through drying, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm trees industry.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Being functional and institutions preferred non-Arab labour, the local Arab Awazi shall have access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their livelihoods outside of their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pre- and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, and to become so put, since even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, because speaking the Arabic language or the wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>

<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not a feminist, react many women - especially white women who call themselves as an interdirectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well-thought scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all the feminist * within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation if it is about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass blanket, and that discrimination based on sex are still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I stayed double and triple among them.</seg>

<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of me full of feminism and join me to the movement of Womanism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of putting me for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so insistent that interaction is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">It is more important than ever before that we define black women with our own ideas and set us into the spheres, created by us for us.</seg>

<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersetional feminists immediately will call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, which the black woman is concerned.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really misdirected, Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for genius questions at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports, which however do not even ansatedise the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains her.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 at the District State Bar 9600 ads went for domestic violence. at 70% of this it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There have been more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace geries. also here 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads said 40% of women, that they were physically compelled, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Women of Minister of Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually shown. "on any woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, come 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who will be refunded because of physical abuse, are two women who do not do this, "explained them end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's genocide in Paraguay has no own crimes, the prosecution authorities cannot document properly, how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Only until August 2016 journalists have at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies because of violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the solid friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name to him all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning they didn't want it, but then after. this should be regretted for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer coincided with Carlos. but two years she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognisable the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that that only women had happened to be subserviently because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen that.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetorical, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and not left him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say the victims of abuse at least to have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos that did not originate from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is suspect her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te CREO ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in any way sacrifice of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner finally got it to persuade them that it was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias displays at the authorities were without a result and also by their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It carried out a process against their former partners who developed into an unclear legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay's laws: good approach, deficient implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but are not applied.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen lizard, a representative of the UN-Organisation for Women in Paraguay, looks also great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill design was discussed under the hashtag # Porellas (# ession).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the Movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Unless) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law reveals to explain Femizid to an independent criminal statement and to be harder to punish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in some points, in order to also win the MEPs in favour of the law that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions will be denied which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill design had envisaged, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which have to carry the victims of violence themselves, if they just want to report and receive a secure accommodation to surrender to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echo argued that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, distraction is seen as a part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink has to take place, so that violence is no longer considered as a little Normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever deals with this facts makes it guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We need to report as long ad until distraction does not apply more than normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguan Senat. previously, parts of the law had been changed, but among other things, a passage was painted, which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor, to once again intervene.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than one year ago, the omanic authorities have closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of their reporting on corruption in the Sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Youzal-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues in prison, where he is in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and made to court, but later returned.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after having set his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a state of state.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, he dressed, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the main ministries in the country: Prime Minister, Defence Minister, ruler of the Defence Forces, Minister of Foreign Affairs, President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of sultans is characterized by the perseverity efforts of security forces, in particular of domestic law, including freedom of government, including freedom of freedom, including press freedom, bloggers, and other activists to deduce, intimidate and detained.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically opposed and hinders citizens, activists, to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure, and the detention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy), until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>

<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial was held at Silhouette the first hearing in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court condemned the three journalists to prisons, and numbered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned among other things because of disruption of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "subordination of the press of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was beyond the violation of a publication and slander for guilty.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years of arrest and money laundering in the amount of 3000 omanic Rial (7800 US dollars). in addition, a one-year veteran agreement was imposed on the two journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year prison and an average of 1000 rial (2600 US dollars) after the use of "an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri a deposit was established in the amount of 5000 omanic Rial (13 000 US dollars) and he was already released on 22 August 2016 before the Court of Judgement.</seg>

<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after the repayment of his six-month prison sentence in the centralous prison. al-Haj is still in prison, where he is in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeal Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court, Azamn, the newspaper sees itself as before attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information granted a statement by which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information Minister gave up a further statement in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and thus the minister announced another time against the decision of the Appeal Court to resume the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the press freedom has been violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injury count for example the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the adhering of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the omanic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls for the omanic authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. YouÃ³zal-Haj immediately and unconditionally free;</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit warriors 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need on-run medical research there are two reasons: there are many medicines and vaccines that are lacking in the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries are far more serious than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the exploration of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, establishing own research capacity in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit warriors is director of the Central Market at the Center for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic's first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself explored the HIV virus, before he decided to go home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. warriors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstanding of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. warrior speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriors RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sampled national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also starving a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion about the important current sciences topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the finance and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">Rw: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well funded.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research work, which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">Rw: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">Rw: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, where should they focus and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe us the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">Rw: often it is the limited speed, things to do, and the easy access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals can only make payment accessible (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of availability information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed produces world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This entry by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solving possibilities for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton were bred in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its enterprise offers 114 varieties such as Outredgeous, the first plant cultivated by NASA Astronauts in Space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years Mortons's work was released only by its own downturn and the question of how many salutors he can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he remarked that more salads have been patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual sorts, but also for certain properties like wattage against diseases, a special red or green tone or offended leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants such as grain and carton sites. due to these trends, plant breeders are worried, environmentalists and experts about food safety for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition bred Morton still salad, he now needs to last longer because his work is increasingly complicated by more constraints.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is, as would lie down a rock in a river to triumph." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we must do that now, but it is a rupture with the breeding-tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go far from salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they withstand judgment, no one can grow a new salatype, because all the features are already patented, so as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics which he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tried to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the U.S. and around the world: open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International indoor station ISS have bred red RÃ¶mersalat the Sorte Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there will be tested, whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It's no coincidence that this name sounds rather than would the movement originate from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to make sure that some plant species and genic are not being protected as intellectual property and are permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, the US breeders can commit themselves to use that others are able to use seed freely freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed, and they can sell it. "open source" breeders merely allow others to breed their seed, to breeding it, and it will not immediately rinse - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant producers.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeried professor University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board member Jack Kloppenburg is control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement is not busy with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "who supplies good, locally and sustainable productabled vegetables, should also know that the way it is bred for example, should also know how this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "nutritional" "" "nutritionalism without seed are not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing others their seed will continue to be available freely. this is how its action is in contrast to the plant, seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available genital pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on the plant material which is thus always reduced, incessly shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the Ossi, has worked in their doctoral thesis with genetical variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all the cartography are protected as intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either at all or only.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants like wheat in still bigger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their taste or colour improves down to such, due to which they thrive into certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders through more and more patents decreases. genetic diversity is now worse than ever since the changing conditions are much worse by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speaker in Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsantos activities. with a total of four genital banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property has other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant-effects innovations will promote." "" "a patent is basically a plan that every one can follow once the patent is expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions are helping others with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is not inhibits innovation, but it promotes the public more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees what is different: 20 years waiting until a patent is drawn, there is certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you need to wait for such a long time to breeding plants that have been adapted to the changed environment conditions, the fight would have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their job easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be made impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether, Morton is bothering to apply to the concept itself, plant characteristics: "we create the characteristics not really itself.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants do they themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant-house in the US-State Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding: "who bred a kind, bred even his own values in it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are required for the cultivation of massages, bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly" "" "dirty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as are moving on international markets, but smaller than such as Monsanto are patents exist, there are most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either lean or keeping it for expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding-garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeder by the prevention of plant producers of innovative would: "it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies, the patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constant new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years, "says he." with a patent you have been around 20 years before competition, how to make it quite nice easily. "global response</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still they still lock the Egyptian authorities contents on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government had documented the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reported above all above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook, in which it criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abides; despite this attack and the mock of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, which the law should defend to its goal, to cover freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never so important as it is now. ANHRI has never been so important to overcome these objectives and do not give it. we insist that our task continues to fulfil.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months 21 web sites, such as bsplit or independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking issue of Huffington Post and the originating network of Al Jazeera because of the alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of wave of wedge barriers to victims. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI also exists on the blog of the Columbus and Human Rights, Ahmed Gamal Ziada, no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of Kolumba and articles that he does not write access websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to deal with the censors of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of the blog's blog is native, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces during December 2013, while he reported on the Studenten's protests and recorded a video like the police of physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, however, has been priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs might not be significant for the world, so it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege of siege; an arrest, a attempted murder, discharge at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I have not written in vain. in other words: my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles to deal with the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mug go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities of 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this gained technical tests in the networks of various Internet service providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisan.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, through the use of boarding facilities and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12 we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer, began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content that could have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation will be drained in addition, that the censors will be made behind closed doors, thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis to proceed to the court against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>

<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "this published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "on 16th August 2010," "" "This is not normal" "", "where they announced a new category called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that occur in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sex disruption, etc. everything, but what happens in Rio, is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video a journalist of the newspaper declares that there are indications of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then ask questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose objective is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than it used?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argued the journalist of CecÃ­lia Oliveira on the other hand, to call the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of failed security policy through the media and could aggravate them accountable to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military power in Rio itself has shown - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and independent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. for several years, the UPP was actually meant to protect several reports of rails and repressions against the poor communities, which should protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles from the year 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer under brutal attacks and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization Pax and the Forschungsinstitut The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umberland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region is particularly affected by the East Ghouta region where an attack with chemical weapons took on the 21st of August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organizations that have been practised by the massacre of Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, they have been stranded by the rebels outside of Damascus, which led to the fact that inhabitants depend on local people or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the years of blockage, traditional food such as meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alas and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to conventional, in Syria natural foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the belated East ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The directive of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reported Global Voices, that has been fighting this project for three years, and expressed its relief that it gains more and more "an acquaintance."</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, take advantage in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alas the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article they reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12.700 â¬, but will continue until Monday, the 04. September 2017, continue to collect donations to CanDo.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is instructed on generators, which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the fuel scarcity locally produced fuel from plastic used to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with the "production from the regions of pilgrims" before they audits their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small pilgrim in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in the East ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2838">According to the European forest control system, which monitors the forest area with satellite recordings, alone in Portugal in Portugal approximately 500,000 hectares of forest burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years previously, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedine groupings which had conquered the shortcut pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hitara domed Party Hezb-e-Wahsoldier was just murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt protectionable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban sitting for their hatred at the Hazara-known Taliban were ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his escape, Asharks found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a couple of years in a carbon pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left out of his little wages, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and towed bags with mortar, the heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today, the life of Afghan refugees was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," remembered Ashark in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in a leerstanding building on the construction site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating available there. we hanging nylon in front of the open windows so that we may not refractive at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing to the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "" "" "after the Greek authorities had refused its asylum application, Ashark came to Italy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was anodeaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy people.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is due to relatively high availability quotas a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers can be found in the country, catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Rights Organisation for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centres." "" "this is improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared staff." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a entrance center, if they officially asked an application for asylum - which can still lead to asylum after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his uncurb CV helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years in construction in the construction industry, Ashark threw its entire savings in the creation of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that he opened after a while still opened a second hostel and a schnellimbiss.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis success story is now the theme of the "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians, are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies were created by Afghans, including tailoring, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>

<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari, opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharks's goals are far beyond the Italian Gastronomy and the retail trade and aim back to the country, which he had to leave behind as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, are also possibilities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can't live happily if I know that my people suffers.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest countries of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as anyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Ashark is also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people will be able to learn packaging and confessions. "thus they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through insecurity and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark has made this journey itself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
