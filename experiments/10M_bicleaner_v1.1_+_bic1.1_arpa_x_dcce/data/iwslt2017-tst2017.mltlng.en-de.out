this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times Re@@ porter .
long before each one of Edward Snow@@ den had heard , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular published that the NSA heard illeg@@ ally heard of Americans .
it is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service , in which the CIA has literally dra@@ fts across Iran for a nuclear bom@@ b .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter fell at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 10 years the government has identified against r@@ isen and encouraged him to call on its inn@@ y sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and journalists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if the identity of the mu@@ g cannot protect them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so when the government landed in isen , he did something , what many coura@@ geous re@@ por@@ ters did before him : he refused to go and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary .
suddenly , although she had no means for years , that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to leave .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porter and sources can always hide less .
rather than bringing down and cr@@ acks to the statements , that could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators have concerned , without his consent , his phone calls are secre@@ tly concerned ;
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit , and even travel tests with the list of his flights .
among this information they found evidence to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and Ris@@ ens on alleged source .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judiciary has more sentenced to him than all the U.S. governments .
now you can imagine how one can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the PR for the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to pick up all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , just as technology of the government allowed to deal with the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can get it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in testimonies .
today there are communication software that had not yet been written as R@@ isen , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the internet illustri@@ ous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today approved by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information to your usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ag@@ es@@ technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology @-@ in@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way of bringing offen@@ ders . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ,
the reason for ab@@ uses in the care of soldiers is humble and will be reported by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers who suggests the alarm for the poll@@ uted water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only committed to those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; was revealed in the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ itness on a statement . &#93; this week we were greeted by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has come back .
also there are reports that a fo@@ e of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad envelope in tax hav@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin conduc@@ ts over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release , and on the next revealing documents .
now it sounds like the pel@@ lot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham .
it seems crying out by you , me , ordinary people .
why should we let us know what ?
but the truth is : if the rich and mighty being able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global W@@ itness , these revelations are phenomenal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret , tax hav@@ ens will be used by some of them to hide and conce@@ al their assets - something that we have been discussing and revealing ourselves for ten years .
I think many people will appear this whole world very confusing , and it is difficult to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always place it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ um@@ ably , because there has been no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle , after these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ lem Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a vision of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have links to the US .
in fact , it is so that in some US states you need to provide less information to establish a company than to get a libr@@ arian .
this type of in@@ contin@@ ence in the US has allowed employees of school@@ ing to leave school children .
it has frau@@ ds allowed to rip specially an@@ uts off .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global W@@ itness we wanted to find out how all this would like in practice .
how does that work actually ?
so we sent a c@@ apped investig@@ ators into the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself an African Minister , who wanted to bring demon@@ ic money into the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it really , that everyone could make suggestions up to a lawyer by our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ alleg@@ ations . none of these lawyers participated in ourselves as clients , and of course no money was passed on to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual inci@@ dents .
it is not about a single attorney who has made suggestions down to our c@@ apped investig@@ ator .
it is not about a single leader , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability is established .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we must change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound all very v@@ ows , as if we could do anything about it ; as if nothing had changed , as if there will always be the rich and mighty .
but as bor@@ rowed optim@@ ist I really see that a lot has begun to change .
in the last few years , we have seen accus@@ ation towards greater transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global W@@ itness , this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the spot@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy , get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ contin@@ ence through laws .
together we can end In@@ transparent , which now allows those kinds of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally finish .
this is the story , as I once again kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ ker@@ et .
one day after I had completed my design study , I made a back@@ yard on sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked like my things .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and made just a road trip through whole country . after that , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him . he said that he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of one Maz@@ ow@@ es !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h , how to please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I got there ?
a game @-@ ran@@ ged in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of the bed , on to@@ g@@ uts to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he bought from me is now in his class@@ rooms . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as stran@@ gers actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattresses , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses .
we make a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mates draws off and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can make it easier to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over@@ looked , how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and founded such &quot; air mattresses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on wood floors with us for 20 dollars .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we traveled with them through the whole city . as we said our last guest , and the door fell into the castle , vigor@@ ate Brian and I ourselves .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
the things came to roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
this is how we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a site where people publicly post their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the type of room , whose doors can be concluded when you come by .
over the internet they can then invite people to invite people to stay with them .
it will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but , they do not .
nobody who still is at Tro@@ st would invest in a shop , the stran@@ ger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we have learned as children all that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you have to be aware of the things that one can do . we could des@@ ig@@ s .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is overall experience .
we had learned how to des@@ ig@@ ed objects , but now we wanted to create trust by the design of immense trust between people who have never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I &apos;d like to give you a sample , what degree of confidence we put up .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ b up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hands .
now I like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your de@@ cryp@@ ted cell phone to your left seat .
this quiet an@@ flug of panic , which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the sli@@ pped mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so , most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just once so , who has now actually Al Gor@@ it &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you preach on Twitter for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ; if he would have told how he does , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 evaluations , which all say : &quot; he can really very well ent@@ win@@ ed mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel when you &apos;d like to give your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative effects .
ultimately , we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had given their assess@@ ments before we created them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and housing .
little surprising we trust the people most , who are most like most of us .
the more differences we find , the less we rely .
this is a natural social assimil@@ ation .
exciting it becomes exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by not@@ ations .
if you have less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , it changes everything .
a good reputation sti@@ ck@@ out similarities .
the right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can get from yourself .
here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little as for example &quot; Hi ! &quot; you do not get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they tell a lot , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request will not be accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le art@@ works in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family holiday . &quot;
how can we create it with design to produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text@@ box to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we had not reck@@ oned was the great deal of people who were more than willing to locate these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties or apartments devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front , when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment you hear in the voice of An@@ ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves .
fortunately , the night had only a fraction of the problem of the 123 million , ever a fraction of the problem .
because people trusted each other rightly .
if trust works , can be mir@@ ac@@ ulously developed .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers who tend to tend to work due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real Guardian Angel that save life , even though they do not know it properly .
you travel to hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure money campaign are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with counterf@@ eit actions fit together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an economic trade here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ten@@ ancy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes an trade , which promises human relationships .
people put a portion of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , this is to be compared with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but this is less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group there would wait for a group of Ans@@ wer to fill a thoroughly and to show a bar of a pub that one has never heard before .
or if you could learn from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from the ground to another ?
how would this look ?
what if cities do the thoughts of the common share ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government .
were now offered by residents . students who were looking for a b@@ lei@@ be ,
were taught to people whose children were pulled out . there were incub@@ ators programs ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone will be hosted by night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries as a guest at a stran@@ ger or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality there was also before .
there have been similar websites .
so why has just our works ?
apart from happiness and tim@@ ing that we can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome profound prejudi@@ ces .
I find that intrigu@@ ing ,
almost to be overwhelming .
I don &apos;t have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da has gone over to me .
we of course know that design can not solve any problem .
but if it was able to help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
is a belie@@ ver ? an Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or suppres@@ sed , subjected to brain@@ washing , a terrorist attack ?
or just a delay in security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I give you not the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study sur@@ rendered that 80 % of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show the Americans , most would not know any Muslims .
most people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met one Muslim : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I say to you , who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ s @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual muscle .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I have decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ting me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lus@@ atia was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , namely towards the pressure , which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt me to a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , figured in question , doub@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to the we@@ eping .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , led to the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; message &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
da was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ill from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should you do something like this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I joined the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; on behalf of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it was not only my country to be attacked but in the N@@ u transformed me the actions of others from a bourgeois in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building .
I remember the way I drove -- and so deep it went into my sitting room , and I felt the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Muslim organisations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful in well illuminated areas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
and again the warnings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of it .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also listened to Muslims or by people who held free for Muslims , and suggested for Muslims .
there were really burnt attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not true .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have turned the anger of the people into the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain themselves constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go her ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tum@@ our in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all the other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but an vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hei@@ fer and Olympi@@ ad .
will make sure the closure of mos@@ ques is safer ?
maybe there will be a few parking spaces free , but not the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to regard people other faith tolerance and to show greater citizenship .
and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC recently reported : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . as the first the person is cut off from her church , even from their family , so that the extremi@@ sts who believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ise their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
when we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Quran .
as Mus@@ lim@@ ine , as a mother , as a person , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves into its imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at it , they don &apos;t drive them what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because they were fed to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with which she had spoken , she brought to silence and said to her , that their anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring in trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that had given their anger sense , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by the extremi@@ sts that gave their own solution .
this Ima@@ m made the connection with God and her church again .
instead of applying them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight , such as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day look at our democracy , to our freedom of freedom ?
a study -- actually several neurological studies -- show : when we fear , happen at least three things .
we do not accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces .
one study shows : when you pres@@ et Test@@ ed News in which negative about Muslims was reported , they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an acute problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims came up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two choices of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning @-@ character .
we might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear rel@@ a@@ det to all of us .
in the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ism , it is not only about how to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous human being he knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is from my bro@@ therhood of such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne on her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after having posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page .
he poured out eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we left at the mosque , or remained we safe at home ?
we loved it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was a matter of what America we want to do to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the nursery we drove to the mosque , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , moved my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , expressed himself and welcomed our guests , because the half of the gathered together were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , cov@@ ings and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to join us .
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to see the number one ?
or will you join those who say , we are better than those .
thank you .
thanks nice !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a think@@ ers with deep access , are working in a pos@@ h monument factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , dec@@ eive you . I am totally normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I have no exception in any respect .
if people seem to appear as an exception , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is in short run to become a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug performance . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ net income in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flight machinery in the F@@ RAC Centre in France live in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting air @-@ systems reach high speed and speed up on a narrow space .
you can also build a self @-@ constantly pull @-@ up structures .
you have learned to wear loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus a system aut@@ on@@ ome works , it needs to know collective , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a list of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space , determine calculations on board , which should do the machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be found at the highest level . e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called h@@ eck@@ starter ,
an airplane , trying to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
as other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ches it can float , and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind ar@@ ches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and improved performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often provide basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter .
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts , which accum@@ ulate to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pil@@ ots have been able to fly @-@ controlled air@@ instruments , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tro@@ pe one .
un@@ long discovered we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ d@@ inner , the mechanical simplest radio remote aer@@ ator . it was invented recently .
it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hinges and cross @-@ ships , no further actu@@ ator or control areas , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , happens in inner life very much so that it can fly stable and can move into space .
nevertheless it does not have an elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it right now , if all of me look , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the mon@@ tains is a practice in indul@@ gence , this machine is here , the om@@ ni @-@ head with its eight Prop@@ ellers , a exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is not only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus he receives the extraordinary capacity ,
moving in space to all directions , no matter which direction it is turned or even as he ro@@ cked .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Prop@@ ellers .
some is conceivable in models , the rest is learned directly with flying .
let us see that .
if air @-@ presses are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller wings .
this turns on clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when one builds them , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller drops out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted .
we will now demonstrate that we make half an air@@ worthy one .
the last demonstration examined synthetic cont@@ enders .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows an array of aesthetic expression .
we took wholesale Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with localization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine as there is a fine lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creations , to form it in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1,3 billion years ago , in a very distant galaxy , two black holes are getting stronger each other than faster , you walked so the mass tri@@ bul@@ s in a tenth of the energy around .
this short moment saw it brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they do not put your energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we arrange the events initially for a time .
1,3 billion years ago , it was just a multi @-@ dimensional life on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sauce , people and -- God is standing by us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group especially coura@@ geous -- R@@ ai Weiss from M@@ IT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- trying to find a huge laser det@@ ector , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are about by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation has financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of LIG@@ O could considerably increase resulting in recognition performance .
therefore , it is called Advanced LIG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O was started for a last run to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after commissioning of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes through the earth .
you went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell of my to@@ d@@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
all this I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cists on M@@ IT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ton@@ ing in the fabric of space and time .
at the temporary of the wave , the space and its entire content into one direction are stretched and into the other .
in view of illustr@@ ating lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses of rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a really Algeri@@ an dance .
&quot; stretch and reser@@ ving , stretch and reser@@ vo@@ irs . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us stretched out the waves of the waves and gest@@ ures . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by one 1. of this one declared the LIG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ el of a nuclear radius radius . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LIG@@ Os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are force@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are Finnish and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott is happy , LIG@@ O is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial elev@@ ators , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite handy . for so you can make a picture or a map of things by pointing out the light from several points around you .
with tones , this is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you particularly much :
around the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen to certain properties like tape and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob dis@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ ck Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in the universe with them .
but by doing changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least are the measured frequencies in audi@@ ble field .
so when we transform wav@@ el@@ patterns in sound , we can listen to all the literally .
the gravity too loud , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has very busy with Scott .
SH : two black , not rotating holes , cir@@ c@@ ers simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , one hear the same pair of circulation with an additional sound change . that sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of motion liter@@ al , pronounced in the wav@@ el@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- LIG@@ O Fol@@ der : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ ches of the sound &#93; Som@@ and , who knows what he must hear , this is as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun @-@ mass , which will turn around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ er .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 Son@@ nen , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O eb@@ net has a completely new way to explore the Al@@ ls as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible .
much in space we can -- practical or fundamentally -- not visible .
a super nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why masculine stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them .
the exciting physical processes occur but at the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ licon .
we will never pass through since these op@@ ies are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would explore more transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang I would like to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it , since the Ur@@ b@@ ang is covered by its own p@@ endant .
with the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover when we listen .
in fact , LIG@@ O found right in the first attempt things that we did not expect .
my colleague on M@@ IT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this subject : me : the kind of stars , the black holes are observed , as LIG@@ O they observed are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are the su@@ ction no@@ des for our archaeological work .
LIG@@ O makes us a completely different point of view on the events in space , at the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we went forth out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as coura@@ geous as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories in Earth and All .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say to all &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I was afraid of that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes &quot; yes . &quot;
I wanted to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly that is what I was afraid , rec@@ essed my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep my social anxiety -- Pu@@ ff , weg .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain Yes that deeply changed my life on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ al@@ son . and Emer@@ al@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all the ... &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play always with them once you ask me to ask . no matter what I do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I comp@@ elled me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an intrigu@@ ing side @-@ effect : only recently , I was fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ ws to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author , I think things you want to live .
dream@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I Cre@@ ate TV . I &apos;m producing TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days once four shows , thus all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours on TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows are going on Thursday Saturday night .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts , which I have created , and not only produces , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollar , camp@@ fire that burn around the world .
do you know who that is still doing ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say it to you so all of you who work so hard if you speak now a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , if I speak of work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just ro@@ cking on the computer and f@@ anta@@ si@@ ere , and it is true when I say , I understand that it does not work for a dream@@ job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all the blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I am deeper into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
it is , when I set troops , when I was on a canvas .
as well , you see a high tone , fly a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous , and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and pru@@ dent , cru@@ el and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the money .
there is such a change within me when the work is running well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the money la@@ ends like a bustling street , I could always drive on her .
many people participate when I tell them the money , that I am writing to writing that writing my joy .
understand me not wrong , this does it .
but the tot@@ als -- when I began to work and work with television production as I began to work and to work , build , create , and work together , I discovered this thing , this money , this energy . the tot@@ als !
the tot@@ als is more than writing .
the money is action and activity . the money is a drug .
the money is music . the money is light and air .
the money is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a tot@@ als , you cannot do otherwise than after size .
the feeling that can not be different from the same size , no matter what price .
this is what we call the money .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic to be .
maybe it is genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
I just know that I did not fail to fail and I just know that I love the money .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it into question .
to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more the more episodes , the more work there , the more things simultaneously , the more you see me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more you have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love working , not true ?
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the money , the money , the money , the money .
I like this money . I love the money .
I need the money . I am the money .
am I just this money ?
and then it stops the money .
revised , exagger@@ ated , over@@ laid , burned .
the money stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mother is a single work@@ book .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ al@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a title .
you are baby @-@ ti@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when I heard the money .
the sums of the engine du@@ st@@ ated .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was out .
the money did not come back .
my money was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , un@@ worked weekends , no repentance , do not deleg@@ ate a titanium asleep , does not give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV channels , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the money and the money I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly verbal ?
I know , some may think : &quot; hypo@@ l yourself from , stupid the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you do it , you don &apos;t work , you love to be a teacher , a banker , a mother , Bill Gates to be , you just love one another and that gives you the tot@@ als if you know the money , if the money stops , who is you ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart ceas@@ es , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late next , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , don &apos;t you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will say no , when two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kittens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is it happening ?
I miss it when I am at Titan and my bu@@ zz , and here all changes from my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , don &apos;t you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters , we laugh a lot and I feel quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ eliness and lack of the thir@@ st , I can do nothing except that fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land , which I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id k@@ isses , delicate voices , qu@@ int@@ al pins and the song in which it is going to let loose , or whatever the girl gets in &quot; The Iron Cur@@ ches . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breath@@ ed .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me is dissolved .
a mental door goes up and an energy club comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the money is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it is silent , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the money , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the money , the working environment , the Titan@@ ic , this is just the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , when I tell you , who I am , when I complain of broad@@ casts and TV hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real money is .
the money is not force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the pleasure .
the real money is dependent upon the love .
the money is the current one is coming from the life of life .
the real money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real tot@@ als ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the di@@ eting tasks , the expectation and pressure .
the real money is simple and original .
the real money is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe God inspir@@ es me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this for a fixed rule , so that I can rid myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any fault .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the money again .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t play as much as I work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am rather at the workplace as a home . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this input is painful , because what kind of man works rather than to be home ?
well , yes , I .
time honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we sm@@ ashed soap bub@@ bles .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused .
I always att@@ acking my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the money of the universe meets me .
I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ?
you can also say it ! yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams .
you have probably right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not Ri@@ h@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show @-@ figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they wanted them to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ äfer or K@@ ek replaced me .
and speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more it does not need .
everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes by the play !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready .
but 15 minutes are penet@@ rated !
my children are my well @-@ feel , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to have the money to have a place for his soul .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
about the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it up .
I am not perfect in it . I sho@@ cked and I si@@ ege . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in my education , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 Min@@ utes a piece , why not get in full 15 minutes ?
what can it be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the money seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door open up the energy flows and I find myself back in my office . I listen to a unknown melody , she ful@@ fills me and my soul . she temp@@ ts me to new ideas . I put it again its way again . I take advantage of it in full and love my work again .
I like the money , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I am not the money , the money is not me ... not anymore .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is my sums .
the money of life .
the money of love .
the money of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so thankful .
it &apos;s cool to me that I am a Titan Poker . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is even functional . my camp@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the money , the marathon that I run , the marathon , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the money , the money , the money , the money , the money , the money , the money , the money , the money .
the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things I awake you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live its dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream@@ job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or accident .
for us neuro@@ surgery , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system the patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was working with a functional neuro@@ surgical procedure .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve functions by means of various surgical measures .
certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; thereby , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuit circles of neur@@ ons so that neurological manifestations are improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , which suffered under fierce tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with something help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading Ober@@ physician and worked in the emergency day and night in the emergency .
often I ordered patients with sk@@ ull @-@ deer .
they must imagine that in sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain is in@@ will@@ ted and the sk@@ ull pressure increases .
to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure .
for this one has to sometimes remove a portion of s@@ wollen brain .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells of a gun race grow , is comparable to quite small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish them .
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts are Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you know yet from Bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ Less@@ ons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells are , who can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nut of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface texture of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ or@@ tal .
but these cells were surv@@ eyed .
they went slowly and after a few weeks they had even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our big hir@@ k@@ rin@@ se cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fo@@ etus , they provide for the f@@ ission of the brain .
but why do they stick to us ?
we do not know that .
we believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain because we find it in higher concentr@@ ations near brain injuries .
this is not that safe .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , which enables bra@@ king healing .
this we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingual area , and then the cells to cultivate exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they were then marking , in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we r@@ acked it on the recording position of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- auto @-@ spl@@ ant .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we r@@ hy@@ ming these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we r@@ hy@@ ming the same cells in bra@@ d brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with ape .
in the first scenario , we pl@@ ast@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that they had been removed completely after a few weeks , as if they were returned home , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not go there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a injury to and r@@ hy@@ ming exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were r@@ hy@@ r@@ hy@@ per .
the proof that they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
help these cells also recover a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
so we fabri@@ cated apes with a manual and sk@@ inn@@ ate task .
they had to take feed p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
as they reached a stable skill level , we se@@ eded the hand mot@@ echn@@ ology in the mot@@ orized Cor@@ tex .
subsequently , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen with people , they recover spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to rec@@ u@@ perate with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ tional brain mechanisms . you will recover at some extent , just as in the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous rest , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkeys that reco@@ vering spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from infringement of injury .
it is not that precise and not so fast .
now you see , when we r@@ acked the cells , the same monkey , two months after the maturity .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use it .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example at Park@@ inson .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ore them in human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team .
BG : do you look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look forward to the future as many years it will take until someone will come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it is difficult to say .
firstly , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it has already been a long time to select patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric trial .
you must first re@@ point out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing condition .
we believe that capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely non @-@ democratic .
in fact , the democracy comes up with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- said to me as Finance Minister in the Euro@@ group un@@ ambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- cannot influence the austerity programmes that were realised in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my revealing friends , which would say to me that democracy would change if they would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe in working with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , believe that we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy our societies are in common , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed .
on the subject of wast@@ age , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin apple paradox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the Schul@@ den@@ berg ,
but only a few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , is too anxi@@ ous to invest it there , where it would be productive and income , with which one could produce school@@ ing and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro area , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will invest in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , and so on and so on .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars sound after a lot of money , until one compar@@ es with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions have ro@@ uted , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange and prop@@ elled the property prices .
so debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin Summit , which does not differ from the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ nating sal@@ aries , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the U.S. , Japan and Europe work out , and consequently a low overall economic demand that would not invest in which they do not invest . just like oil , the prophecy of the O@@ Thr@@ one could be true that his son would kill him if he grows ,
un@@ dar@@ ed the circumstances lead to it that econom@@ ists kill him .
this is my ha@@ ired with capitalism --
its extremely sp@@ aci@@ ousness . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further improve our lives , develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to save the Earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
I already believe . but before we continue , What do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society , in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ical democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there would be an error , the place of Ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these proportions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision of the ath@@ om@@ ic democracy was and is that they had the working arms , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mo@@ ods in questions of the state of government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept a long time --
like a candle that shines very light , it is also quickly hidden .
however , our liberal democr@@ acies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens .
but in the Magna C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been imposed on politics while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our present democr@@ acies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began to be a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two by which the economy gradually desc@@ ends politics and ma@@ sts them .
do you wonder why politicians have no more so than before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because of today that one can be in the government today , and still not in power because the power of politics is se@@ per@@ ed into the economy and the areas are separate .
I mentioned my ha@@ ired with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is roughly like a flock of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably nour@@ ishes the animals from which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated by the end that they are at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy , which the policy has so widespread in itself , that it grows by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are to frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; ru@@ gged the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; of democracy , the higher the twin Summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and the welfare of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; control the control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not surprising good .
the doctrine from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor reg@@ ain only through a miracle a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to create the working poor !
the capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ omy occupied by automation and robots .
the problem with this is , so long economics and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin Summit will be higher , the wast@@ age owners , and social conflicts deeper , just as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics and ensure that we meet the united area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological surveillance bug that leaves the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question therefore is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced , survive --
the interest@@ ingly question is whether capitalism is solved by a D@@ yst@@ eine , similar to that of the &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; or something that the society serve people and people are stuck to the research into the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so what br@@ ushing it , how could it look , these &quot; star tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ eine ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
in the area of companies : please make a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital , and from income , and the concept of wage work is completely obsol@@ ete .
there is no distinction between those that belong to the companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange of between capital and labor , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no empor@@ ing igni@@ tion summit .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely swing exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 major emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the whole of mankind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade will be tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , investment resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially in the context of a united politics and the economy .
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which they privileged privileged people , and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically .
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine true democracy .
will we awaken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we act on a political basis .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decrease in the overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry summ@@ ers are called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agnation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we do it up to date , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct then Marx is very relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ ary Marxist , and how key@@ nes , and that is why I am also completely wir@@ elessly .
BG : actually , and now we are at ease .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ led , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosop@@ hic explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you think of the view of the West .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the economy , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a certain way , if I must say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
-- -- remember -- we tend to unite liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a fault , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical of what democratic development concerns .
what you can observe now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done for themselves in the 19th century , dig@@ ging to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many li@@ sten@@ ers are curious about your experiences than the Greek finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I decided that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area ,
not only Greece , but the eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the constant denial that a massive escal@@ ation line by the eurozone continues and continues to massi@@ vely risk the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this denial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to do . unfortunately , the forces within the eurozone , within the European group , continue to denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one is trying to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one will perhaps be able to delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what change are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : do you have any mistakes made in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , claims he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , only because they did not want to deal with the faults , which ran through the eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to confess that it has led a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece since 5 years .
we lost one third of our nom@@ inal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of the don@@ or who has imposed on us this policy , and a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive test of talks , you seem to be still fairly pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if she does not survive , the acqu@@ itted fli@@ cks should be demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not be alone for Europe cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the most powerful economy in the world .
if we urge ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 which it appears to me , it will be as detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for visiting TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
by Roy Price the majority never heard before , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 @-@ sized minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading operator at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a refreshment and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technique , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making shows and content to the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ struggling sector .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are quite right on this bend .
this curve is the review of about 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that has been addi@@ ctive to ask your brain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here at this end , shows are like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- which should tell you enough what passes at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the turn because I think you already have special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean explo@@ iters , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon so doing something , therefore Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where everyone can watch free of charge .
and if Amazon vain stuff out there , then you get too , correct ?
millions of spectators have a look at these episodes .
however , they do not know they are observed during the look of these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can capture , when you start the show , when you are packages , which parts you jump or looks again .
you collect millions of data to decide the show you should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and it results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four republi@@ can US transm@@ itters . &quot;
you made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many people remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 amounts to and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for this a super show and he also uses data for it but it makes it something different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the latest data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these small details about the viewers : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four transm@@ itters , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x thus has a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very strange , data sealed companies .
they combine these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow fails to work with everything .
if you g@@ athers millions of data to make a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the min@@ de@@ te what you can expect is good TV , or ?
when data analytics thus does not work , then this is somewhat sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we hold more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does someone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever get into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail in the United States and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , which can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results generated . this is not that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google does not make mistakes .
2009 Google announced that it can be said by analy@@ zing qu@@ arri@@ es from flu , which can be predicted -- by data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a big message sensation . the success was in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked properly , year round year until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are sealed , such as Amazon and Google , sometimes dis@@ regard something .
despite all these errors they influ@@ encing data in decisions of life -- in the workplace , in legal dispute , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded Genetics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I realized a few samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
as a result , you place this problem in its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a part , you put together the items together to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just fine for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something where the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to come together again , even if the information is incomplete , so that the brain is incomplete , especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that is why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they have data and mind , where they are also in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would have been able to do . but the decision how to put all of these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used to control all their choices first when they we@@ ed by TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; alpha House &quot; as show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how force@@ fully they are , data is just a tool and not to forget that , this device is pretty useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- just here at this moment .
I will try it later on with a technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made some decisions made in my life so far , while I should listen to the ball in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much tigh@@ tened , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball will cl@@ ap and cl@@ ap , and cl@@ ap . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off , decisions to make , an expert in what you do is doing , and risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
