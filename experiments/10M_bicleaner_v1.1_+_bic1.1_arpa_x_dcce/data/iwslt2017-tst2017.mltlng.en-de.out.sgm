<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times Reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before each one of Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular published that the NSA heard illegally heard of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service, in which the CIA has literally drafts across Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter fell at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "almost 10 years the government has identified against risen and encouraged him to call on its inny sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistle-blowers and journalists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if the identity of the mug cannot protect them." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government landed in isen, he did something, what many courageous reporters did before him: he refused to go and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although she had no means for years, that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to leave.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rather than bringing down and cracks to the statements, that could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have concerned, without his consent, his phone calls are secretly concerned;</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit, and even travel tests with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Among this information they found evidence to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and Risens on alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has more sentenced to him than all the U.S. governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how one can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "so we put the PR for the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to pick up all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">However, just as technology of the government allowed to deal with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can get it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in testimonies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that had not yet been written as Risen, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the internet illustrious Aaron Swartz, and is today approved by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information to your usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spagestechnologies that jeopardizing us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology-inator such as Edward Snowden have a way of bringing offenders. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">The reason for abuses in the care of soldiers is humble and will be reported by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers who suggests the alarm for the polluted water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider that warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only committed to those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the "Panama Papers" was revealed in the "Panama Papers" [what does that mean?] [we baten Robert Palmer of Global Witness on a statement.] this week we were greeted by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosque Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosque Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a foe of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad envelope in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin conducts over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous about the next release, and on the next revealing documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the pellot of an agent or a John-Grisham.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying out by you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we let us know what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and mighty being able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret, tax havens will be used by some of them to hide and conceal their assets - something that we have been discussing and revealing ourselves for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people will appear this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always place it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these prayers.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"" "" "" "presumably, because there has been no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="64">Well, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after these tax havens work, Moslem Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a vision of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have links to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states you need to provide less information to establish a company than to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of incontinence in the US has allowed employees of schooling to leave school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has frauds allowed to rip specially anuts off.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this would like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work actually?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a capped investigators into the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself an African Minister, who wanted to bring demonic money into the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it really, that everyone could make suggestions up to a lawyer by our investigator, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preallegations. none of these lawyers participated in ourselves as clients, and of course no money was passed on to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual incidents.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single attorney who has made suggestions down to our capped investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leader, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability is established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules in order to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound all very vows, as if we could do anything about it; as if nothing had changed, as if there will always be the rich and mighty.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimist I really see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years, we have seen accusation towards greater transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind the spotters.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy, get up and say:" "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of incontinence through laws.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together we can end Intransparent, which now allows those kinds of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finish.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I once again kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazkeret.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design study, I made a backyard on sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked like my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a road trip through whole country. after that, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep today?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I do not know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him. he said that he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of one Mazowes!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "h, how to please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought: "Oh man! what have I got there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game-ranged in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of the bed, on toguts to the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he bought from me is now in his classrooms. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattresses, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommates draws off and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can make it easier to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have overlooked, how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and founded such "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on wood floors with us for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We traveled with them through the whole city. as we said our last guest, and the door fell into the castle, vigorate Brian and I ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came to roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented to investors: "we want to create a site where people publicly post their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, the type of room, whose doors can be concluded when you come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite people to invite people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">It will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who still is at Trost would invest in a shop, the stranger allowed to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as children all that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you have to be aware of the things that one can do. we could desigs.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to desiged objects, but now we wanted to create trust by the design of immense trust between people who have never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I'd like to give you a sample, what degree of confidence we put up.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your decrypted cell phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet anflug of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the slipped mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So, most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just once so, who has now actually Al Gorit's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you preach on Twitter for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name; if he would have told how he does, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations, which all say: "he can really very well entwined mobiles!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd like to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="175">Ultimately, we decided to wait until both the host and the guest had given their assessments before we created them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and housing.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, who are most like most of us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we rely.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social assimilation.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting it becomes exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by notations.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, it changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stickout similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can therefore help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reaction to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little as for example "Hi!" you do not get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "they tell a lot, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" -- -- "" "" -- the request will not be accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I make holiday with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with design to produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the textbox to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not reckoned was the great deal of people who were more than willing to locate these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front, when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of Anrufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the night had only a fraction of the problem of the 123 million, ever a fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, can be miraculously developed.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers who tend to tend to work due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with plenty of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real Guardian Angel that save life, even though they do not know it properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You travel to hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money campaign are exactly what you want to achieve with Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with counterfeit actions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it is an economic trade here." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is just" "" "Tenancy" "" "which is not just the case." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes an trade, which promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a portion of themselves openly, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, this is to be compared with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but this is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group there would wait for a group of Answer to fill a thoroughly and to show a bar of a pub that one has never heard before.</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from the ground to another?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities do the thoughts of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered by residents. students who were looking for a bleibe,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were pulled out. there were incubators programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone will be hosted by night 785 000 people in 191 countries as a guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing that we can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that intriguing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost to be overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I don't have to think about it if a red Mazda has gone over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it was able to help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">Is a believer? an Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I give you not the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study surrendered that 80% of the coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show the Americans, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Most people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met one Muslim: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you, who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegs-Fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual muscle.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outing me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why are you oppressed yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The Lusatia was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, namely towards the pressure, which I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt me to a perfect and untouchable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I wrestled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, figured in question, doubted and believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication which deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to the weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that somebody you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>

<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country to be attacked but in the Nu transformed me the actions of others from a bourgeois in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember the way I drove -- and so deep it went into my sitting room, and I felt the first time to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Muslim organisations that said," "" "be vigilant," "" "be careful in well illuminated areas" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of it.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also listened to Muslims or by people who held free for Muslims, and suggested for Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really burnt attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not true.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have turned the anger of the people into the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain themselves constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all the other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but an vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, heifer and Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make sure the closure of mosques is safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be a few parking spaces free, but not the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to regard people other faith tolerance and to show greater citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC recently reported: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, one has found that it begins online. as the first the person is cut off from her church, even from their family, so that the extremists who believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despise their behavior and ideology is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslimine, as a mother, as a person, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves into its imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology reasons on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you have a look at it, they don't drive them what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because they were fed to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with which she had spoken, she brought to silence and said to her, that their anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had given their anger sense, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by the extremists that gave their own solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection with God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of applying them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, such as the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day look at our democracy, to our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: when we fear, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We do not accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: when you preset Tested News in which negative about Muslims was reported, they were rather military attacks on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an acute problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims came up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two choices of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning-character.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear reladet to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectivism, it is not only about how to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous human being he knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is from my brotherhood of such a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne on her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, which was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after having posted statements against Muslims on his facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He poured out eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we left at the mosque, or remained we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We loved it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was a matter of what America we want to do to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery we drove to the mosque, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, moved my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, expressed himself and welcomed our guests, because the half of the gathered together were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, covings and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to see the number one?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who say, we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have taken a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinkers with deep access, are working in a posh monument factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, deceive you. I am totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever performed study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I have no exception in any respect.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people seem to appear as an exception, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler, is in short run to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug performance. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-net income in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flight machinery in the FRAC Centre in France live in front of the audience a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting air-systems reach high speed and speed up on a narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build a self-constantly pull-up structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to wear loads, to deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibility in the autonomous flight." ""</seg>
<seg id="415">Thus a system autonome works, it needs to know collective, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a list of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine position in space, determine calculations on board, which should do the machine.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be found at the highest level. e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">An airplane, trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">As other Starrflügler it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starches it can float, and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and improved performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide basic abstract questions that are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts, which accumulate to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots have been able to fly-controlled airinstruments, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a trope one.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong discovered we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the mondinner, the mechanical simplest radio remote aerator. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-ships, no further actuator or control areas, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, happens in inner life very much so that it can fly stable and can move into space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have an elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it right now, if all of me look, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the montains is a practice in indulgence, this machine is here, the omni-head with its eight Propellers, a exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the extraordinary capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space to all directions, no matter which direction it is turned or even as he rocked.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight Propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is conceivable in models, the rest is learned directly with flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If air-presses are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propeller wings.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When one builds them, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a engine or propeller drops out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make half an airworthy one.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic contenders.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows an array of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took wholesale Micro-Quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as there is a fine lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creations, to form it in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes are getting stronger each other than faster, you walked so the mass tribuls in a tenth of the energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment saw it brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they do not put your energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events initially for a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago, it was just a multi-dimensional life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought some things: corals, fish, plants, sauce, people and -- God is standing by us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- trying to find a huge laser detector, to search for gravitational-waves, which are about by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation has financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometry-gravitational-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of LIGO could considerably increase resulting in recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started for a last run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collious black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">You went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicists on MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a toning in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the temporary of the wave, the space and its entire content into one direction are stretched and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In view of illustrating lecturers in courses of relativity-theory often a really Algerian dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and reserving, stretch and reservoirs."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us stretched out the waves of the waves and gestures. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by one 1. of this one declared the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometres long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandel of a nuclear radius radius. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, hunting for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are forceful." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are Finnish and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott is happy, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial elevators, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for so you can make a picture or a map of things by pointing out the light from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With tones, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things which means you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">Around the face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like tape and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob disrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"duck Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce any simple pictures of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by doing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least are the measured frequencies in audible field.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transform wavelpatterns in sound, we can listen to all the literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity too loud, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has very busy with Scott.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotating holes, circers simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very quickly, one hear the same pair of circulation with an additional sound change. that sounds like that: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of motion literal, pronounced in the wavelform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- LIGO Folder: [Surrenches of the sound] Somand, who knows what he must hear, this is as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun-mass, which will turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 Sonnen, circling a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO ebnet has a completely new way to explore the Alls as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and listen to the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practical or fundamentally -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A super nova, for example. I would like to know why masculine stars in super-novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes occur but at the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through since these opies are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would explore more transparent glass. the Urbang I would like to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see it, since the Urbang is covered by its own pendant.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the gravitational-waves it should be possible to back up to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things we only discover when we listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found right in the first attempt things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague on MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this subject: me: the kind of stars, the black holes are observed, as LIGO they observed are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are the suction nodes for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO makes us a completely different point of view on the events in space, at the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we went forth out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories in Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say to all" Yes "" Yes "" "", "I was afraid of that." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say yes "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">I wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly that is what I was afraid, recessed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep my social anxiety -- Puff, weg.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" changed me. "" "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that deeply changed my life on an unexpectedly. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emeralson. and Emeralson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all the... "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I swear to play always with them once you ask me to ask. no matter what I do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I compelled me very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side-effect: only recently, I was fully understood that the "yes" saws to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author, I think things you want to live.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Create TV. I'm producing TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days once four shows, thus all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours on TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV shows are going on Thursday Saturday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts, which I have created, and not only produces, so still obendlessly. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollar, campfire that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you so all of you who work so hard if you speak now a company, a country or a classrooms, if I speak of work so that you understand that I'm not just rocking on the computer and fantasiere, and it is true when I say, I understand that it does not work for a dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all the blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deeper into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I set troops, when I was on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As well, you see a high tone, fly a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanically, strenuous, and intoxicating, funny and maternal, cruel and prudent, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the money.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change within me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the money laends like a bustling street, I could always drive on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people participate when I tell them the money, that I am writing to writing that writing my joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Understand me not wrong, this does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I began to work and work with television production as I began to work and to work, build, create, and work together, I discovered this thing, this money, this energy. the totals!</seg>
<seg id="618">The totals is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The money is action and activity. the money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the money is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a totals, you cannot do otherwise than after size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that can not be different from the same size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what we call the money.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I did not fail to fail and I just know that I love the money.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more the more episodes, the more work there, the more things simultaneously, the more you see me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more you have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the money, the money, the money, the money.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this money. I love the money.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the money. I am the money.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this money?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the money.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, exaggerated, overlaid, burned.</seg>
<seg id="642">The money stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single workbook.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emeralson said," "" "Look, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a title.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-tians.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when I heard the money.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine dustated.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The money did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My money was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, unworked weekends, no repentance, do not delegate a titanium asleep, does not give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV channels, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the money and the money I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly verbal?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know, some may think: "hypol yourself from, stupid the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you don't work, you love to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, Bill Gates to be, you just love one another and that gives you the totals if you know the money, if the money stops, who is you?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states" "" "represents a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late next, and she says," "" "Mama, don't you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" "" "kittens" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls no more "" "" kittens "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="676">When is it happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am at Titan and my buzz, and here all changes from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, don't you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters, we laugh a lot and I feel quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of the thirst, I can do nothing except that fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, quintal pins and the song in which it is going to let loose, or whatever the girl gets in "The Iron Curches."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathed.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is dissolved.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy club comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The money is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is silent, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the money, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The money, the working environment, the Titanic, this is just the substitute.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, when I tell you, who I am, when I complain of broadcasts and TV hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real money is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is not force and it is not working-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real money is dependent upon the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The money is the current one is coming from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real totals ignores the pressure of history, the dieting tasks, the expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real money is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God inspires me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this for a fixed rule, so that I can rid myself as a workaholic of any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the money again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't play as much as I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">"" "" "" "I am rather at the workplace as a home." ""</seg>
<seg id="726">This input is painful, because what kind of man works rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Time honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smashed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attacking my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the money of the universe meets me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naive, for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">You have probably right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show-figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"" "" "" "my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they wanted them to do something else." ""</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or Kek replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more it does not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring 15 minutes a piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are penetrated!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-feel, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to have the money to have a place for his soul.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">About the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it up.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I shocked and I siege. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"you want to play?" is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in my education, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 Minutes a piece, why not get in full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can it be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my spare time. the money seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door open up the energy flows and I find myself back in my office. I listen to a unknown melody, she fulfills me and my soul. she tempts me to new ideas. I put it again its way again. I take advantage of it in full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the money, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the money, the money is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The money of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The money of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The money of work is part of me, but just a part. and for this I am so thankful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's cool to me that I am a Titan Poker. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is even functional. my campfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the money, the marathon that I run, the marathon, the canvases, the high sound, the money, the money, the money, the money, the money, the money, the money, the money, the money.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling of living in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I awake you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live its dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dreamjob should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgery, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury of the central nervous system the patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was working with a functional neurosurgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, who tries to improve the nerve functions by means of various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the most prominent, the "Tiefenhirnstimulation." thereby, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuit circles of neurons so that neurological manifestations are improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered under fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With something help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading Oberphysician and worked in the emergency day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I ordered patients with skull-deer.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain is inwillted and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to diminish the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this one has to sometimes remove a portion of swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells of a gun race grow, is comparable to quite small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish them.</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts are Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know yet from BiologieLessons that stem cells unripe cells are, who can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small nut of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this kind of stem cells from the surface texture of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were surveyed.</seg>
<seg id="835">They went slowly and after a few weeks they had even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our big hirkrinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the foetus, they provide for the fission of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stick to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe they are taking part in the healing of the brain because we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not that safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, which enables braking healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-lingual area, and then the cells to cultivate exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they were then marking, in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we racked it on the recording position of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- auto-splant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we rhyming these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we rhyming the same cells in brad brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with ape.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we plasted the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that they had been removed completely after a few weeks, as if they were returned home, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not go there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added a injury to and rhyming exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were rhyrhyper.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also recover a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we fabricated apes with a manual and skinnate task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they reached a stable skill level, we seeded the hand motechnology in the motorized Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Subsequently, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they recover spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recuperate with the help of plastifictional brain mechanisms. you will recover at some extent, just as in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had achieved his degree of spontaneous rest, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from infringement of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not that precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see, when we racked the cells, the same monkey, two months after the maturity.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use it.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example at Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implore them in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal himself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: do you look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look forward to the future as many years it will take until someone will come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Firstly, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It has already been a long time to select patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that you have to apply this to a multi-centric trial.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first repoint out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging condition.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism is inevitably leading to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have undoubtedly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely non-democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, the democracy comes up with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- said to me as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup unambiguous that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- cannot influence the austerity programmes that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my revealing friends, which would say to me that democracy would change if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you to believe in working with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, believe that we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defective democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are in common, our future bleak and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of wastage, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin apple paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the Schuldenberg,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is, however, is too anxious to invest it there, where it would be productive and income, with which one could produce schooling and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the euro area, 3,4 trillion dollars will invest in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion dollars sound after a lot of money, until one compares with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions have routed, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange and propelled the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So debts and unproductive capital form the twin Summit, which does not differ from the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating salaries, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the U.S., Japan and Europe work out, and consequently a low overall economic demand that would not invest in which they do not invest. just like oil, the prophecy of the OThrone could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,</seg>
<seg id="925">Undared the circumstances lead to it that economists kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haired with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely spaciousness. all the unproductive capital should be used to further improve our lives, develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to save the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I already believe. but before we continue, What do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society, in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenical democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, there would be an error, the place of Athenical democracy due to these proportions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the athomic democracy was and is that they had the working arms, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same moods in questions of the state of government.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very light, it is also quickly hidden.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens.</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and economy was possible and the democratic process has been imposed on politics while the economy -- the world of corporations -- a democratic zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies has been held since the time when this separation of politics and economy began to be a relentless struggle between the two by which the economy gradually descends politics and masts them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians have no more so than before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because of today that one can be in the government today, and still not in power because the power of politics is sepered into the economy and the areas are separate.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haired with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is roughly like a flock of carnivores that sustainably nourishes the animals from which they are nourished, decimated by the end that they are at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy, which the policy has so widespread in itself, that it grows by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, the economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are to frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism the "Demos" rugged the "Demos" [the people] of democracy, the higher the twin Summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and the welfare of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" control the control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not surprising good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain only through a miracle a position as in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">The capitalism does it by replacing Niedrigloomy occupied by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem with this is, so long economics and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin Summit will be higher, the wastage owners, and social conflicts deeper, just as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we have to re-shape the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics and ensure that we meet the united area, otherwise we end in a pathological surveillance bug that leaves the film" "" "matrix" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has produced, survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The interestingly question is whether capitalism is solved by a Dysteine, similar to that of the "Star Trek" or something that the society serve people and people are stuck to the research into the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what brushing it, how could it look, these "star trek" -like utopia rather than the "matrix" -similar Dysteine?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please make a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital, and from income, and the concept of wage work is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">There is no distinction between those that belong to the companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange of between capital and labor, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no emporing ignition summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely swing exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 major emerging countries], in the interest of the whole of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "" "" "imagine that the entire world trade will be traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "Cosmos" "" "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "also imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world, investment resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially in the context of a united politics and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberated, in which they privileged privileged people, and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesianically, global keynesianically.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we act on a political basis.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for reunification of politics and economy... do not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decrease in the overall economic demand, which Larry summers are called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we do it up to date, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct then Marx is very relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, therefore I am a libertary Marxist, and how keynes, and that is why I am also completely wirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirled, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophic explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you think of the view of the West.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of the economy, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I must say that provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">-- -- remember -- we tend to unite liberalism with democracy -- this is a fault, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical of what democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">What you can observe now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done for themselves in the 19th century, digging to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences than the Greek finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I decided that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro area,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "for us say goodbye to the complacency and the constant denial that a massive escalation line by the eurozone continues and continues to massively risk the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity to be on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial --" ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "it is correct to do. unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one is trying to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, one will perhaps be able to delay a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: do you have any mistakes made in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, only because they did not want to deal with the faults, which ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to confess that it has led a catastrophic program in Greece since 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika of the donor who has imposed on us this policy, and a:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive test of talks, you seem to be still fairly pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if she does not survive, the acquitted flicks should be demonically and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not be alone for Europe catastrophic consequences, but for the entire global economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the most powerful economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we urge ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930 which it appears to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans and the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for visiting TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy Price the majority never heard before, although it is likely to be responsible for 22-sized minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading operator at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshment and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making shows and content to the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-struggling sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are quite right on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the review of about 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are given this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "" Game of Thrones, "" "" The Wire "--" "" The Wire "" "" -- all the shows that has been addictive to ask your brain: "" "" where is there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here at this end, shows are like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- which should tell you enough what passes at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not take care of the left side of the turn because I think you already have special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean exploiters, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time Amazon so doing something, therefore Roy Price doesn't want to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where everyone can watch free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon vain stuff out there, then you get too, correct?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators have a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are observed during the look of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can capture, when you start the show, when you are packages, which parts you jump or looks again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide the show you should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and it results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom via four republican US transmitters."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House," "" "but it seems that not many people remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 amounts to and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for this a super show and he also uses data for it but it makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the latest data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these small details about the viewers: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom via four transmitters, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"" "yes," "" "House of Cards." "" "Netflix thus has a hit, at least for the first two seasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 review on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very strange, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow fails to work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you gathers millions of data to make a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindete what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analytics thus does not work, then this is somewhat scary because we live in a time in which we hold more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever get into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, which can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. this is not that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does not make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 Google announced that it can be said by analyzing quarries from flu, which can be predicted -- by data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a big message sensation. the success was in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked properly, year round year until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are sealed, such as Amazon and Google, sometimes disregard something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors they influencing data in decisions of life -- in the workplace, in legal dispute, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided Genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I realized a few samples on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you place this problem in its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a part, you put together the items together to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just fine for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to merge the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something where the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to come together again, even if the information is incomplete, so that the brain is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That is why I think, Netflix was so successful, because they have data and mind, where they are also in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else they would have been able to do. but the decision how to put all of these parts again, and make it a show like "House of Cards" which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used to control all their choices first when they weed by TV-ideas, then as they chose "alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "we say the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how forcefully they are, data is just a tool and not to forget that, this device is pretty useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaor no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- just here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later on with a technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"" "" "" "I have made some decisions made in my life so far, while I should listen to the ball in the night." ""</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much tightened, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will clap and clap, and clap. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off, decisions to make, an expert in what you do is doing, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
