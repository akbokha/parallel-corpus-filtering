Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people are to be met today .
a greeting chapel , where now is buried for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers spend the rest of the peasants .
the oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is nervous when land@@ cards are not currently up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everyone who had to be exciting already times because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took place of a turn @-@ road a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are anything but up to date - but that is why very enligh@@ tening .
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a ma@@ kes@@ creen that can be seen as such .
in the big picture postcard for towns and communities became more detailed cards , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional leaf@@ lets .
this was produced according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ aging administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and derive from the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition @-@ war with Austria .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ er@@ un@@ es - of course for military purposes .
even if French troops were finally de@@ ported to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , 9 February 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours were created by the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph moved forward the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ aging administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ pos@@ ure leaf@@ let for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison morning / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling which appears in the map of 18@@ 56 yet relatively isolated .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich district .
today he is in the middle of the city .
the houses of the houses are concentrated in 18@@ 56 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ road that was only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : with do@@ zens of do@@ zens of lines and numbers : hand numbered copies from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ intake , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots occupy no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ er of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 sw@@ ings of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ pos@@ ure leaf@@ let , one reads in the territory of the present district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse you can once set people with mad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At the Au@@ er Lu@@ fting , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard from G@@ ud@@ den , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment of the psychiat@@ rists in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the bet of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
he has forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later on 500 places has been extended .
sometime , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of the largest psychiat@@ rists in Germany .
at the top of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now people are meeting in Mün@@ chner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order had the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 the children @-@ house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; was created in an architec@@ tur@@ istic approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ prison , which was destroyed during World War II in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ er@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a crucial change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a great one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a salad chapel from the Middle Ages had once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ railway line .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the a@@ erial view of today - and the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizenship group published travel report for Mis@@ souri
the National Federation for the Promotion of Brown has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Mis@@ souri because of the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Mis@@ souri , which will come into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sou@@ l@@ ans , while travelling through the state will have special attention and be noticed , as a series of frag@@ mentary , r@@ ally @-@ based accus@@ ation occurred recently in the entire State and stated here , &quot; said it in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law by Mis@@ souri , which makes it more difficult to win dis@@ discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to extract the tour warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are put together or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization issued for a State in the United States .
the Group quoted inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see .
S@@ anders died in late circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any more during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody without a crime .
the Council also pointed to a recent report by the office of the general state @-@ old of Mis@@ souri , shown in which black car drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than whit@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and informed their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri was posted in 2015 100 years , according to the latest figures from the wake @-@ up @-@ out reporting program of the F@@ BI , which str@@ aps the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the tour warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law , which would make it harder to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Rights Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) were issued for Texas and Arizona , after the States immigration laws passed , the local prosecution authorities undertake to with@@ stand people because of immigration and to contribute to further r@@ appro@@ ving the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel noti@@ fications are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the dec@@ eas@@ ed project is elementary
the fishing bacher Wei@@ de@@ con@@ j@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac got a picture on the spot .
at the v@@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann the representative of the fishing bacher CD@@ U office together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann affor@@ ded insights into its operation , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows and as well as many young animals provided and in five apartments holiday guests accommod@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter route for the milk of his cows , so pi@@ v@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Ferien@@ ga@@ este comes exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as it is also the B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ president of fishing bach , he declared the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot work profit@@ ably on such a steep surface .
the green space for a lot of work , much should be edited with the motor sense .
&quot; we have here to fight with the terms and conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ dem@@ ann .
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ly farm and built these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even though he does not lead to bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eption project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is happy about the leader of the leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
they hope that the affor@@ estation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and do thoughts as they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion
over the ordination of dec@@ eas@@ ant funding were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots from eleven participants .
the surface area is approximately 40 hectares that are not allowed to be affor@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the overall cost of the overall cost of 71 500 euros the half of the leader was promoted , a quarter carried by the town@@ ship of fishermen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the farmers f@@ aded 12 6@@ 10 euro , which had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ dem@@ ann .
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , with no farmers and farmers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White stood firm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ s@@ alo@@ gi@@ d ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ures .
the goal is the opening of the Black Forest .
pre @-@ requ@@ isite is the presence of one of the lungs marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the fence @-@ based surface must not be in@@ conceivable ( Hang@@ ing above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fishing bacher Wei@@ gh@@ ost project , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence .
the surface area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the pain@@ stak@@ ingly staged overthrow of Saddam H@@ uss@@ an on the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key @-@ ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic aspir@@ ation in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Mill@@ er did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de by boat owners and Liberty Shi@@ it@@ ators would have suffered it when he had done it .
but he laid hold of their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem which you refer to it was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
Mill@@ er is knowledgeable right , but as he formulated it itself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the ascending words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only load any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your exhausted , thy poor , / thy afflic@@ ted masses who desire to breathe free , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ ding waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Mill@@ er was not committed in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who put themselves into place their words after their death on the base - did very good that they did a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Re@@ public@@ anism , in which it presented the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she himself gives himself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and exactly like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to change from the right wing this for a long time .
the big scre@@ w@@ as rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty is not un@@ lock , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that the American flame goes into the per@@ sec@@ uted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something pushed .
the importance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative effect of Lazarus was to see them as they did from the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ ful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships was seen .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must listen .
and that is of course not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp will ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite .
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ aves Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two ch@@ ot@@ ters belonged to the team of Great Britain
the power direc@@ tor of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that in Scotland something special develops , and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue to go until we figure it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals An@@ wär@@ ter , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ tes - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the crew for the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were che@@ ot@@ tic or wherever they live or train , went out of space and were very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie was naturally lit , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal , which is played at its fifth World Championships in the 400 @-@ m Hür@@ den , says that it &apos;s &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ stretching mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another gr@@ otto that one should be observed after a great season which included the victory in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
she was reminded of her first World Championships as the only other S@@ otto in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing to be in this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway great honor to know , but to know that my team @-@ mate has voted for me and chose to do something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the car@@ rots who belong to the team .
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb onto Po@@ dia .
what my speech is concerned as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to set on this home@@ support and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I &apos;ll get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : Have you not to enter a public office if you cannot wear the inj@@ ecting of voters
the Father of our country knew something from poor press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers proposed him because of all , from the internal policy to its political principles .
he p@@ ushes in criticism , safe .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work on it , more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil liberties g@@ rie@@ ve him therefore at the beginning of this week .
the St@@ ab of the governor , left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the nation .
ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to deb@@ ating his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his site .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who will be paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and finally dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Spe@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of trol@@ ley or sp@@ amm@@ ers or water @-@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments dis@@ respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ essed .
the pastor expressed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ om@@ ca@@ tho@@ lic faith .
lawyers in Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ma of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not water @-@ filled , but she asked to hate hate .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comment field of the message &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people at the same issue takes place , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective action and not as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the governor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic or a negative comment will be deleted .
it is much clean@@ er than in former times when you had done the same that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines and to burn or to bring prot@@ esters .
but this just happens digital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official , that is critici@@ zed to Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tru@@ mp is lam@@ ents from Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County is last the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she named a vot@@ er from her fac@@ ebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor of Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect like the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ ly between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envelope attached to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous comfort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who used pseud@@ onyms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that Washington &apos;s decisions made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the Trade and the shipping with the UK , over@@ power their office , according to historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not brought them to silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days on local comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosted the 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who introduced next year to the Ar@@ ver field left until the end of the last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new au@@ stra@@ ort and has been acting as a tournament spokes@@ man on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reached his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry has made a great job than he set this place .
he is an ze@@ al@@ ous mad@@ ness of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales look forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly interesting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the native player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open because it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one that we will always value . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year for the European Senior Tour , returns to the action on the homeland .
this event will be the first Scottish presence since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you still feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lungs by passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive cancer .
this result is scientists of the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates are attributed per year 20 pul@@ mon@@ opo@@ cre@@ dit@@ dis@@ es on passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Studien@@ leiter Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as comparison , he entered a study of his own study on the subject of 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 pul@@ mon@@ opo@@ cre@@ dit@@ ations for pas@@ si@@ ties per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
pets are proven to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat more in the time , &quot; says the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house incl@@ usions , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because in the underground , there is much embarrass@@ ed , which is not stated in the plans .
the traffic , which is repeatedly imp@@ eded the construction works , represents a big problem for the part of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of the mot@@ orists before red traffic lights and sli@@ ces is already huge , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to the passage .

poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , they use no stove .
it even uses rarely a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Festival in the Un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually speci@@ fies a sweet@@ ener - located locally than &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the semi @-@ oh@@ or@@ ted Kn@@ ol@@ le is taken and eng@@ ul@@ ed with je@@ al@@ ted hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the backrest - it has no furniture - where it also performs its daily work , for example , wash dres@@ ses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a canopy space serves as a batt@@ ling .
as the youngest of four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any boxes .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is normal here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody hun@@ ted to walk around 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , as only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 El@@ der by a public lifting increase in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that revol@@ ved for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jakarta that maintains control of the region and excl@@ u@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitoring .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo designs , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated roofs , which have been converted by r@@ ust into various yellow shades .
only very few Indonesian have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , hon@@ or@@ able Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points on their lif@@ ter , hand @-@ made tur@@ ban , her dar@@ ker shirt and its bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is in the poor@@ er province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , grass berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles away from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
alone in 2015 Free@@ port was built in value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
in addition Pap@@ ua with wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are however a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesian em@@ powering military keeps a sustained presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military agents and units from 1998 to 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ tian &apos;s demands for greater autonomy are threatening this golden go@@ ose and will be gn@@ ant treated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been denied and det@@ ained since 1969 by the ind@@ on@@ esian military .
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ ua tri@@ land in the 1970 @-@ 1990s under the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission , in accordance with the Com@@ mit Gen@@ o@@ cide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police have found more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are Every@@ thing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to include in a report of the Erz@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane from the year 2016 , where reports on atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peace demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as each week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , because Pap@@ ua resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are populated by the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ anese food shr@@ ines sell baked chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ uss@@ i sauce .
local people are fighting to stand here .
&quot; migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Pap@@ ua to sell , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local which moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has tasted the local Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , formerly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , and said during his election campaign in 2014 the inequalities and violations of violations in Pap@@ ua .
the former Zimmermann was 27 of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a deep point in October for only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 kids was outside and sang Christmas party before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the scar@@ ed children said to them , that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an impetus at her tone and came later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hunt and swal@@ low the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers turned into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard sm@@ itten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and the things are escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered themselves together on a football field before the local police station and the military com@@ mand@@ ator to request justice .
they contributed to em@@ oni@@ elle hunting db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ sc@@ opy - by Pap@@ uas Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was refresh@@ ed , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal spark : &quot; if the masses can afford more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is not released in an official document by TI@@ ME , which has not been released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ p@@ end danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was heard in the mood .
&quot; when I turned to myself , I suddenly turned into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who was fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; adds it .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and under@@ went his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears a name like many Indonesian only , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kiss@@ ed him . &quot;
the Che@@ spec@@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers &quot; only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we need to defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner p@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were wounded .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jakarta .
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e to address historical ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved promptly so that in future it will no longer happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he will judge a court of court for placing historical human rights violations .
but the pron@@ unci@@ ations began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most violations occur a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations but there are processes that have to go through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the anto made a retreat than he spoke on June 5th in Jakarta with TI@@ ME and said , he has no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , which accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been buried in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ incident .
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ victims took against such claims with gri@@ pping un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still alive years later in fear .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was be@@ aten from the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the corp@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting @-@ shops have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the village and the manager of a leg , who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , died a person and 17 others were wounded , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned in a nearby river conf@@ is@@ cated , died on the way to the hospital .
the vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the location of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were stones on officers , who re@@ acted by making warnings .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and sle@@ w a sle@@ w .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be re@@ venge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who was in the vicinity of the hospital and witnessed how the finishing here were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ gated iron for the Indonesian government .
the lack of sensible development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the chiefs Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by em@@ itting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ des Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reaction , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai over the last few years , under the pretext of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safeguarding national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruits and leaf vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to deal with four or five fields of sweet potato .
you keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a swe@@ eten only 10,000 ind@@ one@@ al ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
during the course of time economic inequalities between local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , since opening new flight routes to Nab@@ il airport in greater numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported due to poor coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film has been given .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election , the limitations of reporting up@@ lift , to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March six paci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widely spread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting .
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
the speaker of the Indonesian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights inci@@ dents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the Human right @-@ ambass@@ ador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura attended the 4th of May , native indigenous their silence and oppressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended by meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia did another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is involved in the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Ri@@ vers , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is living under the constant threat of a Muslim military , located in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; you do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ i led a final symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ one : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they might know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with convi@@ vial head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , and has hundreds of inhabitants from the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years through the Hoch@@ haus , that is also called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries have been reported no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are at the fire @-@ raid and when scre@@ aming the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to arrive from the 50@@ th floor to bottom , &quot; told a residents who had his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building disp@@ uted .
the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected .
the incident can make questions about the safety of materials used in outer areas of skyscrapers around the world , revi@@ ving .
an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ Building after its fire in 2015 yiel@@ ded that the largest part of the damages caused by the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding to the decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a bran@@ ding in June , with approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen with his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup @-@ single is still supported on two chances , Hau@@ ling is not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the although often very long , but also so much appreciated five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the tradition of tradition .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only tight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member states have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the quality .
not until the vote was not only possible after the vote had come before the proposal to carry out the finals on a neutral place .
new from 2018 are just relatively minor details : the fin@@ alists will have the right to have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup next year in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in training places , etc. facilitated and players will have to complete less official media outlets before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings wrong objects to the aircraft , will find a survey
a survey among passengers sur@@ passed that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously poll@@ uted articles on the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent , which have the aircraft whilst they are acci@@ dentally deleted kni@@ ves or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed , they would have been delayed that they have been ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble with fire@@ arms , am@@ muni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed also noted that younger travellers rather mis@@ ses the rules .
by the respon@@ dents , the assumption that they do not know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ sely affected by T@@ SA agents were foods and liquids .
more than 3 percent gave to , know@@ ingly items by blades are carried by the safety control , whereas 2.@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents were also confirmed that they have been inten@@ tionally brought drugs to the plane .
the company said , it has questioned travellers across the country to find out how many accidental s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling were brought by the airport security and how many it would have been inten@@ tionally done .
there is no surprise that people , most of the best s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - do not know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - by security , those who were most frequent .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .
people are often uns@@ ure which liquids can take them or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items by T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated in liquids .
a time for the people , the T@@ SA could see books as a s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s customers to cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tro @-@ thous@@ end@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k will be pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , it has so far been propos@@ ing that a part of the customer has withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ umph@@ ant figures on sales increase and still stag@@ ger@@ ous sales aim , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has reported a different , less gl@@ oss @-@ balance for the first time : the cancellation of the cancellations with the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k has often applied for the new car over the past few months , whose delivery starts today .
now , Mus@@ k was a : from a total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn .
critics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely returned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , sp@@ ic@@ t m@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts .
that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders may become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe .
its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production page .
last year Tes@@ la supplied a 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
by 2018 we should put all models together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
those who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect only earlier in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la creates its brand new , never in practice tested production roads without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum occupancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the un@@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company can not prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from releasing them in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt draws themselves because of the hes@@ itation of the rules of Obama &apos;s Era to reduce emissions back
one day after he was lam@@ inated by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ sted , the boss of the environmental protection authority , his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g caused poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more effective than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous place in a federal profession .
it is a deadline that ran on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for down @-@ down o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he will delay adher@@ ence to his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ fere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma it was for a long time a reliable opponent of severe environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly repeatedly to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden reverse from Wednesday is the most recent legal envelope for the P@@ ru@@ ction Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Financial Tribunal in Washington decided that the EPA has exceeded its authority than he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ ane le@@ dges .
in a statement published on Wednesday , P@@ ru@@ itt said that his turn@@ around at oz@@ on@@ ados makes it easy to increase the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely performance of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier Administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not met the deadlines for execution and then waited to set an appointment for the execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who denoun@@ ced the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdictions , and we take time seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we also accept the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the statement of EPA , that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and any other legal available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader setting of o@@ zone arrangement .
one in the last month &apos;s approved legislation should delay the implementation of the Rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet placed in the Senate .
the New York General Secretary General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who w@@ ailed the EPA in this week , said the group intend to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our conditions - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who flows in their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York feature in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
bottom o@@ zone is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power stations , oil raff@@ ia , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and each year will contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of the public health system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ at about P@@ ru@@ sion surprising direction .
&quot; it &apos;s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this rational step from the responsible person responsible for the protection of air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to turn towards environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrate 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery A@@ real in tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July at 16.@@ 30 pm at a Seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius system a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors involved in their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique local treasure . &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the ministry &apos;s Ur@@ t@@ book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
the wording of the judgment on the tum@@ our mountain stood on the Tum@@ linger Berg but also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ orph@@ an Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent sett@@ ler of the village .
old maps from the period around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical conditions .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was born out of the earliest medieval equity law .
a Lord , who built a church , taken out and occupied with a pastor , continues to be in the owner of this church , and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars were found in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two sm@@ ash to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell then scre@@ ened for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later was released in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ den@@ sely .
17@@ 96 French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and ch@@ ur@@ pers and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church thre@@ aten 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger @-@ Cem@@ etery served as the last resting @-@ place for the dead from Ear@@ schw@@ eiler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche stopped .
only the cherry tower had been left .
in the New Year eight 18@@ 34 , a storm started the cherry storm and half of it cr@@ ashed .
in order to prevent an un@@ happiness , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ mar@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ her have been a successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ er , the friends and sponsors invite the friends and sponsors on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ te@@ is .
Local Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program begins at 16.@@ 30 .
the admission is from 3.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
for the Aus@@ k@@ lang of the Seren@@ ade a trunk can be found in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers provide the fantastic view out .
the Seren@@ ade takes place only at Tro@@ cken@@ em weather .
the organis@@ er hope for many supporters to preserve the historical St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of importance for tum@@ our and listening .
the friends and sponsors feel particularly committed to the home care , such as Seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Mart@@ ini confirmed .
association wants to prove permission of wind@@ wheels
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim for@@ dri@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal requirements for construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; is we@@ ed &quot; by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association argued that at the time of approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette had no wind turbines to have been approved , since at the time in quad@@ rup@@ ed only on the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal is a wind @-@ strength concentration camp .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy for the remaining city area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cut @-@ out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days before by amending the floo@@ d@@ led plan for a second wind @-@ concentration camp at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but which had not been approved by the District Government in Düsseldorf because of a form of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of planning the necessary permits , the authorisation is un@@ lawful and therefore also to rise again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current state of affairs : the city council once again decided the wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette in front of the summer break ; a approval of the District Government is still out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; creator : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , at this point , the creation of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been taken at the circle Four@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes on the occasion to prove the matter again .
but they are not likely to imply that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing procedures at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday wanted to express itself as regards to the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind@@ wheels .
already last year , the company had implic@@ ated in which the town of Vier@@ sen is implic@@ ated , p@@ eigh@@ ties with the owners of the approximately 65 hectares of great terrain .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of approximately 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the current demand of all quad@@ rup@@ tive households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the past summer four @-@ line town@@ res@@ igned green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
Auto and tractor trucks : woman dies in horrible accident
one terrible traffic sun@@ fall is suitable on Friday afternoon against 10 am at L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn ) .
a woman was in@@ ju@@ red .
two more persons have been in@@ ju@@ red .
the provincial road remained closed over hours .
according to police statements a 17 @-@ year young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took her passenger car as part of the accompanying driver with their 53 @-@ year mother as an accompanying person the L 333 in direction Bo@@ gel .
town and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region should re@@ discover the shopping area in September .
the commercial association and the municipal authorities wish to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the local residents to the city center .
as the president of the profession , Christian König , announced the &quot; Home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend , the customers will raise awareness of what offers the own city from the usual supermarket product .
consequently , there is a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
moreover , the firms are supposed to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite you to the &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night shopping . &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are available on the radio , an internet video and printed bag , which refer to the Ak@@ tions weekend , as Christian King .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables the commercial association and the city into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest with all estates and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and sale on parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed and re @-@ opened again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many indigenous people would have lost the city center while shopping from the view .
in the end , all of them need to contribute to the inner city - to land@@ owners , the businesses of the whole city and Ver@@ einen .
it started to overcome the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network which was part of the world , had told the king in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen with that to participate in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gia cities .
besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this Weimar , S@@ ö@@ vol@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ lei@@ cher@@ ode .
the day sol@@ le &apos; for &apos; appreciation of the local trade and make its significance for the common good of our cities stronger , &quot; said Stre@@ ich .
the action in the au@@ spices of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also make it clear that each citizen could be influenced with his purchasing behaviour directly .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work it came to a gas erup@@ tion in the school building .
new further people have been in@@ ju@@ red .
in a gas out of the US city Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine more viol@@ ates , some of them are heavy .
according to the fire fighting fire on Wednesday ( plac@@ emar@@ king ) was still a hur@@ t@@ ful in critical condition .
a human being died as part of a school building with the blast .
a first mixed later was also dead @-@ born .
with the dead it was the staff of the school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as un@@ fortunate , the authorities were supposed to work on a gas line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the holiday period only a few people stopped in the building of the Minne@@ ha@@ ha Academy .
Tru@@ mp continued by phone call Mexico by phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tru@@ mp called for a phone with the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. President described him because he refused to denoun@@ ced the wall to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not what you can say to the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and schw@@ or , Mexico to pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
trans@@ cription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and un@@ covered a tense exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ stein , that a trade for the USA refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia will take over &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; and &quot; sil@@ ly , &quot; and that the existence of the trade , which was carried out by the Obama administration , had proposed him as a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after it had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , after having said Mr. T@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ Mass@@ acre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury was accompanied by a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rested on the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men joined forces to block its path .
the captain of the mo@@ obs - a man middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ xed strike - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looked testing by the wind@@ shield .
inside ho@@ vering the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brood @-@ man of man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
fear cr@@ ush@@ ed the silence as a young black man was sm@@ ashed from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , just a post .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all in the audience are very real si@@ gh .
since 2005 citizens come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was charged ever because of the murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks that helps in organizing the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a strainer on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year former congress member of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for action as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of medi@@ ums lays on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files that were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding Graf@@ ships were susp@@ ects in the Lyn@@ ch process .
but none of them have ever been indi@@ cted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizen in Georgia for the first time , in the pre @-@ voting fight in the summer its voice .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to information of the F@@ BI of the black far@@ mp@@ tuous Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle down - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that smells in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried her , did not get from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ in Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b mo@@ b the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who made the Mor@@ de and ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; includes a F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a full gap between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , evi@@ den@@ sed the identity of witnesses and divor@@ ced the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks are still form@@ idable .
&quot; it was an electoral mass@@ acre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost a decade of course , C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is des@@ crip@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is founded in a kind of deep racism , from which many believe that in America it is no longer exists .
it &apos;s hard to look at , and even more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is the point .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ne because we are confronted with its ugly in all of us , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wheat and the rest Black - in a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ C@@ lan@@ der membership for years , but he never said the role will never become easier .
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and be@@ wil@@ der it , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappeared from my own property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona extingu@@ ishes the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter made .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ti@@ ch@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t believe that white people were &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wit@@ t one of the other black performer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it is precisely because the energy out in the room , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie will replace the discomfort .
everyone is busy doing this right now , not only because of the game but also because of memory of the four fo@@ etus people .
the scene starts again .
this time , if Ras@@ cona das N @-@ Word says , he says it sharp and with im@@ prints .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is non @-@ violent and fast .
there is horror , shots and then silence .
a woman , clo@@ th@@ ed with a mour@@ ning , stands on the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads to endor@@ sement Holidays , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks up every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen people swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost ev@@ enly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down just down the road .
they all had nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive humidity , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ rison had an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de served , the air feels pen@@ dic@@ ated .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ens invites you to come closer and insp@@ ected the corp@@ ses .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the counterf@@ eit blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as if he wants to remember it .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks Gre@@ ens - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ s@@ eil weg and wi@@ ping their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ ded Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the move that has played the C@@ lan@@ der .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ ded two of his fellow players and breaks together into their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience is composed with the actors for dinner .
chat on a table a white couple from Atlanta , excited about the post@@ ings with a black pair which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought to find words which has left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do what you like , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me does makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still continuing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the only police officers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks farm looks at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the citizen &apos;s rights .
he said , he had already begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the follow @-@ up is in some way inspir@@ ational , because she describes the hor@@ rors of what we have to bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;

the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
turbulent times are celebrated Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , which leans towards Merkel and the hands of Merkel @-@ smoking .
great applause there is for the concert band , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat in le@@ ased leisure clothes .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his regi@@ sters .
in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to leave a striking whi@@ stling concert on himself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; one noted that the audience has grown with the &quot; ring &quot; in some ways , she had said briefly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown an understanding of its approach .
I prefer a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as voluntary
they work at several places in their internship year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in furniture , once a week , I help here in Gre@@ ven in the Furn@@ ace bridge .
and I have already worked on the school in an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late freelance volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I have made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully abol@@ ished .
I have known for me that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I wondered what do you do .
take a social year since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it so ?
many : I have collected great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will start my studies in the winter semester in the winter semester . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social @-@ work training and study at Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not something unusual during the Volunte@@ er to have several different locations ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always comes along where you will be the FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from anti@@ quity to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that has dressed me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really proceeds .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : na clear , here it is not about to count st@@ ati@@ ken .
one always has other people in mind that each have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager has been taken out of the family - you always have to address them individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments even so life is just .
Pear@@ son cr@@ ates further 3,000 jobs and over@@ thrown the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British Education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will build more 3,000 jobs and cut off their intermediate divi@@ ding to 72 percent , since another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure by which the company is faced .
the job construction , the Director @-@ General John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and beginning to 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 places .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by a quick step towards digital learning .
the company that had vo@@ iced its involvement in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House in the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after the first half @-@ year achieved a growth of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in assass@@ inated attack
a su@@ icide @-@ assass@@ ination has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato and several other hurt , say official .
five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded , a statement of Nato .
according to confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , three civilians were killed .
bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan reached this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a su@@ icide @-@ assass@@ inated two people killed near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato means the explosion was held on Thursday night , as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; of persons &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement suggests that all the compar@@ isons are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , of which about 20 % in the capital .

EPA returns decision to del@@ ve the smo@@ g rule after law@@ suits .
the US @-@ American environment protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , by which the states are obligated to include the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 countries agreed the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA approved late Wednesday Wednesday to advance the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone Pro@@ visions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to specify the o@@ zone Poli@@ cies - in which in a part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be measured to comply with tigh@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year to October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , travelled on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal .
the President of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental impact that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which should stimulate economic growth , according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
however , the efforts have triggered the withdrawal of Democrats and reserves , which are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can reinforce the breath @-@ symptoms , &quot; as for example as@@ thma .
community wants to become common areas
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counterparts the council acts of flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a communal space in the future sen@@ iors .
prior to the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining land section was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although it will still take before the area of the parish church belonging to the municipal land , there is now no plans for the project from a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project more .
there is a discussion with regard to a shared space .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would have a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 m ² of space for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and majority of the municipal law float above , such a common room cannot be seen as the meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ iors , but open into the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word made of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is made by the provision of funds for the current household already last autumn , by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation areas .
the establishment of a communal space would be , so called T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent are eligible .
the resolution proposed to signal the investor to sign@@ aled to him in this respect is that both Satt@@ el@@ - - which is in this respect - as also P@@ ult@@ d@@ ding - which reduces the tear @-@ height and construction of economic power - which could be made possible .
need@@ less , so do not only mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously happens to the body .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t move so much for it is now in the common room of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne coup necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a co@@ vert sub @-@ prevention in any case benef@@ iting or even foreign investors .
that is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface I give no allow@@ ance , but come a real , in doubt , is the counter@@ part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers &quot; request , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sub@@ mits &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; finds three supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains in two counterparts in the original program that summ@@ ed Stefan H@@ aller so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hike in the resin of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the national park is to be the first &quot; star@@ ch path . &quot;
this is planning the club observ@@ atory St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary way is there in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come contrary to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ atten@@ de@@ es , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and sports performance .
members want to show up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and star patterns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase through 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good achiev@@ able installations at five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ qu@@ ests St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards are to be added by the internet .
therefore , at the location of thousands , a good mobile network reception plays a role .
also accessibility is a criterion .
later , the Star@@ pf@@ ad train is supposed to be extended by train .
&quot; at the star@@ ch trail , the viewers find much knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
they learned , why stars would have different colors , or why a star stronger lumin@@ aire than another , although it would be far farther away .
it is also possible to convey in which constellation can be a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the Berg@@ isches Museum St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest situated observ@@ atory in North Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is part of the Federal Office for nature conservation on the six dark regions in Germany .
frequently they are from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy with naked eye clear .
since 2003 , there has been at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium for 2003 something like the planned star@@ ver@@ g - the planetary way .
starting from the Born hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary way leads with its st@@ acks up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and for the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community equal ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the st@@ acks with the single planets - including the dem@@ oted plug @-@ in Plu@@ to at the end point - are placed exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a sphere of 6.5 millimeters diameter , while the height of exactly 75 meters from the sun is about 70 cen@@ timet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun till Plu@@ to is needed for about eight hours , ped@@ estri@@ ans need a good hour to the bar with Plu@@ to .
ped@@ estri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to next Fi@@ x@@ star would last even a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia who should stand in a col@@ l@@ isi@@ on@@ sk@@ urs to staged the most thrilling box@@ er in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ written World Bo@@ xing Council body champion , the hallway went down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ spring champion .

Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How is it to you , Champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends its belt against Miguel alle@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple of photographs posi@@ tional , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas , that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; .
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; I have risen to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on body weight .
and he must move on light@@ shaft &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko voted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clim@@ bers asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in their body &apos;s weight battle in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked to him later , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and continued to fight later on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other name can generate this kind of attention .
when always they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he says Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; a huge fighter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is very slow , I &apos;m sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ key ... you wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ko &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built himself for his own battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I have waited for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four cont@@ enders for tire plat@@ ters
during an accident on the A7 were partially in@@ ju@@ red on Thursday afternoon four people .
after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 hrs shortly before the connecting station market , probably after a tire plat@@ ter the control over his vehicle .
the passenger was s@@ lugg@@ ish to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ threw himself and then sat down on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were heavily in@@ ju@@ red during the accident .

Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; Tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 for the season opening up against Braunschweig , that brings optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
the first season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result as well , would not have been the two oppos@@ ites at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the defen@@ sel@@ ess of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangle is to be optimized also further .
and a gate after a break , the Fort@@ une may also no longer be cat@@ ered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be like no more to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will better cope with the experiences in the preparation with the three @-@ chain , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ture .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helmet Funk@@ y , but Hoffmann is to be certain of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the thirty @-@ year @-@ positions in KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well . &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is that we have even better harmon@@ ize and we cannot afford to build so many waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ sl@@ ated start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are able to concentrate on Sunday with four points and we will certainly be able to concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly talk about a proper season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to know his coach .
&quot; the start into the season evaluated only after six to eight players , &quot; said Fried@@ helmet radio , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken pre@@ matur@@ ely because of a we@@ ather@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can practically start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said radio el and Hoffmann that players from Au@@ e might be even a little fres@@ her , since they had no he@@ avier and complete game like Fortuna against a ascent in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 @-@ percentage where they are at present , &quot; says the defense of the Fortuna .
while guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be more easily favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) final Stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we put it away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is ble@@ ck@@ wise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ y , whose balance sheet is quite positive in only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that one has to hit from the start , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas boss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so he will not want to experience funk@@ y his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um @-@ review tests published
the latest results of test for asylum seekers in Sweden who have under@@ gone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ ens@@ ische Medicine ( EC@@ Us ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they shall make the assessment of the age in a more precise way , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration cuts ) because of errors in jud@@ ging the correct age of some refugees was critic@@ ised .
to date , migration cuts 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person is &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be &quot; possibly under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results were established in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics last months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has suffered over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases giving &quot; suggest that the signed person was 18 years old or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical treatment assessment , performed in the X @-@ rays of wisdom @-@ teeth and resonance @-@ recordings of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it safely , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; he told the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult un@@ correct , is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday there was a seven tons of heavy emphasis on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , builders at the Department of Road@@ and Transport in the Committee of Govern@@ ments Freiburg .
in April the work began at the same time on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the construction is scheduled for October and L@@ asi@@ ly is certain that the schedule is respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come to the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three components are now thoroughly re@@ mod@@ elled .
the other two bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , and 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called breasts .
this is a side attachment that is used also as operating away .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2,@@ 20 meter width is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian went on to it .
the particular thing is that it is about production parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already covered with the patented fr@@ act@@ ories .
special finger@@ sp@@ it@@ zen@@ ry has that embarrass@@ ed by wires through the Bau@@ werk in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass cable where many firms are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ craft over the project .
furthermore , first fish and canc@@ ers had to be f@@ ished .
for bridges between the building blocks and the collection , the traffic in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated via a traffic lights through one traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bro@@ ws are approximately 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful at German potato salad
it &apos;s not so frequent that parties are moving to a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ for@@ D ) , together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties involved in the K@@ rei@@ et &apos;s volcan@@ ic parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belongs to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites you to a large electoral shift .
and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , which constitutes the peak of directors for the parliamentary elections on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Federal Republic of Stor@@ ch .
however , who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ amen , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel stays colorful . &quot;
originally the city @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , will now take place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ell - and therefore directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ d event in the Stadthalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could easily eat the Af@@ ales , &quot; says the woman who brought him to her .
the police have frequented many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D have actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes told by the Af@@ i@@ volcan@@ ic fel , he tried to get such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking is available .
so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : against 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz offers a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ian Af@@ d @-@ Chair Uwe Young .
in the room are about 200 li@@ sten@@ ers , who are waiting to keep the top @-@ did@@ atin for the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty chief executive officer of stor@@ k their speeches .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
somewhat more than an hour , the Af@@ d event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short distance after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can push back - no special inci@@ dents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets tro@@ mb@@ one
a re@@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ l@@ acher mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the Kloster@@ kirche .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea in Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ con@@ dol@@ t &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have o@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orchestra .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ one of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines himself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ ri@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classic , jazz and free games to a fascinating overall artwork .
this core part of the programme has been performed only this spring with a total success in Freiburg .
the prestigious composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with their particular acousti@@ cs is deliberately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat him until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their bis@@ exual .
&quot; when I say in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh this was cool , what comes as a neighbour ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Horn@@ í stars was the one of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately went up bitter .
despite all the ass@@ ures the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ ar opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in any serious love that I have been dat@@ ed .
or do you believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten was to be bis@@ exual , &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism and seriously believed in it .
so it has never been confused or ham@@ per@@ ately .
I just liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially these suffered them according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time as they prefer to dress like a bo@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bug .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public she does not like to love her love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and anno@@ yed me .
and perhaps I call myself to be und@@ am@@ ble , but I don &apos;t like to be able to justify me before all the public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he switches the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said governor .
&quot; today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of after@@ words ... today I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp said previously a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , which is according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes makes certain that he has coal mining in five states , and have inherited a carbon business by his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday Saturday evening announced a declaration in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democr@@ ati@@ cal party which would rather work for us than to work in order to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 Gover@@ nor and the control of the least legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice just the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , introductory message , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for intelligence @-@ sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping sc@@ andal but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be recorded again in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress at the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct out of the sport and that he is determined to fight the intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which were made in cont@@ ests in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the ban adopted in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded intelligence doping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself , that it has experienced quite a hot times and do everything possible to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes are started at the athle@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at IA@@ AF Council .
sad@@ ness for in Mali cr@@ ashed soldiers
in a grape celebration in the North @-@ ess@@ ische F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar some 1,000 people of the two were thought of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security measures .
for even un@@ explained statements , Defence Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) nothing .
they called the two re@@ ge@@ es pil@@ ots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ti@@ led us against this highest sacrifice , which they established in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year Major and the 47 @-@ year staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday a week in West African Mali .
their offspring were transferred to Germany and transferred on Thursday by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
on the lunch we took only the families in the church goodbye .
after that , the fun@@ eral party began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among these were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorrow and ro@@ ses were on ro@@ ses , the relatives were standing in arm to the sin@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers took the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense ministers of the Le@@ yen made the soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decor@@ eted soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sail up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pi@@ er@@ cat@@ man made the operation of the martial arts tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilot of his reg@@ iment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , then there would be no mo@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was no doubt about the UN &apos;s Mission in Mali as prime minister in the Le@@ yen not : the dedication is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral ceremony , the S@@ är@@ ge were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they are best@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
prince Hen@@ rik does not want a tomb next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried alongside his wife after his death .
this divided the royal house on Thursday with .
traditionally the Danish kingdom will be buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor B@@ j@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already confirmed a coff@@ in @-@ ha@@ g for the two .
the Queen was with the decision of her husband , it said further in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to join his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a h@@ ehl from it , that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would gladly be king .
in 2016 he went to retirement , and also puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not have the title and function he wanted , he sees himself not as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the boss , the Danish kingdom house .
where the last resting @-@ day of the 83 @-@ year old will be ultimately , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to join his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the past 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Nob@@ ility , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Thames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always imp@@ lied , prince Hen@@ rik in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es had a heavy stand .
in an auto@@ biography of Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival became everything I did .
my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk be@@ amed instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ ges , which I smo@@ ked off instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , and the reputation of this country had the reputation to be the soci@@ alization of corporations , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants to swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen
low @-@ purpose Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a swift re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because I spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green Members from their Land@@ tag fraction in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the country @-@ term elections , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ essa established their move with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for choosing 2018 in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( P@@ unch ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated her on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ leader B@@ jör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record them .
with this they would have both CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new land@@ day will be voted on 14th January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green government must now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority .
Stephan W@@ eil keeps it indispensable for indispensable , that the land@@ day decides as swiftly as his self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its action on Tuesday .
the state of the country also provides the opportunity to withdraw the trust of the prime minister of the prime minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these options must be legally checked and &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ wes@@ terly step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the policy himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it distinguished itself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the exhau@@ sting dep@@ u@@ ties to the return of their Land@@ s@@ and@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she received her Land@@ tag , that she has received over the Green State list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ires &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the background that there was no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot fail this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chan@@ cell@@ an@@ did@@ ate Martin Schulz condemned the trans@@ gres@@ sional Green Members El@@ ke T@@ ast to CD@@ U as betra@@ yal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green Members in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal in red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the Chief of the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SD@@ P ) to quickly choose the farm .
the exit T@@ wes@@ terly costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their final marriage and in their frustration , their personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen makes this dirty in@@ dem@@ a and tries to hit political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ knowledgeable CD@@ U @-@ leader B@@ jör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his members to absorb El@@ ke T@@ alle into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , bow@@ ed T@@ AM , with personal career , the result of the country @-@ day elections 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy .
the CD@@ U was at that time prior to the SPD , the SPD , SPD and Green had a hau@@ led majority of one voice in the land .
agriculture minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about si@@ ties eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking about the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect consumers from poison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers and to review the eggs in your fridge and review the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ de@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the affected eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all we are presently aware of a health haz@@ ard virtually excluded .
now Al@@ di takes the best crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Minister of Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately turned up immediately and is since announ@@ cing the bond of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment methodology are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade has just as the manufacturer to ensure that the goods sold are safe and un@@ question@@ ably harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if if in eggs , the maximum level of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are not access@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the companies to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the current knowledge level the production facility meets no immediate fault .
rather , they must count on account of suspected illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is little control in the harvest case .
is it lacking only at the staff or at the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
however , there were just the official controls that have un@@ covered the procedure .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be eliminated by 100 per cent .
precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s prosecution in the cases where crimes can occur , of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a number of times since I expect a complete clarification of the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular al@@ arms in the food chain really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to solely ensure safe and safe foods .
if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food sector is used , consumer consumers and consumers are rightly indi@@ gn@@ ant .
due to the wast@@ ed means producers , traders and consumers have been in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
generally it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ animal animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it must be consistent on all levels and worked with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect the competent authorities to solve the situation in a fast and seamless integration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to impact the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European foot@@ wear , N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain does not distur@@ b .
any consequences will be coming for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization , which monitors the European game has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G will eventually have to point out that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 2@@ 62 million US $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a content that will amount several ten million dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mov@@ ing to France .
PS@@ G can make sure the money cas@@ ually loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ went and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich mi@@ stress @-@ family of Qatar .
associations must apply for the purchase of players a lot of money , but need to deal with legitimate ess@@ ays that allow them to ste@@ ak the break @-@ up point in their own football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini in his election as a UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their pursuit of success , effectively frau@@ ds and ris@@ ki@@ zes to ruin if banks or owners have moved their support back .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ amo@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then vigor@@ ated vigor@@ ated to improve the team and to build a global brand - to be a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P exp@@ ir@@ ate period that will run until 2018 , clubs can take loss of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A follow@@ er Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to terri@@ fy a excessive amount of expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , facing The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out @-@ clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the solvent claims for the next five years can be reported in the amount of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received an imprisonment of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players remaining .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs which might try to over@@ take their financial account by placing their income by enterprises that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could be spon@@ ges the PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ sig@@ nia .
this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was held by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar over payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar could come to Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Ambassador will be left and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators will be simple to figure out .
the past sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive each attempt to heed the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , say@@ est on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since it was not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 5@@ 4@@ 2.@@ 4@@ million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published yet .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ kot@@ bon@@ ding .
the association is assum@@ ing that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers to see , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s displ@@ aced by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial intelligence &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily newspaper in terms of Qatar &apos;s official ownership of PS@@ G .
ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a State which financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new shock supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced for the Swiss .
now the s@@ alute is ahead of a possible end : the airline writes the order new .
Swiss speakers in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ as a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Airline in the first half of 2018 will include a new contract .
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spe@@ ech in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red wr@@ aps of sho@@ ot@@ ings to 14 grams per year are distributing the passengers in front of the passengers per year .
the Swiss does not want to make any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry &apos;s total value will appreciate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the mig@@ ros @-@ subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is always the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer , it is a pressing order .
how many applicants are in the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss .
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
according to the newspaper Die Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wanted to renew a renewal of the Treaty establishing spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate panels distributed Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets .
the possibility of placing the logo led Swiss before two and a half years with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
in long @-@ range flights the customers of the First Class with treats is spoiled by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ inkl@@ gli , in Business Class rhin@@ estones passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short track , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes into the &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; to the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of Gl@@ ory David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wer the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV turned ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; First Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his sou@@ thern@@ most lob@@ ors ( it enth@@ uses a original story for speaking dry vegetables that was talked by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by getting around at the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ aged children play football children who grow up - nevertheless they created the im@@ possibility to reg@@ ain the last part of the jo@@ ck .
&quot; ten years , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults is less emo@@ tionally @-@ rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy bears more after the found@@ ry principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years , such as &quot; The Hand Side Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand which led the cradle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character of an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and &apos; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wer ) , now Roman@@ tic ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still has not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot , included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wer ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ made impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the courses are the best part of the franchise .
it is particularly great fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ pavi@@ lions of &apos; Sing@@ les &apos; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it is the moments random mad@@ ness that could heat this franchise , like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series that I reached as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : T@@ w@@ enty years , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now recalls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even an &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ewood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , created a found TV show featuring the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which fight for truth , a@@ the@@ ism and the road of Marxism Lenin@@ ism .
the main tro@@ lling - a hard @-@ called Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful gases for watching ( the police spends the time considering chess on TV , how Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ ers@@ li@@ a Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ l Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides for a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the truth of a dou@@ bt@@ ful propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it often plays as a single one .
with six long episodes , it draws up and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; which was re@@ directed to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re was better deliver , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef used again the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big males who is a bunch of bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian origin@@ als were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have been a blow against the Italian Maf@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , tomorrow , in Black @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ district , in Rot@@ ary , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart were looking through numerous objects , such as the prosecution Con@@ stance of Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 alleg@@ ations of the age of 25 years and 77 were arrested and already arrest warran@@ t against them .
in addition , the officials asked greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundreds of Euros .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
the two will probably be shipped to Germany .
the action was involved in Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators .
overall , over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia becomes organized drug @-@ crime , heavy violence , tried killing and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mailing .
already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance is determined against organised drug trading in the South East Germany .
between the prosecution in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a real exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Red N@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the large amount of action on Wednesday was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the vision@@ aries of the studies were above all Italian nation@@ als with a relationship to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
even a incident took place on May 27th in Hü@@ fingen as early in the morning several k@@ isses in a host @-@ site were likely to go to the bank account of the Ban@@ de .
way lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens that should not arise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report describes significant shortcomings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedure .
the Federal Commissioner for the refugee management of the German federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen means , has reported attention to a media report on large gaps in the cross @-@ country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resulting in an analysis based on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the register it is estimated that ten million people are recorded with foreign nationality , including about 5,@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore administered by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts so far has not been good .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and no longer appear to arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data entries can slow@@ down dramatically &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it means the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about travelling people , the EU citizens are captured , who would not have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , such false arrangements led to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with travel time , therefore it is in analysis .
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously started to send refugee families with under 16 @-@ year children back to Italy when they entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , the BA@@ MF is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF @-@ such procedure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related to families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Convention , the EU is responsible for refugees of the EU state to first reach them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrants are travelling to another EU country , this state can return it to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to substanti@@ ate the Office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made a guarantee for the reception and the accommodation given by families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) do not consider these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU countries would send refugees to this agreement as part of the Dublin Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten thre@@ aten human rights system and the haz@@ ard of the child labour . &quot;
further results are achieved
in a total of 220 litres blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people the blood @-@ endemic was already made available to other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of the major Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has moved to 50 liters of blood with his now 100 donations .
traditional appreci@@ ates the community in the meeting of the council , the multip@@ ly willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ous as our body is laid out for it and we are respectful of the don@@ ors respect , which provide their blood for foreigners , yet un@@ selfish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single ble@@ eding helps more people , &quot; explained the roundabout of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the con@@ den@@ ces are distor@@ ted into their constitu@@ ents .
in this way three people could benefit from one blood circulation .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions taken in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 divisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ General Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will likely be announced soon that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and mi@@ tig@@ ate inflation of inflation led spec@@ ulation through a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain as they held interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members increased a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly assessment report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 percent and warned that pressure on household income would continue , whereby inflation in fall is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but they have sign@@ aled that in the next few years Z@@ ques@@ tioning would be necessary to breed that of Bre@@ xit hal@@ ted inflation and she said that the credit cost would possibly rise more than expected to rise to the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h @-@ economic package that was issued before a year after Bre@@ xit .
it will request time for finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks , although it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds even more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households will continue to prevent consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interest rates repeated , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was needed for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets predi@@ ct the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that enhancements would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and next year will be forecast for this and next year compared with the 1.9 % and 1.9 % compared to those expected in May .
it has maintained its growth forecasts up to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell to these messages compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint growth pay the rising expectations on a line ca@@ vities and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the latest In@@ fl@@ ation@@ report provided little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by an increasing inflation and a little higher elev@@ ations , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing is first worse , before they get repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot prevent the break @-@ up in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that the wages to the end of their three @-@ year progn@@ osis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to the low Po@@ und , which will compens@@ ate for a part of the lower consumption fees .
the decision has come a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which resulted in the sin@@ king of the blood @-@ causing .
the bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will be fully achieved by the prices and the economy .
before the final judgement of the Bank to the interest rates the call has increased after a sign @-@ in , as inflation climb@@ s pressure on tough households , whereby three political decision @-@ makers in July had demanded an increase in 0,5 % .
inflation has declined in June to 2.9 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected and will be moving again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said , the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ t Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the s@@ wap market , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again since the len@@ ders are sil@@ enced by shops and would like to end this year in a positive way .
the market is particularly good for those who finish the existing De@@ als and finish the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to disp@@ le@@ ased about HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transformed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a proph@@ yla@@ xis of proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infection risk by approximately 86 percent , now estimated by the health service over a first three year @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he ple@@ dged to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice last year after the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the argument that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first ones that will enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced to all England in April 2018 .
prevention of proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV supplements which should be taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transfer in infectious diseases .
Pr@@ EP prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come to question in question belong to gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known through anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a home@@ opathic , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivering medicines at this week following an international competitive supply .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP by collecting clinical recei@@ pts , as it is implemented in a large scale and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should become the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV supplement and over@@ hau@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted towards needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in September , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS financing attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now needs to be out that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test has been accused , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after monthly delays and hes@@ it@@ ated by the government and over@@ due .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention can be and the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the large living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ign@@ ated 2014 by a large house in knee gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold their bags .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square kilometers has been fully over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a tel@@ ev@@ ous layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ vial storage space and a mezzanine to best use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
to this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to make the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for yod@@ els .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms super@@ se@@ ded so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine , in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative , in order to solve the default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked up over each other , without having to leave us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about creating a simple platform , but to attach the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place Er@@ fan , two rooms full of height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the mezzanine a classic clut@@ ch window looks down by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
the gold @-@ powered gold furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne ac@@ z@@ ente and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination put the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .
in both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to take him longer .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window to another room .
at the entrance we mir@@ r@@ ored units for all cut@@ ters and glasses of yo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space the beauty of the living room can exclude the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely important so that when you shift the door , very easy to slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and a improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and to use at the same time quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you don &apos;t forget to put yourself into the electric so@@ ckets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square met@@ e@@ ages of something default in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not .
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar property .
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate imperial Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors of his younger brother Paul , which led him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family since 2014 but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers received 38 real estate in value of more than half a billion dollars , collected since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there founded the West@@ co Je@@ ans family and grew into a chain of 160 retail outlets .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the ci@@ ci@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . bullying and shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eas@@ ed father , Col@@ in - von Paul is described as &quot; main driver and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s desire and Paul about a third .
a judicial representation that this means that Col@@ labor@@ ers possesses ownership in the value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assess@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in proposed him with what I held for the best objects &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed authorities , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims he excluded him .
Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but raises Paul before , some possessions are in@@ competent to manage .
in an early se@@ id@@ av@@ ite that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to put the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage writes about that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with affair , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading Law@@ yers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and of both sides to be firm law firm .
Mrs De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ acy to be operated in the late 1950 @-@ 1950 and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in Col@@ in the first je@@ ans family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped , to pass their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars for leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L committee member and following a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV Icon .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case before the courts be .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul chose to disgu@@ ise me and draw our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not think that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new Stab@@ at plans to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
if so , it will be the first .
poli@@ tico reported that the new Stab@@ at of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an equ@@ aled course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ at of the White House , at his first working day , he received a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s of White House , which he was repaired : poor information coming into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to en@@ umer@@ ate Tru@@ mp by super@@ vis@@ ing its media .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television dates back decades - and now where he is in the White House , his TV advertisement is still strong .
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was anno@@ yed because of a fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were persu@@ asive , &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote in time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter @-@ habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials in it , ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter would ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridic@@ ulous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign bears something that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have any more igni@@ tion included without their interventions .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ et , the Tru@@ mp has not sent .
if his staff has succeeded in keeping it away several times , anger of it , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently pro@@ hibit it that Tru@@ mp calls forth controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by promoting Tru@@ mp materials that may possibly promote their views from the world .
poli@@ tico - completely occupied with this history - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors , the President for strategic reasons to make du@@ bi@@ ous information .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press releases , above all such with damaged le@@ aks , and that he will figure out to find out where these originate .
exactly this happened at the end of February , when someone gave the President mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ vocation , Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty rod in K@@ atie whale s@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pi@@ le to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson had been banned from Twitter for a long time or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past and revoke it withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Stab@@ at Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the pap@@ er@@ work . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mast@@ ery crimin@@ als receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the cooperation of the population will pray and hoped .
the police in all of Europe are ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to a dangerous criminal on the run .
as the addresses of the requested heavy duty according to not known are not known , hints from the population will be up@@ lifted and praying .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action following the &quot; Most &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent Calendar of winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many refugees hide in holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ eu@@ mo@@ st@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times this year .
36 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 of the online search results could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to publication on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Big @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back again with some def@@ ender travellers on war fu@@ ß , who have negotiated one by the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to call for a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have called their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aires &quot; series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and a army of transpor@@ ters after they were k@@ ic@@ ked out in May without being deter@@ red by one of the council issued by the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense systems and expressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have said the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said , &quot; They are pulled back on Monday after they were sent out by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame on implementation , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved forward and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long sub@@ instructions to protect their parks .
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my common power if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
a local community , who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridic@@ ulous , we have just seen the last round of this trav@@ eller , just to pl@@ under@@ ed from another round .
the numbers have been raised this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized bearing on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can continue as soon as possible .
to support our motives collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation where the Court must check , when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house at the gates of Fre@@ den@@ stad@@ l is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof through the then ambience Operating gesellschaft mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , it was lost about 30 000 nights per year and also revenues from the city &apos;s tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , there was dramatically increasing numbers of refugees that came to the district of district , the hotel building offered at the district council , as well as collective accommodation , which ass@@ or@@ ated for controversy over the controversy .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a design plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not controversial at that time in the community .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ Mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and said at the time of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ yi , with business manager Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary auction house in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ chi@@ al .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , park Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been in front of the entrance for a longer period of construction , and if you enter the house , what extensive renov@@ ations are made .
the so@@ ils were ru@@ ined , blankets to partially demol@@ ished , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms removed .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large be@@ atable showers , the entrance area is converted , there are new windows built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything was to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewel out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but at a up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ aller .
individual holiday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
talks with whether Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause have already run , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
even the exterior plants are brought to Vorder@@ mann , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard you will find a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special acqu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ President of the US @-@ president Donald Tru@@ mp , Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand jury according to a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee in the past weeks have recorded the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under appeal to the cause of familiar persons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensified .
the CN@@ N reported that there are already first artic@@ ulation of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us @-@ intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for a longer , targeted at the presidential election competition in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s electoral team and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Re@@ public@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to report , Mu@@ eller got more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment among the magni@@ fying glass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Sch@@ mitt@@ edly Tru@@ mp I personally have moved into the centre and the accus@@ ation is whether the president has disabled people in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove and decide on present evidence in possible wast@@ es and decide whether it is to be charged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand Law@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are therefore also called Pro@@ Cham@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mostly they are switched on when it concerns bigger and controversy .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the prosec@@ utor &apos;s prosec@@ utor to charge people under o@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N channel the inv@@ itations were already exhibited , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called it in the report .
in addition they should provide documents .
next to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. even Tru@@ mp@@ s advis@@ ers and mother @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ nation @-@ election chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort he went with the conversation .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in the U.S. TV , that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller will not break down in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the composition of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason to concern President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President of the Thurs@@ days took an address in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion he know nothing about the creation of a Grand jury .
but these also work usually in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House feared all actions that accelerated the work of the special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey was told three times that it won &apos;t be established against the President .
you have no reason to suppose that something has changed , it meant in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was however only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had been frozen .
because of this ration@@ alize the accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp were loud , he had hin@@ dering the judiciary .
Com@@ ey was referred to a Senate Committee in June before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp was asked for an attitude of investig@@ ators against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure due to the examination .
after the representation of US media the White House is gathered against the special medium and its employees .
the extingu@@ ishing spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wants to release .
unlike an independent special medium of Congress as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later President Richard Ni@@ x@@ on , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be denied theoretically at stake of the President of Justice of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend such a step down .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic Sen@@ ators put on Thursday law@@ ns on Thursday , after which the special publicity could no longer be released .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant Eis@@ berg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arctic , a gigantic ice of ice has solved itself from the short @-@ seven scale of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
das distributed the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar - und Marine Research on Wednesday .
of over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer big pist@@ on pull now to the north and will probably be two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
it is a length of 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest r@@ ate@@ es that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people is not affected by him .
to what extent the climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of ice , it is unclear in research .
however , there has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact .
the opinion of many researchers can communicate with the global warming .
the now un@@ broken pist@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow even further into the sea and breaks up regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula .
north of this flock was the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ om@@ iting several years ago .
a complete ace @-@ fe@@ is was destroyed there , writes AW@@ I @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the front edges have never withdrawn as far as at present .
moreover , the ice plate stand under voltage and could dis@@ integrate if at a key@@ note a piece .
the mel@@ ting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg increases the level of sea , since they swim in the water and get ice so much water as it yields after the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the frac@@ ture is that the glacier can flow directly into the sea before and much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in low measure , writes the British research project to the observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I @-@ indications of almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly off .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y by the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed .
among scientists be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is now going to grow again or in the long run , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers do not withdraw the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in the last decades a lot of ice @-@ cent@@ ur@@ pers of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula are destroyed .
this long voy@@ age of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the research programme of British Ant@@ arctic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has declined since the 195@@ 0s around 28 000 square kilometers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the decline , the temperature increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ant@@ arctic peninsula has gone by around three degrees in the past 50 years and with it the areas in which the temperature was fastest .
CD@@ U wants a hood if the staff
because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free positions , the CD@@ U demands out from the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the K@@ rei@@ day took 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now once again 17 appren@@ tices placed their first day of work .
the courses in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications have been listed for the places in this year .
nevertheless , the circle will still lacks personnel to cope with the sc@@ ended requirements and tasks .
currently there is still no positions at the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to now take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to oppose the skilled working angel in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is to work out according to the wishes of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but forward @-@ looking @-@ oriented of the application stage , is called it .
the overall concept should be oriented inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a traine@@ e @-@ offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this has been heard in a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personal problems , which you didn &apos;t know before .
other towns promote good official and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ nat@@ or may be eliminated from the service .
so the highest time to action is thus no longer un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , with his party still goes beyond the common request .
he was already sor@@ row@@ ly already in the day for a lazy surprise when he posed the personnel expenses public in question and the other parties were stun@@ ned .
peoples want all the possibilities to be verified that allow an exit from the municipal employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come here at short notice at a satisfactory solution , the county administration should seek with trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a hood if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials tries to pay better than it actually sees the collective service for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed , enhancements , or more money , there is only if one changes into a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms have had to be set up , in which employees will take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direc@@ tor Martin Richter is a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened up the tone to NGOs &apos; migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given NGOs to use the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean sea , warned that they may not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t write a new Code of Conduct , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ e@@ niti@@ al warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized the boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; because their team worked effectively with human hands in a way that ligh@@ tened the illegal immigration .
the relief organisation which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express themselves on detailed preliminary ps of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can all accus@@ ations that are currently up@@ lifted , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ettet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , supervised since October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is alleged that his crew will take bol@@ ts migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from human hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler can cycle , so that ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least such a meeting , just 1,3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the state of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of preventing over the authority of the Italian coast @-@ guard , the lif@@ ebo@@ ards in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the Code of Conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have on board above all an Italian police officers on board which monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep themselves at the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable as they do not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate @-@ organization physicians is without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti said , meanwhile , that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy , had decreased strongly in recent weeks , that efforts to strengthen the Libyan state and cooperation with the local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

there were three of three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ - and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led with hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .

console instead of law@@ ns - Bundesliga touching for E @-@ Sport
are the sport stars in future against computer consoles , instead of being confused by wind and weather over the stadium ?
fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious growing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative shop - large stars , million fans and huge tournaments with high guns .
they have also recognized the first German lig@@ ations that are increasingly engaged in this field .
the beginning of 2015 of the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer playing FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to get a brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that there are still several clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the coming weekend , the Football Association awarded FIFA in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other .
besides form@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified .
even Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Lever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must argue with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people still go into the stadium in future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract one could be present online by far more often on these markets than once in the year the federal government to send to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; when e @-@ sports , computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Le@@ gends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; D@@ ot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sports , li@@ gen established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian @-@ play e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly more common .
also In@@ go F@@ seals has a long time faced with the question .
for Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ tho@@ chschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tively and find many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
furthermore it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response ability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also exercise their body and take care of the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport .
positive highlights the scientist emphasises the high integral effect of the e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally travelling , this is like a great global family , there is no intercultural shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federation of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , it was produced in Germany 50 million euros , mainly on advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments .
in three years the turnover of 130 million is expected .
against the almost 2,@@ 4 billion euros in the Bundesliga . this is little .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
international is a lot of countries already .
major markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ Bas@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US Team NR@@ G .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ er@@ Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe too , too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sports had been introduced as educational , says F@@ rob@@ ber@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the first @-@ first @-@ line associations are committed to Dut@@ t by now , to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Executive Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and to clear the old times is no longer enough .
it is a question of preserving the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time align it in the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; also says Dut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you cannot keep in mind that only when football remains all the way it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , which will push Con@@ rad Roy for su@@ icide , sentenced
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because they encouraged their friend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation in jail and five years were exposed to currency .
Carter was condemned in June because of a casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unknown .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal .
she was faced with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy has suffered an psych@@ ic disease .
dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ colored fl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down , when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended up his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but car@@ ters At@@ tor@@ ney said it was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that makes them completely de@@ plor@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find out that their age or maturity or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is no day when I pray not the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that he is proud of me and how to deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity , for his sisters is to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys Si@@ ster &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted by the knowledge &quot; she will never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I was together since my birth , is a pain which I will keep on me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; su@@ icide &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters &apos;s text statements revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hung up , springs from a building , do not know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news , she had sent them in several weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything you need to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judges Mon@@ iz told that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ord@@ ained that it should benefit by any press from the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended the Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced in Italy because of the murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before it was released two years ago .
Mrs Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run at Audi Cup as captain , is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut to the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a great season - Extra motivation is not a@@ det .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which looked at Joshua Kim@@ ba immediately , although the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er came to see , he made himself assigned to him at the arm .
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bayern Cap@@ itä@@ n .
good , the objection could have been better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach could also indicate me so .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth players who cho@@ oses and had just been chosen from the holiday professionals of existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game leader , but he .
sugar is disper@@ sed in the de@@ ar@@ est thing about those you want to keep in mood .
those who was au@@ ch@@ ores was to be found , the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation just fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ att@@ ened the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m above the field .
right behind , this is its position , the white Bin@@ ds on the arm did its rest .
and at all , I would like to be at this start @-@ up , like the one who can best take the rest into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the im@@ it@@ ated tro@@ upe .
he had the gaze of the whole , while many others were occupied with themselves .
Vid@@ al thus , his lack of fitness to play ( folding hardly ) ; Renato san@@ ches to get out on the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as South are not adver@@ sely affected in their first appearance at Bayern @-@ Tri@@ kot .
this all was folding very well .
South went next to Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both acted sou@@ ver@@ n .
the well @-@ occupied Napoli @-@ storm was often difficult , moreover , moreover , in the game building quite a few times successfully .
his colleague Rud@@ y gave , that the result was not that way we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed at the debut a decent performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shift shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed this Bavaria @-@ world still is for the re @-@ accessible , one saw following the game .
Rud@@ y for instance gave not one or two , but destined six or seven interviews .
for me saw a few we@@ ary statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there , he heard a very interesting sentence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Bayern you simply have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , he does not have to join the New Testament . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor Economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year , in which the new Minister for Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .

Frank Nat@@ us , president of the Association Tri@@ der ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around looks Nat@@ us in the infra@@ structural policy : the brid@@ ging of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now on the top of the primary list of the country .
this year the Ministry is hoping for a plan of planning , until 2005 the building is to be right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West @-@ in Trier , which represents in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urgent need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to take the route in December 2020 , says mini@@ stries in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .

envisaged is a premi@@ ums of 1000 euro for the best master exam and 2500 Euro , if graduates are employed independently within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned street building be quickly facts to create , at the same time lacking in the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main business leader of the Chamber of Trier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 56 new engineers , Wis@@ sing wants to set the Wis@@ sing in mobility , are now only 29 places occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls to award more orders to external offices .

Audi should change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - deal@@ er@@ ors are faced with a bac@@ kl@@ ash reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer the software to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said , the company is the opinion that &quot; it offers intelligent options as the driver restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - Diesel Cars to ban or limiting .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of automobile manufacturers , plants for neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to be installed , also assume what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indi@@ cted to pamper the powerful electric companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules if a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions .
several employees were charged by Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former manager of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal inquiries , after the authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Audi accused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have a system installed in order to deal with emission provisions in Europe and a request that was concentrated in the United States has been extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the examination could be Volkswagen heavily : the luxury automobile manufacturer bears proportional to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the best @-@ published cartridge cart@@ oons , the Kn@@ ol@@ l@@ enn@@ asen of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian @-@ Argent@@ inian possesses and works on a film .
his message : Lau@@ gh@@ ter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he attacked himself among other things as illustr@@ ator for congrat@@ ulating maps - what it was frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when in my job , he said once .
after St@@ ations in Lima , New York and Paris he managed his breakthrough in the end of the 60@@ s : with the publication of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo was a lot of fans .
repeatedly inspired to the artists of cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures c@@ avor@@ ts in drawings with the shal@@ e Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he sits his own indications as well as on the sign @-@ table , works daily almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches find his dro@@ ught figures still much distribution worldwide .
for six years he also has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los of any test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thousand @-@ fin@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which 2019 is to come to the cinema wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore he puts rather on the TV series , which is produced , as its original design@@ ations , is produced .
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to that of dro@@ ught rec@@ alled conditions and because of the disease propag@@ ating insects , resulting from scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the agr@@ arian Institute of CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender del in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the impact of climate change during the last few years and much more in the fall .

among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and slow@@ ing the slow@@ ing of the dark from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that res@@ ili@@ ent over dr@@ y@@ ness .
the little town of Ge@@ isa celebrates its own 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Weekly Rio@@ gor@@ ce usually meet in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Z@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with granite , or they let them go home .
safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abs .
there are drug control , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no glory of violence , and during all the land the corp@@ ses were common , there are more and more journalists coming here : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter , their editors and their inspir@@ er of Rio@@ gor@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and being a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
its absence is felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing its middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the façade of the Rio@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , carrying T @-@ shirts , who show his sm@@ iles face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ Bar was established in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only has introduced two criminal proceedings .
as with the most thousands of murder , which are associated every year with drug stores and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rare in court .
at Rio@@ gor@@ ce they still insist that the violence of sin@@ alo@@ a is to treat , although it is unknown , and even though the terrain is now more obli@@ que .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety , says I@@ barra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know the reason , we distr@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15th Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Rio@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve river . &quot;
the scor@@ er went out in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans Ver@@ sions last year and the delivery into the United States in January , Z@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloody batt@@ le@@ ground of the country , since ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of exposed , two @-@ story mouse @-@ mice for drug royal , which are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Rio@@ gor@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , there was the release of a interview with Dam@@ as@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ ography in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected of the members bought each specimen of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
the second fault was in fact not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to his own safety .
Val@@ dez has been a legend of Mexico and abroad , and its kill@@ ings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues survived that he would always be there .
he was active as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Rio@@ gor@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journalism , without referring to the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
in time the newspaper served as a call for the coura@@ geous and honest coverage , and the sales and advertising took place .
re@@ porter loved it , hard and excited studies without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories , which no one could deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the creation of Rio@@ gor@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they go .
he was voluntary that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug stores in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in the past October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you must take the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do before so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rio@@ do@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the spa @-@ bird , who was like a harbour worker , the friend , who was gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
you trusted on his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar across from the office , and there always sit on the same table .
now she ask : was his love for routine his corruption ?
his death has also comp@@ elled them to ask their own assumptions in question how they do the best to do their work and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret run@@ way , and run@@ ways to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ keeping .
to trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if there was wrong , stay away .
the anger is , the editor of the Rio@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es is Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a not more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees of Rio@@ gor@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before became known that Spy@@ ware sold , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen under the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were tas@@ ked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Rio@@ gor@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ range area of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the re@@ porter asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who declared the governor themselves as not trust@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug makers are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Rio@@ do@@ ce has in three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an extr@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group which in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the Pro@@ sec@@ utor , which led a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was offered , when it was time to write , what everyone knows in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite venue of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter was recorded from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy leader who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) who ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ Govern@@ ors were accused of anti @-@ kar@@ mic cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter of writing about previous inci@@ dents in this Local , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
only a few months ago , the reader would have seen the Colum@@ ns of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Re@@ por@@ ters Miri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ ap a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez were killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and be@@ amer say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country journalists have become more vo@@ ci@@ zed by having organized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this day is the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to pick out journalists and bring it to them , because they have said the truth .
she has since been asked to be divided by the government because she is concerned that their anger has violated its objectivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , participating in government officials and a consistent society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter was not only killed by drug gangs but also on command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has adopted more than half of the attacks on journalists by police and officials in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico we die , because they want you keep the mouth down , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ etas Kart@@ ell : &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer stat@@ ute and ear@@ phones stood next to their separated head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ d@@ ant Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez was publicly directed at the drug card with an editorial , on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted down the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was assass@@ inated in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico @-@ Stadt three months after the escape from Por@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay back and continue the work , there is a daily dance with risk decisions .
I@@ barra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets is that the drug stores him frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became re@@ porter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Rio@@ gor@@ ce began at the side@@ walk before the office and tran@@ ken beer , as at once all their phones began .
a series of shooting with band@@ ed v@@ als and security forces near the bath@@ or@@ ted Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed t@@ ote .
the war escal@@ ated on how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the g@@ ams you have published the news on the website of Rio@@ gor@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ aters in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards stopped to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they showed it not .
under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose central @-@ finger was visible for quite sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Rio@@ gor@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; how you can only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; when the same day when Javier was assass@@ inated , the practitioner asked me to send it to the street on the street . &quot;
dinosau@@ rs use cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to so@@ ften up his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable Nas@@ horn of a Canadian Berg@@ ner were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they could even determine that his love skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; in@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ paid dinosau@@ rs , who ever was found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ treated condition has researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ar@@ mor@@ ed crop @-@ eating the best preserved fossil @-@ style of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , G@@ mine .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock at the circuit , and decided to watch more accurately .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy o@@ ks .
after all this hard work the finished outcome is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you are just a little bit fl@@ ashing with eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature has to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this crop @-@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with a armor and a changing shell , most likely of meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding technology , which is used as a counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to turn its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild beast and it called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ers marked by the Muse@@ um@@ mer@@ ist Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen , made it possible for Dr Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and form of shed and arm@@ aments about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defence method in animal @-@ rich , meaning that the head of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the con@@ cre@@ dit@@ ations is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living in today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by having enough pressure due to meat @-@ profit dinosau@@ rs that evolution has beneficiaries the confrontation as a means of survival benefici@@ ary .
but most cont@@ empor@@ y animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ aded - are much smaller and hur@@ ting than loo@@ t , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ vor@@ tier behaviour on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors have been to have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was red .
scientists continue to examine the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his conc@@ ave officer , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs when he died , went into a river and sank into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time , Alberta were as warm as the south@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it remains completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ated skin , but also in three dimensions it retains the original form of the animal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little bit with the eyes of horror , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , lived for millions of years after bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ry ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ ster .
the scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology will appear , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta has failed after death in the sea and was buried in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near to Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , G@@ mine .
according to the museum it is the un@@ covered dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it enth@@ uses two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long peaks that were ra@@ ged from its shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed crop @-@ vor@@ es was bra@@ zed by the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded into the open sea .
but the underwater captiv@@ ating of the dinosau@@ r keep his arm@@ aments in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ ump@@ y armor plate along the dinosau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it will .
hidden remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y panels that carry the sk@@ ull of the animal .
his right foreg@@ ut is at his side , his five fingers crossed up to the top .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : massage bol@@ ts on A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ ts .
there are numerous Ver@@ last , kilometres long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , late Thursday morning at a mass@@ acre bol@@ ts has been violated around 20 people .
after the first details of the police were against 5 : 00 between the linking of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , including probably also wagons , inter@@ locking .
over the exact number of compar@@ isons , no data at first does not occur .
it is light to moderate severe injuries , said a pol@@ ishing pre@@ cher .
a big listing of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was totally locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich it formed a couple of ten kilometres long .
as an a@@ Z re@@ porter reported it came also on the counter@@ way to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ carriage notes the characteristic signs of the vehicles that now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. the second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car vehicle and a passenger car .
a Res@@ cue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost every one has experienced before : nothing escap@@ ing you sitting in the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
the creator come and awak@@ ens an uns@@ an@@ ft or put the rider in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently checks the managed travel card control .
one simply confirms the mobile phone that you have taken his place and de@@ valu@@ ated the ticket .
currently , a test run on two routes runs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get the offer to expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the rail card handling without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to use the one , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already do most of the passengers already .
you also have to have bought it via the app &apos;s app , the DB Navigator &apos;s app , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket receipt .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you rise to the train , calls for its ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test will then appear a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation .
the tractor companion get on their mobile devices a message that Driver X has taken on the train and has taken the bu@@ ked seating area Y .
comes the tractor companion for driving control at square Y , he knows that there is a passenger on already ent@@ enced online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent .
the check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; anyone can travel without ticket control through our train staff , check in the DB Navigator just yourself .
this enables guests to make their travel time on the train personally , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Management of DB Fern@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often train moves , knows that besides delays and missed the ticket controls among the greatest off@@ ences belong .
for many times you have yourself , in any case one of the room@@ mates do not have all the documents that one needs for the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either missing the credit card or credit card payment or otherwise a document you have to point out .
the result are endless discussions between traction managers and pad@@ lock , which leads to worse mood in the part or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the Schaff@@ ner at the end of time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test clients can use the new service .
and this is just for the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brittany Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken unto their core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was born in St. Louis in the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child and it is still on the road &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be@@ wil@@ dered , because no one else had posted the information , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly used on their tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live on twe@@ et .
he post@@ ed a picture of Brow@@ ning &apos;s alive body , which was spread on the road and would stay four hours there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone to return later on the evening to T@@ we@@ et about people on the Can@@ field drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , the cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brow@@ n@@ n father , who contributed a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live @-@ feed at which a polic@@ eman in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ished dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , escaped another polic@@ eman , and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of Fer@@ rell at their statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to and which we can typically call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ wering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the sight of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a cau@@ lif@@ ter and a suitable crown according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two gave a conversation that they had numerous times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not remember how far I have taught you when black people are struggling to believe in what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded them of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
I could not take her , &quot; Fer@@ rell was later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of its ... what happened in the past .
it is necessary to know and to see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the different layers of black experience and of the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the happiness to give you an experience in which they personally experienced no e@@ kl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is not different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would give you a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was a camp for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there are Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner .
they prepared bags and hal@@ ves to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape in Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after the 9th August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met for an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to only &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rell into the mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites in a community that benef@@ ited by their pain and durability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Go@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ ct @-@ Ins@@ ulation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his engagement brought the project closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years after browsing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
in@@ consequ@@ ent documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , how she loves and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when they saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repeatedly describes the role of the black pregnant women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as sw@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we fight constantly on different fronts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , sul@@ try women must bear the burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Fer@@ rell due to their identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person that stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was at the front , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game .
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the communication activities in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is at the currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway with a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that they call their home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
nevertheless , she gr@@ asp@@ ing himself to a voc@@ als and she feels committed to that memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on into the street three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ line &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a mall in the south @-@ moving pedestrian prec@@ inct since the first presentation 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold lets the subject hardly be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People &apos;s and Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to say to the bit @-@ gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need any human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi b@@ nets ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while pro@@ pon@@ ents refer to the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which also the other stores benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
in addition , the gallery will be exactly planned on the property , on which the peasant market hall is in charge of their products .
with the start of construction work it will be an end .
the gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - at bed@@ a place with possibility to sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost a week in the peasant market for many years .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the owners always very happy .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .
in other cities it is also possible .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether there is a director in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rental .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what shopping bag in Bit@@ burg ?
whether garments , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find the need@@ less .
there are enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops have been empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekend market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will remain .
for all , the goods offered here is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive .
as you can see , store stores in a shopping center only collect from larger companies , because the dor@@ sal are often not viable for a retailer .
too bad , special transactions are almost no more and what is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a mall with a market hall is not suitable for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
in particular : where should the farmers market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will eventually come .
or does it create a bit @-@ bit gallery to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , and no one needs .
in my opinion it would have been better to make a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market riding , it is thanks to the won@@ dro@@ us many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg any place more .
when the peasant hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
an appropriate simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , which hang almost in@@ compar@@ ably equal - the cor@@ ds of the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service analy@@ st was in prison for a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after they publicly plug@@ ged diplomatic reports on the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ b@@ lance ( One simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ cript and ground@@ breaking dis@@ an@@ ed , whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the numerical analysis of DNA which could be extracted from the 30 portraits , as anyone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , although some intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA @-@ data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already since their pu@@ ber@@ ty has been openly discussed about identification as a woman , including six violations of the spi@@ on @-@ law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , sitting in the Mann@@ ing is inten@@ tionally sitting on a horse @-@ seat and a plat@@ inum blonde with which she has been associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was straight from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &quot; stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
it produced in it the artist portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ens@@ ische arti@@ facts like cigarette lighter and chew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make an image of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she was not visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea , and asked her whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ain@@ ted M@@ use were un@@ equal to un@@ equal pen@@ pal , which re@@ mit several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ah Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ pped Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; which would fores@@ aw a future where President Ch@@ aff &apos;s ruling would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release would call for seven brutal years in a military coup in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy con@@ jun@@ ta .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deeper and Star@@ kes , because Donald Tru@@ mp will lead a war against inform@@ ants from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able routes in order to fix the rigid divisions which he actually should fix .
as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg after the strange tim@@ ing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , the artistic statement called for Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis sex , race , sexuality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and GS , and As , in a pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by incorpor@@ ating the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ ti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) to show how amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories .
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the above Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
it shows cre@@ ing , as it appears with a head@@ lamp in the hand of the discipl@@ in@@ arctic of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who s@@ alute from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still come go@@ ose , when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was predic@@ able in the com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ lions , which comp@@ iling themselves as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , with which their genetic har@@ p groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also stuck behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and a leader of the University of Oxford for kill@@ ings looked for
a scenic human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford that was sought as susp@@ ects after a man had been sto@@ cked at a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday we were exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) War@@ rant for murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the courts of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
one of the police authority of Chicago published by the police community of Chicago , that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27th .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained at the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ectiv@@ es examine the engra@@ vings as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ an has been a professor of Micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ an , the Vice President for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ ws are now being rob@@ ber@@ y now and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; this is now a criminal affair pertaining to the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ an .
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an E @-@ Mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and ready to help the US investig@@ ators in every conceivable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a idea of their residence , and our efforts to locate them &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ Building , who had just received a mysterious tip , the said that in apartment 10@@ 08 had happened .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the sacrifice , and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ timetable in the near future , &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the world @-@ anti @-@ Doping Agency ( W@@ ada ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ doping agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) will be implemented .
&quot; at a particular stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Doping ) .
the W@@ ada @-@ plan was updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the roadmap of the W@@ ada to comply with the Code that describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ ated R@@ USA@@ DA and has recently been published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he does not contain anything that could be concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list is , however , that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained from the W@@ ada approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , to publicly accept stat@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport .
in regard to the matter said Mut@@ ko : &quot; we perform the investigation as our anti @-@ doping system collap@@ sed a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ in@@ words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the director of the independent Russian anti @-@ Doping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian Sales Office R@@ Sport to the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brain @-@ Sk@@ and@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the execution of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it has been permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Doping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting the main arti@@ san@@ er of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Direc@@ tor Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli that R@@ USA@@ DA is moving in the right direction , to be used again .

it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ on , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints from staff .
well , as the company Conver@@ tible , problems , the previously made by managers who have been tu@@ cked into offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or non @-@ smar@@ ter trainees are identified and addressed .
&quot; I can move closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree perspective into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders in employment and legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for eth@@ ic violations by the En@@ ron @-@ sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it lasted until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ tible offer your software as a service and charge the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that will support the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Conver@@ tible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which was raised all capital to $ 47 million .
led $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , and brought up its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are barely surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s staff can expect more jobs from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only assignments .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are glad to feel in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Linked@@ In that uses both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten if its portfolio companies are good running . businesses are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise , dedication and the use of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
however , the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company requests employees after your feedback , there may be an expectation that changes on the way .
and if the change comes not fast enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and set up demo@@ ti@@ fs .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen it too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow , people wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have ye really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom do you not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who has now run monthly staff members now , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t so salvation .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry that is known for high resolutions .
&quot; if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customer , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood .
at 23 o &apos;clock it is possible to get a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercises of the team on campus .
some have pulled off their tri@@ c@@ oto@@ parts and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are written for the summer courses are returning to their final test after the three @-@ hour exercise , before returning the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real Tre@@ t@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday became .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and she actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
that is why the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed time schedules to the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood at the beginning of the camp has been postponed for almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time in Mor@@ as six times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they shall hold in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal player preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he under@@ takes the control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a more point to the many busy itineraries of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they just have crossed through , they plac@@ ements , they are great people .
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp ends , what is the clear line of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of an up@@ scale class that has already been ej@@ ected with foot@@ prints , which will be a protective line behind a door@@ pole , no easy task .
Bru@@ e@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far away to think that people rent a room there and then set it to draw up a practice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video ob@@ and from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I do not have too big worry .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts check in the fight against counterf@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterf@@ eit feed@@ backs to the fact tested by third parties and to show their results under the original contribution then , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it is beginning to begin with the use of updated machine methods to detect possible mis@@ messages and to send it to the fact@@ orial audi@@ tor who may display results of the fact@@ inspection from the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the principal points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of which have many believe that it also influences the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were over@@ floo@@ ded in advance of the presidential elections in May , and Germany will support a plan where social media networks are to be pun@@ ished , if they didn &apos;t manage to eliminate all @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to finding that stories of fact @-@ tested parties are challenged , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ ons for fac@@ ebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes in his news feed in order to l@@ essen false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a sip for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ one with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead since 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ ti@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac steering wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;@@ Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thum@@ b @-@ pressure on the side of a letter , which was written by a double ag@@ enten in the 1700 @-@ ans , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his durability !
and letters always smells of smoke , because at that time they become a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself were .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so with old papers is that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have really over@@ rated my welcome , &quot; ) this seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , studying the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena @-@ heads at the walls and the bottles , the centuries in the dit@@ ch had spent .
he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ s@@ love , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank , &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received the full access in 2006 than the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just began to worry about the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ok@@ mar@@ ry said &quot; Oh , wir@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps , which poss@@ essed : &quot; you could mean that country @-@ conflic@@ ting would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke in order to have fought two families .
guys , let everything go their gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a revol@@ t that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; the farmer began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Foundation , hidden the Family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , shown in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was presented from the 18th century by filled his own bur@@ ial , making a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen just seemed to be ga@@ un@@ er , always make debts and spend money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men redeemed their school cr@@ acks by talking rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote compassion . &quot;
after the end of his engagement at the castle is Rhodes in search of other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two weeks stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about El@@ amm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney also has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to be done with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old mari@@ achi bands in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the sle@@ eve of the 3@@ 01 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to launch a new roof ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the slogan to Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August it will be the highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the rh@@ einf@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their yesterday &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make it clear that man@@ ia is better than it seems .
basically , we strongly believe that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer will appreciate the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action it is going to be more than &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ ste@@ al promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able sole notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Honnef can rent its new roof and campaign in Bad Honnef .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year in early August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on retirement ings and carriage in the officer .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was held no longer in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the prime office of the prime minister .
at the deliber@@ ations , under the presidency of the heads of government , the five vice @-@ scep@@ tics as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
thus , civilians were in the Y@@ as in the over@@ number .
the government moves the bre@@ eder on the military .
the General Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ mander of the army , the a@@ erial forces and the Navy were ab@@ rupt .
since the failed cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als were fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of con@@ tra @-@ related connections to the movement of the exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire moving of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who were to have been involved immediately at the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erdo@@ gan was referred to as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan has really under control of the army ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general measure , there are concerns over an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which among others in the lifting of the Head@@ tu@@ ch@@ ban for Sol@@ dat@@ within manifest@@ ing , wrote the newspaper .
the large @-@ pur@@ pos@@ ach@@ ment of the army and the security forces goes on at any rate .
in mid @-@ July the Erdo@@ gan took another 73@@ 95 State serving , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan seemed at the military as I Erdo@@ gan .
the gener@@ als are formerly the actual lords of the country .
three times , they had their appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state of state .
after his election victory , Erdo@@ gan broke the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan , target@@ ing a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particular not called officers &quot; who sought after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extremi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
if this applies , such development could not be put to Nato .
in any case , there are doubts expressed in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational competences are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
he looks to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stri@@ c@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill design should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way the U.S. will be issued by other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economies are getting too good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , cited by the American media .
Ministry plans to return track for racing shuttle
over the past few months , over the future of the race of the race was gone - now it is to be quick to go .
even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ vel distance , on which the tourist railway drives , it will be built .
in order to secure the future of the race of the race , the road will begin on the route according to the dates of the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ ise the route from Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ sti@@ ff , the country is especially important for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated traffic secretary Klaus Sü@@ hl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the maintenance of the circuit is about 2.5 million euros .
by this sum the land take 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country , will currently be voted permanently , stated Sü@@ ver .
the ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ ingen railway as a operator can already agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the roadmap , the used vehicles and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sü@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned treaty between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race @-@ sti@@ ff will be ordered on December 2017 .
the race @-@ car @-@ Shuttle is one of the popular rail links between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ sti@@ g .
during the last months the course of a pilot company was tested , whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order them again in the future .
the route is also in parts strongly b@@ los@@ som@@ ely .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it can not become crazy , a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ P ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ous professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ P , we must begin to take their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of fingers .
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; Mr Shar@@ key said in the release of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ans have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a Sili@@ cone , which feels warm , with consciously human reactions that can be reached by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and in doing so everything , from the eye @-@ color of the robot on the form of fli@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would look like a step@@ pe @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ans have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows for instance to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties which can be appealing as for example sp@@ aci@@ ousness .
and then there is still those of True Comp@@ ani@@ on developed Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sp@@ aci@@ ousness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ ani@@ on .
so , they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has its mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female properties , the play@@ es on rape when one is taking a step in Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , be@@ ating a most .
on his site True Comp@@ ani@@ on Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website .
however these sex @-@ robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
her creation and increasing refinement point to something dark and deep@@ ened in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal for equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course keep no sex robots , and while the FR@@ P notes their growing popularity , they still remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture .
but what penet@@ rates out of the side @-@ zones can be in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting until the free market exists for this purpose .
there is however a certain tri@@ mmer that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world where there is a president in the White House who gr@@ asp@@ ed to have women sexually attacked .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the me@@ tic@@ ated body and the out@@ going eyes , but how realistic this vision affects .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the target behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women so realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or a background history , nothing that indicates the imagination or anything that might dis@@ rupt the fantasy of total submission .
in other words : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as a term of a common sense of man
it has become a bin@@ oc@@ ation of the Tru@@ mp era that political divisions , which have pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. voters , even families in small format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to sel@@ ects relatives in the United States with the horror of Tru@@ mp .
we are all supposedly supposed to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together .
I chose this because my cous@@ ins , a left @-@ oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family who visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which they had fought for decades due to policy , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar on the same side .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks with it .
the left has been strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the con@@ ical impact of his Presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ al@@ ising &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ ati@@ le possibility that we will no longer encounter his mem@@ os of a day .
but there is a still scar@@ ce scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to its standards as a ep@@ it@@ ome of denial .
I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ic version of the publisher - the dog on Auto@@ d@@ ach , the 14 % in@@ comes tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - which both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact tend to be a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tru@@ mp is going , the next candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans will only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in town , we brought our children to car@@ ou@@ sel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ us@@ ell &apos;s New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if one does not need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ red and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate @-@ per@@ ing music convey@@ s it a noticeable fashion .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely different from the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have done the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody was asked about it .
on the other hand , I was obliged to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
at the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tip load - this to buy something over the shop .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no is required .
the poor wife in the department store stood still apologi@@ zed while I tired the experience made her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ ius with chest ache from prison to hospital
Pi@@ stor@@ ius has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of Schn@@ itten on his wr@@ ist , which he suffered the pr@@ isons , according to a fall in his cell .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius was condemned because of murder , a appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first sk@@ ill@@ ary part .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s early morning by giving them several times through a door of the toil@@ et@@ ries in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night &apos;s intru@@ der who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to put this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pi@@ an@@ ius to say , from which they say , be too short @-@ sigh@@ ted .
the national law enforcement authorities said that it will raise an objection in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .
Pi@@ stor@@ ius is at risk that his punishment is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg
as the last of the Flo@@ wer@@ berger schools , the neighborhoods cant@@ onal from Fü@@ tzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and the leading schools .
three of the class@@ y students go to the gram@@ mar school , four to the real school .
school Director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .

Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and sent it out by its chicken .
instead of a chicken ch@@ ick came out a little eagle .
however , the hope to make out of him a chicken , cutting himself , the eagle , spread out his wings on a high mountain in a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .

software update for diesel cars : what the persons concerned must now know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are available for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are supposed to improve the emissions behavior of cars of the emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of ACE Auto Club Europa offers assess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schumann mel@@ software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has arranged the Office of the federal office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a quick implementation in the next few months , but not yet known an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write any person concerned .
if any inspection is due in any consideration , it will be done in their frame .
how long should the equi@@ p@@ ments go altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the curtains depend on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen we voluntarily act the aut@@ oh@@ or@@ ers in the subject of environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long is the update to last ?
the re@@ armament itself could last three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ up could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE v@@ elled to wait .
pres@@ um@@ ably foreign manufacturers would go , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
now threat@@ ens a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE was afraid .
but even in the regions where the bot@@ e thre@@ aten .
in the rural area there are so far no value loss for the older diesel .
the ACE v@@ elled , with a sale still to be seen .

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues next year in R@@ ente .
the spot is already written - suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
since 31 years W@@ acker is Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he convey@@ s in the press conference .
he reports of varying , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for His followers .
at the same time , mir@@ ac@@ ulate that so far no application will fulfil the requirement profile .
the city is searching for an architect or building engineer at the time of the next time .
in this way - in consideration of the regular cancellation period - there is enough time for an introduction .
since Has@@ lach for the administrative community acts as an under@@ mine building rights , the applicant must pre@@ dict@@ ate the correspon@@ dents .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they can no longer fill it , the citizens would have to leave for advice up to Offen@@ burg .
but the proximity to the town and itself is important to him , says W@@ acker that reports from a good working atmosphere as well as good mood between the authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered to look back on the w@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is safe over the Office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ y park .
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Bol@@ len@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium is still the subject .
the latter alone will take about 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; If we make it right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything in all wait great tasks on my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
aged is present for a Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker of great room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ den@@ ser , it can react quite flexibly to multiple times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the Green Are@@ as will be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old city stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for that which adap@@ ts , &quot; when new builds are approved , empha@@ sizes the separ@@ ating city @-@ farmer .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ aker bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; at the end everything runs here on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of support and co @-@ ordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ tic@@ ulture ) has been the company for ten years now , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ tic@@ ulture ) has been for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains for a long time , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we look for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should be completed after information of the city of Has@@ lach a completed study as a Diplom@@ atic or Bachelor with specialist architecture and have a good expertise in the areas of construction and construction projects .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stand high and deep @-@ building , construction planning , dit@@ worth@@ iness , administration of urban properties , municipal courts with bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ gar@@ ner@@ ei , as well as subordin@@ ate construction rights , including monument protection .
bicycles on the lines : the south @-@ route locked
according to police previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so heavily damaged , that the her@@ ding freight train had to be kept .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetrators and look for them since the night @-@ hour .
near the scene have been observed by witnesses a pink Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike @-@ driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond an Laus@@ anno@@ y@@ coup , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators and the perpetrators have brought themselves into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the rail traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the lo@@ k and the plant as well as the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport , even P@@ ön@@ alen customers could go to the offen@@ ders .
overall , let go out of a &quot; significant &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ lane could be managed without disabilities .
nearly 10 persons of persons were fallen on Friday afternoon , two of which are concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres of upper pi@@ pel@@ ines .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammat@@ ory intest@@ ine )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ amed bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amping and fl@@ aps , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected will normally get to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found researchers at the Washingtoner Universität found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins found to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the guiding researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine patented to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food not penetrate into the body .
cells , which are capable of infl@@ ated inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue .
if balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result from a inflammat@@ ory intest@@ ine .
in experiments has been determined that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium pre@@ aches Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the builders of proteins to solve the appearance of cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial infection - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food had , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one at Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less inflammat@@ ory intestinal mi@@ tig@@ us , if the same system is also used for people .
the post@@ doctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immun@@ ological cells that had the tolerance when she found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but had not been separated .
they suspected that the difference had to deal with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the dy@@ es of the mice have been DNA sequ@@ entially and it were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them were lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ il@@ ant environment so that they did not develop a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells , and they were produced by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers suggest L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immun@@ o@@ cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous were hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ auxiliary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i developed the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in G@@ enen in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammat@@ ory intestinal diseases .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote because these cells have inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ology can result in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening his debut against Samp@@ it had .
the 40 million pounds of the Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last Pre @-@ Season game , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the H@@ old role , as people like Paul Sz@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to Pop@@ ular .
MA@@ TIC was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before starting the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic we also started Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes three further new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; has made three of his four priority re@@ agents .
&quot; three of four to get , thank you to the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got for me four of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the US @-@ plane manufacturer Boeing has the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky painted .
the pil@@ ots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , the drawing began but in Mar@@ qu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , these are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the shape of a Dream@@ robot was to be the shape of a Dream@@ robot .
the whole was a di@@ gest for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new C@@ lement for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
how the wind is turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still a SPD Chief , it looked at the democratic prime minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin .
just no interference from the party central , only no counter@@ wind out of the covenant - this was the most important desire of the elec@@ tive fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the Party , the fundamentally changed .
since then , he has been watching the associates from the Willy Brandt @-@ Haus with grown @-@ up the events in the SPD ruling country capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach at the approach .
there were deep attacks .
and that one after the other .
the CD@@ U @-@ CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Nieder@@ s@@ achsen a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not over@@ flow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising question of a Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ens &apos; has led the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the term of the term , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes @-@ majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Bundes@@ business@@ man Michael Kellner has prompted the desc@@ end@@ age of the Gre@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ essa called to return its mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ AM must immediately return to its mandate , &quot; said the Bundes@@ bank leader and election campaign on the Green Business Network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should all be not true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ s an SPD election , as on Friday morning , the new hi@@ ring message reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister von Nieder@@ s@@ achsen , is after the trans@@ gression of the green members of El@@ ke T@@ ets on the CD@@ U without our own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades @-@ time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was then also true - and it was all distin@@ ctly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute @-@ bank@@ rupt .
in the weeks the comrades lined up again in the weeks after it .
then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next cr@@ unch came .
Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the final strong SPD state , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication so quite everything was wrong , what you can do wrong .
ever since it is fighting for its political survival .
so now Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW exhau@@ st gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Prime Minister has been in criticism for a longer time .
mi@@ ese ren@@ ces were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps exactly why , W@@ eil tried to bet more and more strongly in the last weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin also remained hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , since they talked about a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
in doing so , W@@ eil meets the cross @-@ party internal constraints is basically no fault .
and Schulz certainly not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes the comrades try to keep the ranks of his own ranks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the desc@@ end of the female parliam@@ ent@@ arians .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs T@@ essa takes their own care@@ ers about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party of Party in the SPD faction , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ essa is not elected because of their personality as a direct can@@ did@@ atin , but on the Landes@@ bank of the Lower Green Party , so the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische MP continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary group , lam@@ ents a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil as prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leading the Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische SPD as excell@@ ency in the German Bundestag , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career calls for a future CD@@ U MEPs call the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ah@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he urged to clarify the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further ple@@ dges of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ s@@ achsen .
funding Center for Regional Development
who wants to be re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated in the years can soon get support from the country .
informed about this informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in received .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a glimpse of the previous one .
since 1991 it has been carrying in delicate refur@@ bish@@ ment areas .
back then , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding prize .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allow@@ ance was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development and not only to tap into new areas of building .
on April 4th you will receive the information of the Council of Governance in Karlsruhe that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the total amount of 8@@ 33 333 Euros , of which sp@@ illed 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community received .
how does a refur@@ bish@@ ment area come from ?
one will continue to examine so sc@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also plays a role whether there is an interest in the planned region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if necessary , the regional borders could then be displ@@ aced again .
the stroke represented on Mit@@ tw@@ och Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the content of the federal @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out .
core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of domestic cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .
the measures would object @-@ related , which is called per plot .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would then eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the authorization period for the funding exp@@ ires since 1 January 2017 until 30 . April 20@@ 26 .
even until September of this year , however , this year I would once again take stock , within the framework of which those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area will get a questionnaire to filling out a questionnaire .
in November or December the pro@@ filing system should be made , so that in the coming year the renov@@ ations can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Commun@@ e must carry out the said demonstrations .
it is a question of jud@@ ging the urban planning of affairs , and decide when a san@@ itar@@ ist will be evaluated and to what extent .
there is then also a refur@@ bish@@ ment in the basic text@@ book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again and get a picture of the situation she said .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
that is why the questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property &quot; in which it concerns the constru@@ cting state and the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; can provide information on size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farm bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only possible if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , though , Got@@ zel definitely pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .
additionally , new construction measures are not beneficial .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; wind &quot; prin@@ cipl@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes , gr@@ ates first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t want to book support for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to completion , still photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local News II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tic invent@@ ors is composed by himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a microphone , so that he can open its door@@ step , enter his office and even start with a to@@ wel movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , joined to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the Cast@@ les of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .

the advertising cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands of thousands of real estate ads
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ al helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that lifts American manufacturing over the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the specifications of the military that have been left to TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board was the heart of the event on 17th July in the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over 50 countries .
the helicopter @-@ helicopter was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississippi .
the Military Office of the White House slow@@ ed down the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ ge S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 at the eve of the event its super@@ visor , the dep@@ uty Mar@@ ine@@ com@@ mander for aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 July at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and until the lawn remained vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the hours a second team would require for the return flight .
the original flight was during the event with the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the period .
out of the records provided by the TI@@ ME was not clear if ultimately a second plane was required .
the H@@ atch Act negoti@@ ates states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the purpose .
&quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the com@@ mander .
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; answered the dep@@ uty com@@ mander .
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he pro@@ pa@@ ve the efforts to demon@@ v@@ ature of government regulations .
the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
Presidents are required to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation in February when the Presidential aircraft before the background of his first camp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of noti@@ fications that compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; the dep@@ uty leader of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to reset the US President in the White House with conc@@ ise zen@@ ith .
as a Tru@@ mp early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced in the White House of 58 exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was given by the training requirement for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ chan@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers have no burden for none of the other re@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget design@@ ations for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the US Defence Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ rep@@ atri@@ ation of the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
records of unity notice the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the hom@@ eb@@ ase of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for re@@ funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a margin from 2015 , the income rates for DO@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract charges .
at that time the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ect@@ are , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present these weekly things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ents .
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I go from that hundreds if not even thousands of people are dependent on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate , that is worthy of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp is inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and numbered with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team which always plays a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how always hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV

even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US cl@@ ash .
after all , the draft was looking forward to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians build pi@@ pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU .
since then , investors from local O@@ MV have been fully funded with other European companies , which co @-@ financed by other European firms in the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea coast .
the dru@@ mm@@ ation is violent .
nevertheless , it is too early for a estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of oil business .

the rel@@ ays three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the newest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ t the show .

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen@@ ware
the city organ@@ ises the K@@ ita @-@ Mittag@@ stock again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city centre , the watch is turned back .
to September 1st , the city of Kre@@ feld is taking over the food supply in the city of day@@ care centres ( kitesur@@ f ) again in equity .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , acting director in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
cooked except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh @-@ cooked cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the circular fields of 46 kinder@@ gartens , in 44 the children get a hot meal at noon .
in the past year , there were 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 weekend hours are taken care of , in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children remain until 14 am . &quot;
46 part @-@ time resources are starting from 1st September kitchen service : they heat the landscaped dishes , supplement it to salad , raw materials and fruits , por@@ ters the meal individual , give the food out , wash@@ es , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are inci@@ dents , as well as sev@@ enty @-@ class facilities - decide on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team would be reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , one person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity was important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - is done in future by special det@@ erg@@ ents .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power also the charm you have in cost @-@ equal between self @-@ reg@@ ain and foreign @-@ disclosure to the city as the most economical ones , it is called from the Press Office .
and that , even though 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ employed .
&quot; but these hours falling for some 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans not so strong into the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all the members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , Chairman of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are can@@ op@@ ted by the R@@ ats@@ elections in the provinces . three women run for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .

GM@@ B concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
one trade union would like to know at managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said , the company had to weigh on the future of investment at the Tol@@ l@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which beside other products are hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years .
he added that employees and trade union officials would be experienced as the first if their activities would change .
in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ ites of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns that the financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tol@@ l@@ cross , concerns our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the labor force concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Region , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production coin in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person of Pla@@ i said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ites at Tol@@ l@@ cross has only received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to that , as we appreciate the continuous commitment with employees and trade union officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B representatives at Tol@@ l@@ cross in which some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we discussed with the staff that we operate as all companies , which are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , our business are constantly checked and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tol@@ l@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of Tol@@ l@@ cross as production facilities fully and at all . should change our operational processes at the site , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago in front of N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League will be able to rep@@ ent their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having given an offer of £ 189 million in order to det@@ ach its free@@ wheel clause , but did they warned about three years before the world attack ?
the sensational approach is heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ club is ready to break the world record to break more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Sz@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pound to Manchester United returned .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out there , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans pres@@ Board insi@@ sts that the club has always been his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 , interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each association , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I am not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer , interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ feld@@ player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report dis@@ reli@@ eved e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report on the abuse of abuse is Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after publication across the German press agency , he expect from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger Bishop and today &apos;s Card@@ inal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year Bro@@ ther brother of the em@@ eri@@ zed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an excuse .
it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their at that time false evaluation of their processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence among the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two @-@ level measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the attack in Regensburg , no one knows that it had to be prevented by &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions , &quot; but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; as the author &quot; Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , histor@@ i@@ ker@@ in and Member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit , which design@@ ate the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep the normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in the Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you would like to go on the church and that is a long @-@ round fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore she pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with friends , as I was one was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair , current standards apply to past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , often also Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and histor@@ ian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the souvenir band &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says H@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was submitted by the Bi@@ st@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plur@@ ality &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be understood that from Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high quality emo@@ tionally , the punishment of the students could also be inten@@ sely affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accus@@ ations that many victims were killed by R. R. and so in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , H@@ emann &apos;s report explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thinks his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Pre@@ vention of Non @-@ Viol@@ ence of Non @-@ Ma@@ zur@@ es with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students stand out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
for the other he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , who was in@@ comprehensible by the econom@@ ist , if a domain set has no top performance .
how do you evaluate as your bio@@ grapher this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all .
he has just been devoted eight sides once and it is clearly imp@@ aired by any suspici@@ on of the medi@@ ator or co @-@ workers with the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its effectiveness .
you may susp@@ end it at all , to experience it too late or have the first hint not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ inal School , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the wide majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes an excellent witness , described him as &quot; warm , &quot; sincerely , &quot; prof@@ icient &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who made the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bondage and &apos; always provided by grapes of children .
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tionist and its high sti@@ p@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages .
that he kn@@ itted not only with chairs , and cast the key@@ word on the ground , but also ear@@ nest@@ y boys in the hair or ears , he has given himself since years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for them .
to his honor of honor , however , must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and se@@ ven@@ ties , by parents such as teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
naturally , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state Gymnasium .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school , the ad@@ mitt@@ edly dre@@ ad@@ y@@ man .
one already asks herself if it is not likely with his famili@@ arity and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , too , that many media had just st@@ ashed around him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood it , still eag@@ erly wanting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the truth is : the report of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media the news has been reported much about the issue of misuse with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also placed some distor@@ tion or co @-@ workers with regard to sexual abuse at last ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual persu@@ asion claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never d@@ anced to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; said a subject of sufferers for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing to me . &quot;
the true problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers rate a role in terms of abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a respon@@ dent student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case , in which he could have had timely knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective perpetrators .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to suppose that it is expected to have an intru@@ der or more clearly defined as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ guides , confidence instru@@ ctors etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it could not be confirmed in the run @-@ run student and / or their environment in advance , could not be confirmed as part of the examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as regards sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from any co @-@ author .
thus it cannot be thrown into him , not to be prevented or brought to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradi@@ ct@@ ory crimes , as it is unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is dis@@ car@@ ded in the report .
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and distor@@ ted to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
then there will be clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other accus@@ ations .
moreover , the report covers pre @-@ inci@@ dents in the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole terrible testing pedago@@ gy , the cases where the l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ sti@@ cally instru@@ ctors have been sho@@ cked and mal@@ ign@@ ant , all occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to have left .
but with whom had nothing to do with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the young only to face when she had already been on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ina .
in what was the most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ inal School ?
Michael Hes@@ emann has been a discipline , but there was no dictatorship of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims led the general humanity from R. R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even combine positive memories with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so at most still the accus@@ ation has to be shel@@ tered .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which he was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish itself and was not responsible for the events in a school , where he didn &apos;t want to hear and responsible ( such a witness ) nothing , and then again to 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently puts the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ änge , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points to that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in pre @-@ school the audi@@ tors will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the light of the risk of neg@@ ative press , he recommended an urgent one @-@ step forward .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as a certificate was also banned in Bavaria too long .
before that she occurred in a legal gray area , as each one of us is still white .
there was difficult to estimate for him , where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permissible border has been exceeded .
but it is not possible to say , he could have always been cur@@ sed .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 the test was officially established in Bavaria at the same time in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis asser@@ ted that it is unfair , to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards on the then time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger , past and present moral standards .
there the prin@@ cess has been right .
but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ om@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of res@@ ili@@ ence and violence at un@@ school children , which goes far beyond that time evil .
that &apos;s all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ nest@@ ly and to pull her hair and ears , were widely spread in the 1970s .
as physical continu@@ ance then it was forbidden , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
what image of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Time has played Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in conversation with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ?
did the issue of the test came to the language too ?
Michael Hes@@ man : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , &quot; tells of his perspective , there the cathedral @-@ cats played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I am not at all by no means that he introduced a stri@@ c@@ ter reg@@ iment .
but even this must be said once again : without this perfec@@ tionist , without which we demand un@@ condi@@ tional discipline , it would be hardly possible for him to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went their tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ ons alone , one does not make any big singers and stand before every success equal to which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
and what kind of man did you experience George R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ man : through working on the book and in addition , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really very well and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , pri@@ me@@ able , deep believing and heart@@ felt good people from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could not only do some fly .
I regularly come with , like many former cathedral @-@ cats still today , 23 years after its empowerment , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him today that he was strictly speaking to them , therefore they are clearly in the minority .
most of them are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he always was a good , fa@@ ther@@ less teacher - a stri@@ c@@ ter father , certainly that may be - but also a ador@@ able respect for the person was to look at them today and to honour them .
and please , once again clearly , all that one casts to him are gu@@ ardi@@ ans that were at that time on the order of the day .
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because it is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin @-@ goat .
there is the evil intention that is behind it , just too obvious .
because the report that was just published , reli@@ eved him .
now the an@@ standing areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired huge earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( finally found in peace ) .
