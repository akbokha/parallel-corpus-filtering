<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards, which change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt where young people are to be met today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A greeting chapel, where now is buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-gardeners spend the rest of the peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when landcards are not currently up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had to be exciting already times because the Auto-Navi took place of a turn-road a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are anything but up to date - but that is why very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a makescreen that can be seen as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big picture postcard for towns and communities became more detailed cards, so-called Urpositional leaflets.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was produced according to the Bayerische Vermessaging administration between 1810 and 1864 and derive from the first Vermessung Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition-war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerunes - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops were finally deported to the peace of Lunéville, 9 February 1801, the present neighbours were created by the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph moved forward the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Vermessaging administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urposure leaflet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the other on the website of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling which appears in the map of 1856 yet relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today he is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the houses are concentrated in 1856 along the Plinganserroad that was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: with dozens of dozens of lines and numbers: hand numbered copies from the so-called "Urintake," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots occupy no farmers there today - but small gardener of the plant" "" "land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 swings of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urposure leaflet, one reads in the territory of the present district au-Haidhausen not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse you can once set people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt" "" "At the Auer Lufting," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard from Gudden, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment of the psychiatrists in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the bet of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">He has forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Director of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later on 500 places has been extended.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">There has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the top of the former Auer Anstalt now people are meeting in Münchner Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order had the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 the children-house "Casa Don Bosco" was created in an architecturistic approach to the origin of the Irrenprison, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was in 1856 as" main square "" "," the Kaufingerstraße was called "" "" Kaufinger alley. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="45">A crucial change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a salad chapel from the Middle Ages had once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the spade for the second S-railway line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizenship group published travel report for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the Promotion of Brown has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which will come into force by 28 August 2017, calls for Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missoulans, while travelling through the state will have special attention and be noticed, as a series of fragmentary, rally-based accusation occurred recently in the entire State and stated here," said it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult to win disdiscrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to extract the tour warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted because of their skin colour, they are put together or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group quoted incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in late circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no gasoline any more during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent report by the office of the general state-old of Missouri, shown in which black car drivers in the state 75 percent are more common than whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and informed their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri was posted in 2015 100 years, according to the latest figures from the wake-up-out reporting program of the FBI, which straps the state with respect to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The tour warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) were issued for Texas and Arizona, after the States immigration laws passed, the local prosecution authorities undertake to withstand people because of immigration and to contribute to further rapproving the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel notifications are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have set the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The deceased project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weideconjn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the vgrabenhof of the family Schwendemann the representative of the fishing bacher CDU office together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann afforded insights into its operation, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows and as well as many young animals provided and in five apartments holiday guests accommodated.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black-milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketer route for the milk of his cows, so pivore." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as it is also the BLHV-president of fishing bach, he declared the" "" "elementary project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot work profitably on such a steep surface.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for a lot of work, much should be edited with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the terms and conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterly farm and built these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even though he does not lead to biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the" "" "deception project" "" "and is happy about the leader of the leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">The farmers have to support farmers at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">They hope that the afforestation of the areas could be moved out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and do thoughts as they continue their operation," "" "said Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism due to the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the ordination of deceasant funding were fenced in 2013 a total of 25 plots from eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is approximately 40 hectares that are not allowed to be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the overall cost of the overall cost of 71 500 euros the half of the leader was promoted, a quarter carried by the township of fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "thus, the farmers faded 12 610 euro, which had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of course." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, with no farmers and farmers."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White stood firm," "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landsalogid (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the opening of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Pre-requisite is the presence of one of the lungs marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "in addition, the fence-based surface must not be inconceivable (Hanging above 35 percent) and must be threatened by reforestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fishing bacher Weighost project, 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build nearly 16 kilometers of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The surface area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the painstakingly staged overthrow of Saddam Hussan on the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic aspiration in a heated argument with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President on the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde by boat owners and Liberty Shiitators would have suffered it when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he laid hold of their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta," "" "I don't want to enter into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to it was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is knowledgeable right, but as he formulated it itself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the ascending words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only load any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your exhausted, thy poor, / thy afflicted masses who desire to breathe free, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elding waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who put themselves into place their words after their death on the base - did very good that they did a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism, in which it presented the feminine embodiment of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she himself gives himself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people wanted to change from the right wing this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big screwas rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is not unlock, but rather an early neo-conservative that the American flame goes into the persecuted world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something pushed.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative effect of Lazarus was to see them as they did from the exhausted, miserable, but hopful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships was seen.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must listen.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black loaves Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two chotters belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The power director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member contingent of the World Championship team will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue to go until we figure it out," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals Anwärter, including Laura Muir and Andrew Buttes - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m distance, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the crew for the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were cheottic or wherever they live or train, went out of space and were very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie was naturally lit, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-Silver medal, which is played at its fifth World Championships in the 400-m Hürden, says that it's "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-stretching muir leads on this path and last year five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another grotto that one should be observed after a great season which included the victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">She was reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Sotto in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team but in some cases also with the medals and at the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be in this team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway great honor to know, but to know that my team-mate has voted for me and chose to do something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the carrots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb onto Podia.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to set on this homesupport and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I'll get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: Have you not to enter a public office if you cannot wear the injecting of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something from poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers proposed him because of all, from the internal policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He pushes in criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on it, more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil liberties grieve him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Stab of the governor, left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Na, and?"</seg>

<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debating his haired head after chemotherapy on his site.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees who will be paid with public tax-Dollars - needless and finally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Specherin Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolley or spammers or water-filled people who swing online the whip.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche is invited to the old cemetery Areal in tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July at 16.30 pm at a Serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historical St. Hilarius system a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors involved in their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique local treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In the year 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle has been mentioned for the first time in the ministry's Urtbook: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the judgment on the tumour mountain stood on the Tumlinger Berg but also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the church or the patron saint and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the Oberamorphan Freudenstadt from 1858, was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today is still visible in the picture of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settler of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 underpin these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The Patronatsright was born out of the earliest medieval equity law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord, who built a church, taken out and occupied with a pastor, continues to be in the owner of this church, and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars were found in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The biggest of the two smash to Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell then screened for the first time in 1692, but later was released in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undensely.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops in the vicinity of the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and churpers and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threaten 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger-Cemetery served as the last resting-place for the dead from Earschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche stopped.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the cherry tower had been left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year eight 1834, a storm started the cherry storm and half of it crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent an unhappiness, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kmarberger and Rolf-Dieter Washer have been a successor of Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organiser, the friends and sponsors invite the friends and sponsors on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery at St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>

<seg id="1128">Associations must apply for the purchase of players a lot of money, but need to deal with legitimate essays that allow them to steak the break-up point in their own football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was conceived by Michel Platini in his election as a UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their pursuit of success, effectively frauds and riskizes to ruin if banks or owners have moved their support back.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then vigorated vigorated to improve the team and to build a global brand - to be a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year period of FFP expirate period that will run until 2018, clubs can take loss of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in Ungnade, his UEFA follower Aleksander Ceferin continues to terrify a excessive amount of expenses.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out-clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the solvent claims for the next five years can be reported in the amount of €44.4 million in financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received an imprisonment of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players remaining.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs which might try to overtake their financial account by placing their income by enterprises that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could be sponges the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate insignia.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was held by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar over payments of the Organizing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar could come to Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar World Ambassador will be left and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators will be simple to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The past sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive each attempt to heed the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, sayest on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They said under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since it was not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring Deals, merchandising and trikotbonding.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association is assuming that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers to see, and tried to prevent Neymars displaced by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>

<seg id="1324">Since the first visit the 1,000 square kilometers has been fully overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a televous layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jovial storage space and a mezzanine to best use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for yodels.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms superseded so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine, in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative, in order to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "explains it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked up over each other, without having to leave us." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about creating a simple platform, but to attach the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place Erfan, two rooms full of height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic clutch window looks down by Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The gold-powered gold furniture, silberne aczente and vintage Serge Mouille illumination put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">In both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to take him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we mirrored units for all cutters and glasses of yoanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the living room can exclude the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went there," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, furnified MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is extremely important so that when you shift the door, very easy to slide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and a improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the footprint - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area and to use at the same time quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't forget to put yourself into the electric sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and elevated square meteages of something default in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, it will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the new Stabat of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an equaled course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Stabat of the White House, at his first working day, he received a major problem in President Donald Trumps of White House, which he was repaired: poor information coming into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to enumerate Trump by supervising its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television dates back decades - and now where he is in the White House, his TV advertisement is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was annoyed because of a fair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of places that were persuasive," said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote in time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter-habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials in it, ensuring that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter would ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign bears something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets would have any more ignition included without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the tweet, the Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff has succeeded in keeping it away several times, anger of it, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prohibit it that Trump calls forth controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by promoting Trump materials that may possibly promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - completely occupied with this history - reported in May about the preference of advisors, the President for strategic reasons to make dubious information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press releases, above all such with damaged leaks, and that he will figure out to find out where these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February, when someone gave the President malicious a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocation, Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy rod in Katie whale ssh, "the source behind a pile to be of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banned from Twitter for a long time or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has uttered false accusations in the past and revoke it withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Stabat Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his advisers still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1534">Moreover, the ice plate stand under voltage and could disintegrate if at a keynote a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg increases the level of sea, since they swim in the water and get ice so much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the fracture is that the glacier can flow directly into the sea before and much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only in low measure, writes the British research project to the observation of the Antarctica (MIDAS).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is after AWI-indications of almost 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth largest Schelfeis of Antarctica.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the agrarian Institute of CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender del in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the impact of climate change during the last few years and much more in the fall.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riogorce usually meet in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Zaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office which were in 2009 the goal of an attack with granite, or they let them go home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Safety experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abs.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug control, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no glory of violence, and during all the land the corpses were common, there are more and more journalists coming here: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and their inspirer of Riogorce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and being a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence is felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing its middle-finger with the word "Justice" on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, carrying T-shirts, who show his smiles face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 a Sonder-BundesanBar was established in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only has introduced two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with the most thousands of murder, which are associated every year with drug stores and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are only rare in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riogorce they still insist that the violence of sinaloa is to treat, although it is unknown, and even though the terrain is now more oblique.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know the reason, we distrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15th Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The scorer went out in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans Versions last year and the delivery into the United States in January, Zaloa has become one of the most bloody battleground of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of exposed, two-story mouse-mice for drug royal, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riogorce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, there was the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cartography in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected of the members bought each specimen of the issue as soon as they were shipped to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was in fact not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to his own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez has been a legend of Mexico and abroad, and its killings is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues survived that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was active as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riogorce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism, without referring to the dowry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">In time the newspaper served as a call for the courageous and honest coverage, and the sales and advertising took place.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporter loved it, hard and excited studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories, which no one could deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the creation of Riogorce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" "" "for their coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever they go.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the spa-bird, who was like a harbour worker, the friend, who was generously with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and there always sit on the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now she ask: was his love for routine his corruption?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also compelled them to ask their own assumptions in question how they do the best to do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret runway, and runways to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If there was wrong, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres is Villarreal that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa not more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riogorce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before became known that Spyware sold, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>

<seg id="1872">They were tasked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riogorce in a four-story building in a mid-range area of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporter asked whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who declared the governor themselves as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug makers are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has in three main stories.</seg>

<seg id="1935">"if you are just a little bit flashing with eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature has to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the science story as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this crop-vores, although it is covered with a armor and a changing shell, most likely of meat-eating dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators, and used a paragliding technology, which is used as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to turn its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studied the wild beast and it called Borealopelta markers marked by the Museummerist Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen, made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and form of shed and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defence method in animal-rich, meaning that the head of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the concreditations is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living in today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by having enough pressure due to meat-profit dinosaurs that evolution has beneficiaries the confrontation as a means of survival beneficiary.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contempory animals that use the counter-shaded - are much smaller and hurting than loot, which signaled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivortier behaviour on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have been to have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was red.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on clues about his life, including his concave officer, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs when he died, went into a river and sank into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta were as warm as the southorida today, and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology will appear, believe that Borealopelta has failed after death in the sea and was buried in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near to Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, Gmine.</seg>

<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and halves to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape in Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed totally after the 9th August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met for an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to only "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came Ferrell into the mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2068">Inconsequent documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, how she loves and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and the dehumanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeatedly describes the role of the black pregnant women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as swul.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While proponents refer to the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which also the other stores benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precinct.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be exactly planned on the property, on which the peasant market hall is in charge of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work it will be an end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - at beda place with possibility to sitting outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops have been empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a decent weekend market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will remain.</seg>
<seg id="2111">For all, the goods offered here is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, store stores in a shopping center only collect from larger companies, because the dorsal are often not viable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special transactions are almost no more and what is still left, will probably also disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall is not suitable for me.</seg>

<seg id="2116">In particular: where should the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery will eventually come.</seg>

<seg id="2123">When the peasant hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">An appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits featuring Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, which hang almost incomparably equal - the cords of the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service analyst was in prison for a 35-year prison sentence, after they publicly plugged diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (One similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transcript and groundbreaking disaned, whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the numerical analysis of DNA which could be extracted from the 30 portraits, as anyone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, although some intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA-data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already since their puberty has been openly discussed about identification as a woman, including six violations of the spion-law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a granular, black-white selfie, sitting in the Manning is intentionally sitting on a horse-seat and a platinum blonde with which she has been associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was straight from the great success of their 2012-project "stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced in it the artist portraits of strangers from forensische artifacts like cigarette lighter and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make an image of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she was not visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea, and asked her whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detainted Muse were unequal to unequal penpal, which remit several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoah Kanungo Illustripped Comic "Suppressed Images," which would foresaw a future where President Chaff's ruling would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released, Manning release would call for seven brutal years in a military coup in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy conjunta.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a bit deeper and Starkes, because Donald Trump will lead a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable routes in order to fix the rigid divisions which he actually should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">As Dewey-Hagborg after the strange timing of all these things was asked, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, the artistic statement called for Manning with its oversized signature among them (the "i" in their surname is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis sex, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and GS, and As, in a pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by incorporating the 200 letters (or Nukleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) to show how amazing, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the above Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows creing, as it appears with a headlamp in the hand of the disciplinarctic of the United States such as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they put your speech, then they have won," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "thus, never stop the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "I still come goose, when I talk about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was predicable in the comicbook - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simullions, which compiling themselves as hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also purposeful how everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), with which their genetic harp groups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which also stuck behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not become crazy, a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRP) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emerious professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRP, we must begin to take their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," Mr Sharkey said in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuans have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a Silicone, which feels warm, with consciously human reactions that can be reached by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his beliefs, "and in doing so everything, from the eye-color of the robot on the form of flipples to the type or color of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still disturbing, as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "", "which would look like a steppe-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuans have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for instance to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties which can be appealing as for example spaciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still those of True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of spaciousness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So, they like what you like, and they don't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has its moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female properties, the playes on rape when one is taking a step in Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, beating a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is called on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However these sex-robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Her creation and increasing refinement point to something dark and deepened in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal for equality of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course keep no sex robots, and while the FRP notes their growing popularity, they still remain temporary on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what penetrates out of the side-zones can be in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market exists for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain trimmer that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world where there is a president in the White House who grasped to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the meticated body and the outgoing eyes, but how realistic this vision affects.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The target behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women so realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point when it comes to their "personalities" the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background history, nothing that indicates the imagination or anything that might disrupt the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as a term of a common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binocation of the Trump era that political divisions, which have polarized the U.S. voters, even families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntedankfest there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to selects relatives in the United States with the horror of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly supposed to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousins, a left-oriented poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family who visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House is everyone who knows them, including the Republican relationship, with which they had fought for decades due to policy, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks with it.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the conical impact of his Presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalising" and Trump, we refer to the gratile possibility that we will no longer encounter his memos of a day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is a still scarce scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the right wing, "normalized," which suddenly appeared in comparison to its standards as a epitome of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's uric version of the publisher - the dog on Autodach, the 14% incomes tax (but at least we knew how his tax return saw) - which both compared to Trump in fact tend to be a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans will only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karusell's New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if one does not need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurred and the animals are twisting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate-pering music conveys it a noticeable fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Twenty-five years later, and I am still not entirely different from the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the theme-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two years old, a 11-year old and two women can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have done the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody was asked about it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was obliged to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to buy the rating with a 15% tip load - this to buy something over the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor wife in the department store stood still apologized while I tired the experience made her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest ache from prison to hospital</seg>

<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of Schnitten on his wrist, which he suffered the prisons, according to a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was condemned because of murder, a appeal of the prosecutors against a first skillary part.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's early morning by giving them several times through a door of the toiletries in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night's intruder who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to put this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pianius to say, from which they say, be too short-sighted.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The national law enforcement authorities said that it will raise an objection in the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his punishment is increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory intestine)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflamed bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000, causes stomach cramping and flaps, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected will normally get to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found researchers at the Washingtoner Universität found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins found to develop immune cells, which promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The guiding researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patented to make sure that harmful microbes that hide in the food not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of inflated inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result from a inflammatory intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments has been determined that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium preaches Tryptophan - one of the builders of proteins to solve the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial infection - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one at Tryptophan rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal mitigus, if the same system is also used for people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral degree in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immunological cells that had the tolerance when she found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to deal with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The dyes of the mice have been DNA sequentially and it were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells but without them were lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterilant environment so that they did not develop a intestinal microbiome and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells, and they were produced by L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers suggest L. reuteri in a liquid and overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immunocells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophanous were halved, the number of cells declined by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan-auxiliary products from L. reuteri developed the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in Genen in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote because these cells have inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptopology can result in the presence of L. reuteri to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2866">The sensational approach is heated in the summer, because the Ligue 1-club is ready to break the world record to break more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Szba in the past season for 89 million pound to Manchester United returned.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect?</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report disrelieved e-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-report on the abuse of abuse is Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abscandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are church," stated after publication across the German press agency, he expect from the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year Brother brother of the emerized Pope Benedict XVI, an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church, when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their at that time false evaluation of their processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "however criticized that in reporting on violence among the cathedral-cats with" "" "two-level measure" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attack in Regensburg, no one knows that it had to be prevented by "shameful and shameful actions," but the "degree of medial manipulation," says the "degree of medial manipulation," as the author "Lucetta Scaraffia, historikerin and Member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit, which designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep the normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also in the Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "you would like to go on the church and that is a long-round fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "furthermore she pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows a quite normal pedagogical means" "", "to be done with friends, as I was one was finished." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair, current standards apply to past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, often also Pope Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the souvenir band "My brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take protection from Georg Ratzinger," says Hemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which was submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (" "" "s)" "" "with high plurality" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be understood that from Domkapellmeister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high quality emotionally, the punishment of the students could also be intensely affected.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, unlike many other accusations that many victims were killed by R. R. and so in numerous cases despite violence even positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hemann's report explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger thinks his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Prevention of Non-Violence of Non-Mazures with the Regensburger Domspatzen" is a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students stand out his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who was incomprehensible by the economist, if a domain set has no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as your biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted eight sides once and it is clearly impaired by any suspicion of the mediator or co-workers with the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the non-violence at the pre-school occurred outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You may suspend it at all, to experience it too late or have the first hint not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Domspatzenginal School, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the wide majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also describes an excellent witness, described him as "warm," sincerely, "proficient" and "understandably," as an extremely good-natured teacher, who made the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bondage and 'always provided by grapes of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionist and its high stipality, which also led to Wutausages.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he knitted not only with chairs, and cast the keyword on the ground, but also earnesty boys in the hair or ears, he has given himself since years ago, deeply regrets and excused for them.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor of honor, however, must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and seventies, by parents such as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Naturally, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the placeable sexual abuse and the non-violence at the pre-school, the admittedly dreadyman.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One already asks herself if it is not likely with his familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, too, that many media had just stashed around him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"" "" "" "in the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood it, still eagerly wanting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report of Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media the news has been reported much about the issue of misuse with the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also placed some distortion or co-workers with regard to sexual abuse at last?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual persuasion claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never danced to talk to my father or mother about it," said a subject of sufferers for the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzingers rate a role in terms of abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a respondent student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case, in which he could have had timely knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to suppose that it is expected to have an intruder or more clearly defined as compared to their parents, internatsguides, confidence instructors etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that it could not be confirmed in the run-run student and / or their environment in advance, could not be confirmed as part of the examination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As regards sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from any co-author.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be thrown into him, not to be prevented or brought to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradictory crimes, as it is unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much of" "" "non-violence" "" "with the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is discarded in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and distorted to a huge melange of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Then there will be clean separately: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Moreover, the report covers pre-incidents in the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible testing pedagogy, the cases where the lad of sadistically instructors have been shocked and malignant, all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to have left.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom had nothing to do with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the young only to face when she had already been on the Domspatzengina.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In what was the most witnesses emphasise, the subject of "pre-school" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "it was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzenginal School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann has been a discipline, but there was no dictatorship of violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims led the general humanity from R. R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even combine positive memories with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most still the accusation has to be sheltered.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which he was reported by the states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he started to establish itself and was not responsible for the events in a school, where he didn't want to hear and responsible (such a witness) nothing, and then again to 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently puts the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengänge, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points to that," "" "that in pre-school the auditors will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the light of the risk of negative press, he recommended an urgent one-step forward.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as a certificate was also banned in Bavaria too long.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that she occurred in a legal gray area, as each one of us is still white.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was difficult to estimate for him, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border has been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But it is not possible to say, he could have always been cursed.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test was officially established in Bavaria at the same time in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it is unfair, to apply today's pedagogical standards on the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," thus the danger, past and present moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">There the princess has been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of resilience and violence at unschool children, which goes far beyond that time evil.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all quite awful and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus earnestly and to pull her hair and ears, were widely spread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As physical continuance then it was forbidden, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What image of his Regensburger Time has played Georg Ratzinger because in conversation with you for the book "My brother of Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the issue of the test came to the language too?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesman: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, "tells of his perspective, there the cathedral-cats played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I am not at all by no means that he introduced a stricter regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once again: without this perfectionist, without which we demand unconditional discipline, it would be hardly possible for him to form an institution of Weltrang, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went their tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonons alone, one does not make any big singers and stand before every success equal to which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">And what kind of man did you experience George Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesman: through working on the book and in addition, I really met Georg Ratzinger really very well and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, primeable, deep believing and heartfelt good people from which one can't imagine that he could not only do some fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly come with, like many former cathedral-cats still today, 23 years after its empowerment, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him today that he was strictly speaking to them, therefore they are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of them are grateful to him today that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, fatherless teacher - a stricter father, certainly that may be - but also a adorable respect for the person was to look at them today and to honour them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly, all that one casts to him are guardians that were at that time on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because it is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial sin-goat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that is behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that was just published, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the anstanding areas, a 93-year-old man who has acquired huge earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen (finally found in peace).</seg>
