Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I always put into drawers in the drawers
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has made clear clear to the Hollywood star in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put in drawers in drawers or be@@ ad from outside label living with me and reality usually little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the wish to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh it that it is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as it is explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
at most loving the act@@ ress spends her time at home , with a TV with lo@@ wered Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the white , she also bring the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not be married or children have to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; child &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ ston , as a single @-@ immer@@ sive mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CH@@ IO : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Re@@ pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes , the horses rec@@ alled to their end , they hunt at home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed@@ backs .
a few kilometers at this pace , I have dre@@ amed of fear .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with that the equ@@ estrian itar@@ ist then ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament records - again close to horses .
he let him lead to his family through the complex of AL@@ RV on a horse , he does not ask for photo purposes .
the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Spor@@ thilfe survived the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Rec@@ pyramid .
for awards it lacks the symp@@ athetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen took him already .
long is the 18th @-@ winners of the pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only for@@ given for sports achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and in such a way the prize money of 25,000 Euro was the same .
with 15 other excellent sports@@ men , the two @-@ time Mast@@ ers@@ li@@ eger was recorded at Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
to the excellent include the athle@@ tic Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ gs Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the spring@@ leader Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these sports points were come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society ran into the spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tru@@ mp@@ s Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that is both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
the two US presidential insur@@ ers are however present in the tax and energy policy as well as in a manifes@@ to .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt rather small and war@@ ns against it , as the state of the economy cannot harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to bri@@ be the economy of death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand would be quite different , claimed Tru@@ mp .
he will put forward regulations massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates , for private individuals and for companies .
Clinton said to the other hand : the state has specific tasks to open , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money .
therefore , the taxes for the rich increases , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton said almost the password .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes into infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nation@@ alistic Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
thus , on Tru@@ mp , you could have a full of internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal power plants and continue to drive the cohesion funding in the US .
oil promotion should also be possible in so far @-@ protected areas to terminate the Paris climatic agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton on the other hand aims to strengthen and urges the renewable energies with her investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will make the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ azi@@ fish trade agreements , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both the US want to isol@@ ate not from international trade , but simply protect American jobs better .
they should then be paid better then , for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger .
he wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ all@@ up , then he says , he should not be changed .
however , the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold him before , that the budget deficit would be even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; any fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is for women who run alone , almost already for everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traum@@ atis@@ ed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby who is at most of one year old .
one has laid her little son in the arms .
he was curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother becomes star@@ ring on the table .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kiss@@ ed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a vehicle for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ per@@ ated .
in Munich , they live in Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has made the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich &apos;s Women &apos;s Aid .
long ago it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men there are no - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard on the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically tr@@ acked because they are torture or death or because their families send them as a presidential race to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when women weigh another reason for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary and forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that when she is anch@@ ored in Germany , ir@@ re , says B@@ ahr .
also here all the women of refugee camps can often be considered inferior and worse case abuse .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in Munich in the north of Munich , are traum@@ atic , appreci@@ ates them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women were so acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to say that they do nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help to help , there are more accommodations only for them , is calling for danger .
in Bavaria the seven district govern@@ s are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether it is of a similar project like in Munich in its area of jurisdiction , answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken about , there is such a thing in the accommodations of the governments .
also in Schw@@ aben alone , women alone are dis@@ accommod@@ ated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - and mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common @-@ standing floors or separate houses only for women @-@ based women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated from &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacking the privacy or become a person for men and women , it can come to - constant violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the laundry rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much women feel this protective needs , you can j@@ umped on the And@@ j@@ umped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the House in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since you have been around , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
assistance carriers : demands for new labour @-@ fighting measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representative of the Assi@@ stance institutions have called their union to approve new labour @-@ efforts in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Do@@ ctors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council , starting early September more labour @-@ acting measures .
the J@@ DC said that there was ministers responsible to respond to the concerns over the contract .
in July , Assi@@ stance and Medical studies have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday Saturday on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government would persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , which resulted in which the contract was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board voted on to fully reject the proposed new contract and requested official re@@ negotiations for all parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC made a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council today in order to approve a running program escal@@ ating labour measures , beginning of September .
the disputes led to that Assi@@ stance in this year thre@@ aten the first total sei@@ zur@@ es in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Assi@@ stance Prof. Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to rej@@ ecting the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that occurred even before the voting through 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medi@@ t@@ inst@@ ud@@ ent , with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted .
after the vote the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim the official end of the eight months of long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in receipt , I cannot rep@@ el me of expression that Ankara seeks most of that reconciliation .
there was the greeting , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile recently g@@ alli@@ ed and he radi@@ ates barely warmth , even for its back @-@ back relationships .
Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could no longer count it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day pro@@ pul@@ sion a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan would have heard so would never be something worse .
to me his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin out of radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the state of Russia had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes : the down@@ ing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was burnt .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to enjoy Russia in the back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; going on was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to rebuild the Vet@@ ro@@ en again becomes difficult if not even impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months the state @-@ controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack in Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at once it seemed to be the Turks for all the guilt .
the accus@@ ations of senior officials were the accus@@ ations that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family could have benef@@ ited from the illegal oil trade in territories of Syria , which is controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has taken this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting occurred only because Putin received the excuse for Putin who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ceas@@ e@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends who he can get after he was the last month with a failed coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic moti@@ fs .
Russian sanctions have taken hard on Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed .
you are counting on a late seasonal storm in the Mediterranean .
this week forecast the government television approved fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti imagined it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry on the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
to this end , the continuing Gro@@ ll about the sn@@ ail speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the er@@ pi@@ ke is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus for ensuring that he urged government to support the elected government bodies .
this is well @-@ evident for Moscow and has a matter of course , that himself has a deep @-@ sitting fear of regime change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this beautiful palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , as an an@@ alysts once described , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries occupied by the West and are badly dealt with . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two still differences .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey have contradi@@ ct@@ ory sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of initial talks , both Presidents met at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even have stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey clari@@ fies it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as the NATO member of Turkey ra@@ ging the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for clients outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the head of the Bank C@@ BS , the brand R@@ BS should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the head of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the brand R@@ BS connected with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since long distances itself , when she had almost collabor@@ ated and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in that time bran@@ str@@ ate@@ gen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they supported the international sport with millions pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and IP@@ O are changed to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are others , smaller brands for the retail store , which will receive more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand as well as the brand that will be employed by our employees , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global targets , but to pursue local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that the Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will no longer continue to be able to increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsorship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus in the inner ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the head office .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and put these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you &apos;ll see many changes .
we can restore these marks again , so I think that the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains his 3,@@ 000@@ th gain in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ying Champagne after an Double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured British profits on Friday his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
he put on Pre@@ ci@@ ction that is trained by John Gos@@ ling , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pigment , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the dre@@ im@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori that previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it has happened at New@@ market because I survived 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ ital Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ations when he gets the victory on Pre@@ al@@ ction .
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a re@@ fine career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ god , the ninth der@@ mat@@ te had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 care@@ ers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone so few of them reached .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambass@@ ador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma , fans been enthusiastic for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6,000 profits , if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has suffered a winner in the UK almost 30 years which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
a whole series of Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ win , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban .
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month Sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive power to de@@ fy its branches and to return to his stock .
and he is still not in the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russian Putin dam@@ s Stab@@ i Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dis@@ missed his Stab@@ i Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged without indication of reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who has been Ivan@@ ov since 2012 was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 he was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ation at the prestigious President of the Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) , that he was later log into protocol and head managers of the government personnel .
he said about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state of law concerning the legislative and controls of implementing your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday , that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the most ridic@@ ulous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin in and works like he is for the Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin , who was broadcast on television , the two men claimed that the sche@@ du@@ ck returned to his own wish .
but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here lies the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
that knows currently no one .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president , would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin that quotes on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years long .
as it turns out , I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
he previously was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the state security service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , as Putin Chairman of the Federal Security service ( FS@@ B ) was appointed to the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his dep@@ uty .
when Putin went to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who he trusted .
once , Ivan@@ ov was elected to Putin &apos;s second term President of Russia as a third presidential term against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally Putin &apos;s , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister , before he returned to the President thirteen and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son found after he proposed producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announce their cancellation in a common opinion .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , apologi@@ zed to the Thursday before the announcement of his termination publicly .
in the set there was about artistic differences and differences of opinion .
I rep@@ ent the incident , &quot; he said in a message .
details of how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which is followed by a team of F@@ BI agents , are expected to be published according to the ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played at the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was the first rel@@ ay of the series in 2005 with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal power and put my whole life in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Gib@@ son in a Friday published report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be to the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would simply like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the planned appearance of the twel@@ fth season is set on 28 September .

Queens@@ sie Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four resolutions of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover @-@ off@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brid@@ ging of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of iron .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
business Minister K@@ eit@@ h Brown concluded a visit to the job@@ site today and was one of the first , who went to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ zu cros@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering experience of a truly ep@@ ic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which alone were used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
altogether , almost 79 % of the entire bridge go on their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets a beta test today at Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is prepared to be taken up on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Constru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first reference is a significant milestone in each brid@@ ging project .
with this fantastic project the closure is tr@@ end@@ setting and deep @-@ building .
after the installation of the last street session and its connection to the northwest of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side .
this was reached in the south by dra@@ gging the northern edge bridge 700 millimeters .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activities .
massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , approximately 6,000 tons weighs and at a slope of about 3 % had to be drawn up .
delicate , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny , on each side they have only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men still have the chance to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were dis@@ car@@ ded by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ station was placed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim , while her boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around him and placed us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily , the strong win@@ ch had already blow@@ n the boat apart from its reach until we left water &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and on a boat without lif@@ egu@@ ards .
they all came aboard the seaside resort and were brought back to the ambul@@ ance service station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a not@@ ch , although there is a not@@ ch , but this proceeds from the person going on by the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has awakened today about these men .
difficult to hurt - man sti@@ cht on his ex @-@ friend

who builds up cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green My : investors should be much stronger in future in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept living in the next mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet controversy is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a provision is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group Leader Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas will need to show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can also be found in the stock .
the big issue in the town hall is however , as viol@@ as : &quot; how to build with investors that want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban building programme , which will cost millions of cost and must be financed , is intended to provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as viol@@ as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the political groups &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left wants to increase hardness for investors .
regardless of this , as viol@@ a , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market is tense .
if the action concept is implemented , it will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
yet the program is not entirely available : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of about 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments whose promotion is going out over the next few years ?
by the year 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , so the plann@@ er speaking in Nicole Palm , should now purchase orders of the city .
moreover , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into price @-@ binding .
this is possible in the West town .
in one fell s@@ woo@@ p the problem can be solved .
because in the West town the end of the year is running out .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price @-@ binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
for the number of social housing in the west town is dramatically increased , it is removed from the target of the so @-@ called mixing .
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens therefore reck@@ on that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must go into a boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
have concentrated on more building sites for single family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
that te@@ ens and child to play no longer outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , on screens , was caught up in the last decade of many lam@@ ents .
at Po@@ k@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and to leave more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to video games , then on video games and recently on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer of course to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later , resulting from a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of population sunk in front of the publication of the game in the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphone outside and look for Po@@ k@@ é@@ m@@ ons which are re@@ trac@@ ed with a GPS as soon as they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game as they were younger , joined to the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang up for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game has led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users followed , the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of tr@@ ackable people that train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 per cent .
the company does not know who of which Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go plays - it only sees the raw data on performance improvement .
many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to come , &quot; from the sofa to come , &quot; and &quot; every day are active in de@@ af ear because many public messages are boring to health and coming from people who look like .
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ evaluated .
those who drives regularly sport reduces its chances to get cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there are also Moravian games that have to always complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it ?
it has been a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow earlier our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drift sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its attraction and use it with time .
because of poker &apos;s success , however , more games will give more games , the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism will be combined in the real world and assist many people in hunting , more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ ge@@ kl@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ rate title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
its total result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly in front of the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .

Bil@@ a is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who gains a multi @-@ rate title and in total the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fies their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at this moment .
this success makes them in the same league like unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ a has dominated the last three years of its sport , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u b@@ ang from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
they expected an last check in Brazil , a competition which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not having a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas back , would be considered a disappointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace themselves after they have won gold and silver in the single multi@@ battle of women in the art of art during the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,

although Bil@@ a existed , during their long trail to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true .
part of their exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is in Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .

Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them by being her grand@@ son - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears abo@@ unded at Bil@@ a shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a re@@ venge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year team of teams , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;

police : 3 victims in serial mur@@ der@@ ers when listening in the car
according to police report that were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girls have been killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial mur@@ der@@ ers of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ ing weapon while he arose on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report to read .
the police told that thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory attack , as the att@@ acker doesn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , owned by one of the adult victims .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting is investig@@ ating the investig@@ ators to get a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dwell@@ ings were killed in nine months in nine months and two more wounded .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown Nissan to the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to gain evidence that they led to the conclusion that attacks are linked to and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injury and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned out for an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of mass mur@@ ders .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and safest a ball from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the motor room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ halia : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and naturally his mother .
but like the least of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cep@@ halia has failed the result of a genetic disorder that did not know his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I didn &apos;t do that .
I do not create this .
I did not let myself down .
what is not true at all -- of course you have left to it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund they can never realize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to person@@ alize it .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cr@@ ush up to his third years and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him strings in &quot; , told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical drawing language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ halia has a variety of causes : genetic like with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ans or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is affecting the life of the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an un@@ certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I have not been asking for a progn@@ osis for a long time , because I do not expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eless reason for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it is better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fierce ra@@ inf@@ alls , floods gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor about it , on Friday the emergency shot . it will be considered all the Saturday with more ra@@ inf@@ all .

the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Ed@@ wards told that citizenship in constant contact with local authorities stand and help to the communities affected are already on the road .
Mike Ste@@ els , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ity of the governor , shared with that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags spread .
Ste@@ els said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a would have requested ten thousand sand bags .
a flood system is used across wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service provided that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall into rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas was used on Friday a floo@@ d@@ early breakfast system while it ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite in the vicinity of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , who are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach over the weekend record level .
the Met@@ ere@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could be in@@ und@@ ated many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a up@@ surge backward floods in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , since these are flowing in the Lake of Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the River Dra@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level in Friday at 09.@@ 00 , ever recorded .
rescue team still sli@@ pped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the district Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his boots were found among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet from his house , overnight strongly rising .
he said that him was another step@@ son who had been close by him .
&quot; we are awake and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford .
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived there during the 48 years in which she had lived there , never had such a high tower of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had saved all three in a big military truck and they had brought them to the next fire @-@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated up to Friday .

in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodation have been set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will again go back to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two twi@@ sting streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents to take up , the hope to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last big floods that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the Municip@@ al Institu@@ tions .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Al@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continued to rain on the Golf@@ küste .
according to its details a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday we were not reported until now .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls crazy , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave me that Brown suffered several ro@@ uss@@ ars , including in the lungs , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transportation to hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was sp@@ iced by balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ore Mel@@ ende@@ z the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can simply not believe that .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympic Games and that for more than one reason .
first of all I have been at every summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ ast , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie , Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in is , rounds , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one under the female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics , and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness to the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who gained in an individual multi @-@ phase event for women gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are witness@@ ing the top of this sport , but so see gym in the whole country not out .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it in the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; L@@ ended Five &quot; because the next olymp@@ ic team will have four tur@@ ers in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks so that gymn@@ asts is a cost@@ lier sport and gymn@@ asts , which can be maintained by parents , which are suitable for training , furnishing , travel - and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ers and families ) .
the majority of this turn@@ around are located in wealthy suburbs , which can support business .
in these verses , the Tur@@ ner receives its entire training and that is a good and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the tur@@ f .
we have to be inspired to the communities of countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to make a performance and easier to access .
I founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
we offer free and affordable tur@@ fs in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trains national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ mo@@ il develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for the health as well as for school@@ ing and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Dutch team of the olymp@@ ic team , and thanks , F@@ ass you motivated so many young girls with different background to start their path , healthy , strong and successful young women .
medicines would like to organise other strikes after they refused Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assistance institutions , who voted in a choice , rejected him .
in July , Hunt plans had unveil@@ ed the contract to introduce the contract and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance systems should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of un@@ favourable movements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ bin@@ aries for assistance institutions held last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance practitioners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the proposed contract still serious concerns , in particular that there will be the current staff crisis and to treat all physicians to treat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for only eight weeks , which are still remaining , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts from BM@@ A to solve the dispute through talks are taking part in the government on the sake and sometimes on the de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it came to pass that of a promise , that Jerem@@ y Hunt was only last month over it , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt needs to act now , lift up the penetration and address the concerns of assistance institutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he did not do so , the Assi@@ stance has made clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of almost 13@@ ,000 routine practice and 100,000 dates before , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant doctors on the strip @-@ post@@ esc@@ ort .
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to have a better wave re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS staff , urged the Assi@@ stance to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working measures can be achieved only little , but it has already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing care and their families only worries , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the Com@@ memor@@ andum of Assi@@ stance and with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries , responded positively to the concerns about tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility at training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training courses and the gender @-@ specific wage gap in medicine - a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the observance of agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug , the heart of heart is reduced
thousands of heart @-@ coloured patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after having recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the cl@@ ot@@ ating drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for persons with a cardi@@ ac disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the regul@@ ators Nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ators Nice of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulating fatty material in the arter@@ ies , the flo@@ or@@ ings form .
if the Bel@@ ag van@@ ishes , it may cause a blood circulation containing blood flow through to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and obstru@@ ct the flow of blood to the brain , which causes a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the merchant &apos;s name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the design proposal of Nice , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor car@@ le Long@@ son , director of the Nice health engineering center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have substantial negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reduction of other heart attack and stroke cases is , who already had a heart attack .
by provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are glad that we are able to expand available treatment options for thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the ab@@ duc@@ tor recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ cia &apos;s election was flour@@ ished in Muslim regions
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to res@@ ign@@ ation of corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor has led to that extended election was not know@@ ingly ignor@@ ant in Muslim communities , such as a cr@@ ushing government report today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks verbal police , election and Rath@@ en@@ gre@@ ments to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; Over@@ sensi@@ tivities regarding eth@@ ni@@ cities and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , who now had a cor@@ rupted campaign , said that the intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be the police to set off distances outside of electoral boards to protect sho@@ ot@@ ted voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a ID to himself in order to prove their identity by elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er has to call only its name and address .
the report proposes to wear un@@ removable ink on the finger of a person when they give up their choices to prevent somebody twice chosen .
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he requests that the press should have more access to public documents and decisions of non @-@ official comm@@ ent@@ aries or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against electoral fraud but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial intermedi@@ ary culture , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ and@@ als in the East of London .
last year , a Special Tribunal was decided that the acting mayor lasted for Rah@@ man according to a sol@@ it@@ ant and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ated the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he could have suffered his critics with se@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man ought to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation in which a person is chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he is particularly alar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter - for the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to puri@@ fy the electoral system , including the drilling out to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; as evidence was attached that pressure on vulnerable members was exercised by some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the Will of El@@ der , in particular communities with Pakistan or ban@@ ish background .
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions should not know@@ ingly ignor@@ es such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to puri@@ fy the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letters , in order to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choices &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which is taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tough@@ er registration re@@ trac@@ tions to prevent the electoral path to Im@@ mig@@ rat@@ ory and social fraud purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing after your ID .
do not removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent somebody twice chosen .
systematic review on the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit to applications on an automatic brie@@ fing .
prohibition that political activ@@ ism have complete letters and covers of letter @-@ elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police will give the authority to set up sli@@ ders around electoral stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in law which facilitates an indictment because of intim@@ id@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law in 1983 ) .
photography ban in voting stations .
request that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees rule enforce that voters alone go to the electoral board .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case had no criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for the corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not guilty for a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - as guilty .
he also critic@@ ised the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the constitu@@ ent divisions of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Angel Tower in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covered spread of election was and leu@@ g@@ ation of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ detached in and other famous twin @-@ go@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are over this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot besides edge and band got out , which proved to be an impressive Double @-@ predecessor in the Her@@ zo@@ gin of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year olymp@@ ic kin is by far not the only one in order to have gold fighters that has its own famous double go@@ ers - at least not if you give the social media faith .
to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ck@@ ering at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ans who have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Horn@@ í .
the hunters and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
besides K@@ ates Double @-@ predec@@ essors on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people on the internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher of the Gem@@ ini &apos;s Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o might be .
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secre@@ tly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to him that he already gets to hear since his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hairy , &quot; distributed Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a ben@@ ign guy , so I miss that probably as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the enligh@@ tening simil@@ arity between the British hill Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be able to pass through a double @-@ predecessor in the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user thinks that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another attached comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medals of Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ on@@ ant hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan Adrian by fans was attacked , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual shape and eye
not the single : a Twitter user was very happy that others are also like the similarities .
theory placed in the room : according to this user there is for the simil@@ arity of the couple maybe a reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ ene stated her satisfaction , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact the U.S. football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter a incredibly similar visual shape and eyes .
another popular Ver@@ das Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medals in Tur@@ ing Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , broad smile , that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was turned out , when he reached his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ est@@ rel .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ator of C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; color &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went down as mice , died like a pig .

the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than a Canadian Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the c@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .

the cri@@ tique against Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard when he asked him many questions .
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how un@@ ensi@@ bly Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah wrote : &quot; WO@@ W , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and leaves us all like R@@ assi@@ sts look . # ange@@ ec@@ ked .
short time later apologi@@ zed Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we apologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
it was a unhappy chosen phrase , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC apologi@@ ze for the end of over 90 times with the people who have responded to the crew on Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ atory report Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copies and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had worth the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also apologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message out .
we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible to broadcast it .
last night we quickly apologi@@ ze for our viewers on the broadcast and our followers in social media .
to clear one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were un@@ reasonable and a unhappy formula . Byr@@ on does what he said , very tired .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald has been used to justify Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s cre@@ eping in the C@@ BC Olympic , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have applied to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no cont@@ emp@@ t , and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ indi@@ gn@@ ant on woman who tried in the middle of business under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where they should see , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try cap@@ p@@ ants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered them as they looked at it , she went out and put them back into the shelf .
she travelled further and pro@@ bi@@ ated four pair of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman moved the under@@ p@@ ants before returning it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buy something . &quot;
she said , &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the pit , pulled off their own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and pro@@ oted them .
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there , fre@@ t like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she went back the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously don &apos;t like it , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that her had nothing to go back and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she watched somebody - or about the person who under circumstances would buy the under@@ p@@ ants who tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how contradi@@ ct@@ ory to think that someone had any sub@@ tro@@ users with home that had another person and which have not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Mrs David@@ son said : &quot; as I joined , the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and figure out that another woman had she and did not have washed off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone , un@@ aware . &quot;
all products in question have been drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ ana in New York to find out how to walk with armed rob@@ bers .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn around for your rob@@ ber .
if one gets closer to you from the back then you should re@@ turn off as the order , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the wal@@ nut , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the gun then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with her knees in the body and rot@@ ate , while the att@@ acker drops against pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back@@ wards , while the weapon directed toward him .
at att@@ ackers , which approach itself from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the wal@@ nut , grab the gun and rot@@ ate them , so that the ag@@ gres@@ s@@ ors cannot shoot .
shift the weight to the gun at the same time and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon directed towards it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi pres@@ et .
but remember that there is a smoke on the safest area to transfer your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .

the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing of a draw@@ back chain , that was already used by thousands others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive but actually are in a kitchen flush more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of gut bacteria , as well as about his own health .
fortunately left nothing that he no@@ d@@ ded , more than a bad post@@ p@@ ack in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by the world jour@@ ne@@ yed and peculi@@ ar as well as wonderful things ate .
from public terrain to train stations to flus@@ hing out toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under one sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was fair to his reputation .
the one that he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its trial coating showed a L@@ umin@@ ometer number of over 4000 units .
in comparison to the L@@ umin@@ ometric hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject , after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry over 4000 units was , while freshly squee@@ zed hands one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ dated &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ ron@@ th , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes to the worst thing I did in a toilet , near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I will not miss anything here because it is in@@ geni@@ ous here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ explosive &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products vali@@ o .
the company hand@@ et Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both milit@@ ant bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ kov@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explained the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy Bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming by that that we told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass told us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer of more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the direc@@ ting of the film , added : &quot; let me say it so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , when he had made some of things to instru@@ ct him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to indul@@ ge them and others , where this was rather difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of vali@@ dated survey conducted by 2015 84 per cent of all surv@@ eyed l@@ actic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 per cent said that they are at least sometimes use products that included me@@ et@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us .

a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social @-@ apartment after a del@@ usion with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 , because they had terrorist their neighbours .
T@@ anya skel@@ don and its partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were removed from their estate , sho@@ cked the housing co@@ operatives found the property in a mis@@ leading condition .
the walls were glu@@ ed holes on , wood@@ em@@ bers were disper@@ sed , gar@@ bage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was shot to the walls .
the family were turned around and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the administrative office at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
she said , &quot; It was a night@@ mare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is probably seen as not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , the inter@@ time lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street struggles with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ers , intim@@ id@@ ances of inhabitants , drug abuse , drug stores and excessive scre@@ ams , stretching and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the rental agreement , got an order for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances becomes demol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
it were tra@@ ded in the estate , in which drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past , the wood boards
neighbours said that they saw them on the streets and regularly inv@@ oked the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing stri@@ pped her and her partner this week by the estate , after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to draw up voluntarily .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication were che@@ ated by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said their life to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She arose to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today tomorrow we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood there because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had caused the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the community house , trash and old toys were dis@@ car@@ ded
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a shame that it &apos;s the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family as a del@@ usion is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and they had to look at their deeds for their neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have brave and have sent us the information .
I hope that this development will come from several neighbours and the message is convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they all were over 20 .
a dirty mattress , left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ ing on the ground left .
workers of the household management are now to be spar@@ se car@@ vings that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
skel@@ eton received an imprisonment after being found guilty of the ownership of a drug of class B in commercial sight .
they claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don is , who did live in an automobile accident in 2013 .
having stayed without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partners are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were consumed by gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they are ten@@ ant @-@ ten@@ ant , who do not adhere to the house order
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall divided with that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ant , who do not adhere to the house order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can do without self @-@ cat@@ ches and those who were damaged by such behaviour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

presidential did@@ act Donald Tru@@ mp has now published weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ spl@@ ant and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire said something like concerns vo@@ iced , such as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success grow in the struggle for the White House .

a survey of Surv@@ ey@@ US in June , according to Tru@@ mp and his bank@@ rupt from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ in@@ ely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that are common for re@@ public@@ s candidates in the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as endangered also , Arizona and Georgia are also valid .
in an interview of the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered Tru@@ mp the question how he wants to stop the advance Clin@@ tons again : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be it in order , said Tru@@ mp .
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tru@@ mp is said to submit funds to support his election campaigns , he should not be able to present any better conver@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

and then there was Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel I , oh so , I feel and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .

it is an in@@ geni@@ ous man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Dud@@ am@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !

&quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ vul@@ sion urged that the federal government positioned itself as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wit@@ hunting hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ar@@ rests were destroyed as a freight @-@ trailer , instru@@ ctors and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on gri@@ pping trunk , incidentally , also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Turks already asked before the coup in front of the coup d for political persecution acknowledged in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the beginning of June 30 , this will be 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus have been under 29 percent of all recognised as an asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this survey , not the before war , poverty or fu@@ tiv@@ eless@@ ness will not be re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated .
asylum @-@ entitled according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so by state side , individually per@@ sec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go there , where there is we@@ h@@ ers &quot;
stran@@ ts Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the land@@ day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will not be held once again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for blocks of the as so far it is not : summer holidays , He@@ at and Land@@ s@@ war@@ dness - this is possible .
the locals who want to convince by the leaders are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen , or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , therefore are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
these come practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , posters infl@@ amed , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers , and en@@ umer@@ ate in the end of voices , can only apply aw@@ ful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; up to 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go over themselves by the people in the election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hot phase , when you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win S@@ ell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , now lies in the pol@@ ls clearly behind the CD@@ U .
thrilling is thrilling , how much new@@ com@@ ing af@@ D is st@@ acked and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ zer .
s@@ ell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 government of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents .
he travels through the land , disper@@ ses and chat a little with the people , just as it did already be the legendary liter@@ al predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors get cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame at the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ascent of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is probably going to cost the beautiful office now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top channel data , the interior of the Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place campaign .
it has been invited to a chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major countries ; Merkel &apos;s agr@@ arian group lies in the Nor@@ theast Latvia .
but the target group did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other Länder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ endant Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the northeast CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual choice of choices on market places and on m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so Kok@@ ert , plays only an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the Union has marked that you are on the basis of the base , that it must be very rigor@@ ous to find a wire to the people again .
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , the Gre@@ ens : in the v@@ ini@@ ties of the country hardly any available .
the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ election Kok@@ ert to his fellow @-@ election is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you must go there , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , each birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot stands at stake , S@@ ell@@ ering has now called for a particularly engaged election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind Partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the African D ( 19 ) .
in the election in 2011 , the SPD was still clearly won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , are likely to make the jump into the farm .
they do not make a modern virtue of the holidays @-@ need , and put their constitu@@ tive cl@@ ash to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online electoral campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the provincial Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the green election of electoral campa@@ ign@@ ers search for native stim@@ ul@@ ls among the tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ lay@@ ered , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ or@@ st lakes and finds it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ reconstruction : guest sites suffer from block@@ age
at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ group@@ ed , there is nothing to complain about .
for the persons responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and end only at 20 am , there are all@@ ets praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did everything pretty delicate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no default .
the construction site could be moved to the south on the weekend to the south after the end of October until the end of October it should be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is praised that the decision is responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up Beh@@ el@@ hr@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site on Monday to south is immig@@ rated and also the block of asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is restored , the traffic situation in the village has relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen near the B 27 again .
different traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; says the principal management of the restructuring responsible for the restructuring of the University of Florian King .
the inhabitants of Bach@@ stein Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner and Wei@@ her@@ rain had been struggling with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ ams were examined and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what does this lead to maneu@@ ver truck in living areas .
because the speed limit has not been met , the community has reinforced the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there was considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself on site about the situation .
two to three per minute have been planted .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 h per hour in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men are not happy to see in the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ reconstruction in them has led to sales growth , everyone is asked to look through .
however , some more and some are affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for other companies , the restoration has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum light drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also one that of course is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the strongest paved areas are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already an existence of existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the sites made it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ a@@ eil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
in &quot; far more than 50 percent of the sales figures , the sales revenue grew to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the road @-@ con@@ sign@@ ment brought its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of its employees have to release them .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be an financial compensation , with the critic , the restaurant benef@@ ited otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 Now it must also be the disadvantages that carry out through the renov@@ ations .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where is something gener@@ ously gr@@ asp@@ ed .
with all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business is already settled in 17@@ 15 , it points to the long history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other tri@@ bal guests are now able to pay less frequently because of the complicated road transport , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you cannot drive it , it is also elsewhere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about the end of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 building construction based on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the counter @-@ terrorism in laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , interior ministers de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presents a thick security package .
but what has a spec@@ ulation status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the ens@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Minister of the Federal Minister for Justice in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are demanding no one .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in the participation of the participation .
but as Minister of Interior , he was located at the results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach left a little time , before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , denoun@@ ced : that a new security authority should take care of the b@@ aking ded @-@ encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU def@@ aults and weapons to aviation law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety authorities is not surprising .
partly , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for suggestions which were not to be done with the SPD so far : he wants to face sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and with double citizenship at the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adm@@ its to the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will still consider this for reasonable and demands nothing , which in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner does not have any chances whatsoever .
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he is planning rapid procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before the de@@ portation .
refugees that are targeted to the country should be able to check their Smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security inspection before their smartphone .
for D@@ ul@@ s for exp@@ ired asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or reject their papers to di@@ vul@@ ge their identity .
some of them is politically and legally delicate .
man@@ ia still works un@@ folded and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be expressed in abstr@@ action that the attacks were of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
there were also many people concerned about the high refugee quot@@ as and the safety .
and things that are deeply occupied by the people , now they were not inter@@ cl@@ inging themselves in the election of election .
the internal security is enormous into the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
and yes , there are choice .
the Union and the SPD can therefore increasingly express themselves in their position in the subject of internal security .
in the past few days there went high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ rison argument over the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the res@@ ellers also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also concerned with irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return of the double @-@ pass he is nothing .
we have the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ ate it , be not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he made constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition , it must still show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
but the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ secu@@ te internal security during the subject of internal security .
Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first of careful talk and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to raising security . &quot;
still comes Volkswagen gli@@ ders .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als increase the supply @-@ up worldwide .
but not all markets are running smoothly .
in the recall campaign there is vor@@ tex for a term .
Volkswagen starts in the second half @-@ year with the deliveries .
in the course of the previous year , Europe &apos;s largest highways can be further advanced in spite of the diesel , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ going markets .
but in July , the core of the VW is weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and is now res@@ ili@@ ent to res@@ ale once again , as the companies presented in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW is sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
only in Western Europe , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany s@@ ack@@ ted the disp@@ at@@ ches around almost a six @-@ sixth .
brand @-@ tri@@ c@@ ed@@ f Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ est figures from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has been given in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; a department store .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote failed to be bur@@ dened for the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ tor got escal@@ ate first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house of the Nieder@@ s@@ achsen is already further gli@@ de due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is only a supplier minus of 0.@@ 9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles to be be@@ ech .
consolidated sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler could forward a sales board from January to July .
1,3 percent more vehicles supplied by Volkswagen in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with software de@@ qu@@ ests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , it does not give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance no deterioration .
the motor@@ auer address the customer after the modification of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate events .
reason for legal c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been reporting , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee of rest@@ ru@@ sting diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the State Department has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the conditions of my investigation Commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discre@@ pan@@ cies will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after the conversion is no longer able to take place and all type @-@ relevant vehicle assets will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it meant to be in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen provides the possibility that customers come for example a half year after conversion to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage , which at all , nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ sc@@ andal is to be considered un@@ locking with regard to possible cav@@ eat rules , as it was called .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in the future of offen@@ ders - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 clients who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ us or daily @-@ cash accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banks speaks of one individual and does not see this signal : normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must not be feared to pay for their savings of criminal off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund starting from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ us or day @-@ cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will cost 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been around 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other , and which could not be invali@@ dated from one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those are on me in the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost he will give on after the urs@@ ors principle .
the cash simply lie in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced &apos; already four accidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bankroll .
most customers would have understanding and alter@@ nat@@ ely on other investment forms .
only a few walking to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it alone is not possible to bear alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with offen@@ ders for deposits from three million euros had made the Thur@@ in@@ gia folk and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger country with its sk@@ ating bench branch 2014 head@@ lines .
Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leader of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay surface cover for deposits , in addition , competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said , on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chin area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is equipped with a wealth of wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank if they charge money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 was founded co @-@ operative G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region the well @-@ known actor , athletes and entrepreneurs .
the cooperative @-@ association Bavaria , &quot; are currently no further banks known to charge a compensation for deposits of private clients , &quot; said speaker Ernst .
the President of the Federation of the German Pop@@ ular Banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June , &quot; The threshold , to neg@@ atives to the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition was tough , and it dro@@ ught the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not like this in the width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound@@ proo@@ fing ?
lonely men of middle age love plates .
before you go to the comm@@ ent@@ ment , to re@@ w him under the alias of non @-@ avenue of men with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement leads out of current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the emergence of sound of sound is not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to the Mid@@ life Nost@@ al@@ gia .
those who bought recently a record are all predi@@ ctions between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely co@@ d group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance : older flat runners retain their feelings sooner for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I lie in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a humble gray attack and wild , before I go standing , stop my hands and tell a certain determin@@ ant , such as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let us take a look at it .
even if the heart So@@ hos is slowly holding in his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where no independent sellers were possessions - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to cher@@ ish their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle age , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably around the 20 ) is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , depicted in the top ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , k@@ ills the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and used again objects which he sold as he was young and bank@@ rupt .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was some young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy the records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much .
this is my L@@ aster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers , which he meets to meet the You@@ g@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let themselves go back to buy their old records .
of the conversations that I have led , people usually have tried so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy them again their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound platform , from objects that are happy to be happy .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a empt@@ iness or possessions of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ B .
this is as a collector with me and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ utes a staff from a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month has not yet been heard .
the survey took out that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , whereas 7 % of those who buy a record does not have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very anxi@@ ous while I bl@@ under through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) has noticed a &apos; trop@@ y pe@@ pper &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone was recently released here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not own record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more produc@@ ts@@ ky , less musi@@ cl@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not elderly , which are only slowly coming up .
bas@@ p , which has dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience , when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women middle age .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops - Wild Be@@ ast New thes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ dre@@ amed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ oni@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them look similar , but na@@ mental mental trau@@ mat@@ a are difficult to as@@ cer@@ tained , if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for several minutes in business and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
it is more of a man@@ ic mor@@ eper than a big one .
it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a de@@ ar@@ ched si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a shop , of which is said that a new generation of record @-@ lovers is supposed to have : urban Out@@ f@@ itters .
while I give to pattern the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , I watch a group of young teenage boys , group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ table player .
on the left there is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics that are essential records for an average collection .
nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch it .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research results , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v , leave them , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the great number of female collectors and record @-@ lovers who exist in reality , record business and in online @-@ for@@ es , un@@ taken into account .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
you will not spend their Thursday morning with safety not by record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while in the star@@ ring of a un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator ste@@ er , that prot@@ ru@@ des over the shoulders of the middle age .

French dish re@@ jects the offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French dish has rejected a special offer of authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais to live in the thousands of refugees living .
in a court proceedings , this week argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops , in which persons within the bearing goods , sell cigarettes up to en@@ erg@@ y@@ soft , sell , hair@@ dressing services or provide tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Calais argued that these places should be down@@ cus@@ hion , because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and stability risks .
humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals , which are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing figures in the camp .
in addition they were out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille chose that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ elling of people who operate 72 provisional shops but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Calais will be absolutely in@@ comprehensible . &quot;
the judges Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely to feed people who live &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers provide .
one of the places that was threatened by defe@@ ats was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated with a non @-@ profit , and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants discovered on Friday that the number of living in the jungle living has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany Ras@@ er must focus on the next generation of speed measurements : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should lead to Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic @-@ effective En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on in@@ genu@@ ity where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway building or to sandy bridges with temporary l@@ bur@@ ner , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary combination for compliance with speed limit .
a lasting mobile building can however be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery holds five days for uninterrupted measurement of five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
laser measuring technology can also be detected at the same time all vehicles over several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as routing systems according to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced state you can move the trailer according to manufacturers with every car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that he is not easy to cl@@ ed , it is lo@@ wered in the measuring operation , so the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and incidentally will also disappear .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the l@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to the specifications of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .

Britain will pick silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the deadline stage .
Fi@@ ji experienced a master class in the handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , pushing , liner and rotating power to win gold - their first olymp@@ ic medal of any color .
the defeat was reconc@@ iled by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver Medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ k , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could go back to it in the final .
but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have taken a 15 @-@ man team in stock .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck . Fi@@ j@@ is Princip@@ al Ben Ry@@ an , the former chef for England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago it was lost at Ry@@ an every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this deck is blowing , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s made of fun dra@@ in .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co. at the end one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner touching .
with even four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack from the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly has the ball attached .
a hur@@ t@@ ful T@@ ing of Mitch@@ ell stops the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has only stopped fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a made a touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ p@@ ted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while UK is still da@@ un@@ ed .
this is how it is .
GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the relations of the first half @-@ time until Joshua ran through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had long run for a long time in favor of southern Iran , whose fans s@@ uns , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff par@@ ted , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced up and GB k@@ ingly cr@@ ush@@ ed down in the lawn .
formerly at the day , Fi@@ ji Japan was defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ k in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with impressive foot work and achieved a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ oma of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ fold team , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting cancer by the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres gold than with these games and that will mean what is called .
from the first rowing down to the last , 220 tough H@@ ieve , which enter into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the two , those who sat in the boat , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she joined the second Olympi@@ ad in two without tax house@@ wife , the first women in the history of British sports which placed on such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all its 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins which gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which is not the way of the tri@@ umph@@ ant to da@@ ze .
behind every gold in the ruin there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ der@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was nobody assistant than the coach , who would not survive this day before , when he was diagnosed with him cancer .
as he said , he was risky .
I had bladder cancer who is op@@ ul@@ able and that did it .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that in such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it starts .
the rub@@ les of itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger .
in the im@@ it@@ ability of victory went their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a nerve fir@@ ing morning at this time spent a little more than usual to talk and tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an operation in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I meant how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be nobody , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams started up from New Zealand and Denmark , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very at the moment caught .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let itself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make some Tol@@ les .
we wanted no fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a time for a year before it will make decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer of your Steve Back@@ shall .
now it just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to comprehend that I am an Olympi@@ ad .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better on , &quot; she said .
31 years long for clarity taken care of

the association is considered &quot; Bav@@ ern@@ far exemplary . &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
this was the name of some time in the original , in a contribution of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .

the work of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ te &quot; Bav@@ ern@@ far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , which was 31 years in the convenience association staff , of which 28 years as managing director .
he was passed to retirement in the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose @-@ association of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ group , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , which attracts approximately 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and hamlets with about 5@@ 500 residents .

&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work about office and organisational activities , the budget@@ ary production , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency attempts at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restoration of the High Authority ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial delivery of water lines .
there have been no st@@ agnation , and I have always recorded innovations , because water lives be@@ ute and drinking water the most important food be .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o she praised her faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used himself with a lot of heart@@ beat for his water @-@ purpose association and has lived in the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own business .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the track concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group for the nit@@ rates in front of the Wasser@@ forum District Court .
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ one on the one praised Aqu@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ der , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ ering and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he drew the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ struc@@ turing of the special @-@ association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ ping in the high @-@ vessel at church lau@@ er on a 3rd of January .
here at minus 17 degrees the whole night have to work , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at once can only be maintained once , because you filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ laugh@@ ing .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was transferred to Daniel storms of lou@@ der , which enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , mus@@ cular , brown and has a glow .
meanwhile the police have released a photo of him .
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a glow .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with himself , so the police .
who S@@ ven S. looks , the 110 call shall call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was year 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the official police in Lübeck did not want to make no information about the Ta@@ ther@@ fall or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher@@ in in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in meg@@ acities .
financial stresses that thre@@ aten the industry from the green electricity promotion , are from the table .
it abi@@ des in the liberation of the Renewable Energy Sec@@ tor for the so @-@ called self @-@ phase production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we were able to finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission had therefore planned first to request the steel producer , the gases coming from the Ho@@ cho@@ v to generate electricity for their own consumption .
the steel sector has allocated additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry sector .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a manifes@@ to with the European Commission for talks with competitive choirs Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel structures , all an EEG change of 20 percent .
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for their own production .
thus the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined .
the successful struggle made by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on the reform of the emissions right , climate and employment targets are &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said IG Metall @-@ chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation further intensified as the world @-@ largest producer China cast steel to the world market in view of the weak@@ ening of domestic demand mass@@ aged steel .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ cutting price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed .
on the one hand , the import of import duties on import duties , on the other hand , the economic prospects have turned into China .
unclear is how sustainable the price reco@@ vering .
the German branch pri@@ mus Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nating again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp did not intend to close any of the works of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were busy at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturer remain cau@@ tious despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced with 3,@@ 4 million tons of good six percent less raw steel than in the prior @-@ year @-@ year , as the economic certification of steel on Friday respectively .
after a short raise in May the amount was left behind the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is increased by two percent below the previous year &apos;s prior @-@ year figure .

the singing has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher studies , she won the com@@ partment of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a sen@@ iors .
&quot; sing me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; describes them .
after a sample they feel well @-@ balanced , cheerful and overall , she says .
in doing so , she is doing a good thing about her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler , from the German elderly .
most sen@@ iors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular coexistence , sen@@ iors can establish social contacts and maintain .
for frequently , social and family @-@ familiar structures at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , thinks h@@ ac@@ kler .
for the elderly are a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly asks his lungs even in everyday life not so fast from the p@@ est .
even though it is about getting the sound of voice in old age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
in the elderly , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federation of the sen@@ iors of the sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , the shared singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explains her .
L@@ enz often observed that the singing or listening of songs with older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies concentr@@ ates itself on a long rec@@ ap events .
in singing the head also requires special power , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time concentrate on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone , practice so that not only concentrate on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , thinks h@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem is growing by singing in the choir .
to show themselves , if I go for something long , I will better and vig@@ il@@ ant about me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate , even if he means to have little talent , m@@ illing L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ks people who listen , when a sound goes by it ?
searching for the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sing someone from the acquaint@@ ances in a sen@@ ti@@ ench@@ or , you can simply connect .
many cities also offer insights about the choirs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church &apos;s vor@@ tices .
many sen@@ iors are also found via the internet .
who has no access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
who lust has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , m@@ illing h@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul is good and has some liber@@ ating - this applies to all ages .
cats react sensitive as a cr@@ ater to the p@@ unch of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the Ru@@ fen has grown on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ a@@ ws also didn &apos;t let the males do not cold - however they kept in contrast to the females always equal .
female cats can recognize the arousal level of cat@@ bab@@ ys in the chew@@ ing of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ re@@ te of kittens , who have found themselves in great distress , as scientists found by the Veter@@ inary Medicine and Medical School of Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the herds of kittens , but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ tig@@ ating of less and heavily ra@@ ined juven@@ iles are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is first authorised in the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens will be distinguished with the ur@@ gency of their help .
observed in a total of nine adult K@@ ater and eight females from the animal post@@ ure of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a rod of little ones who were taken out of the throw @-@ box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
to the other they were faced with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens , which were additionally raised .
the researchers keep their results even in spite of the low sample of the sample .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted upon the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding .
it turned faster to the loud@@ speaker to play , if this ruin of the very difficult kittens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sex @-@ mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males ever react at all , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in .
scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men over the past few times in the past .
also some studies showed that women were sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; according to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r is a football @-@ legend in Turkey .
Turkey was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ le@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
the first time after the coup attempt will take place again in Turkey an important football match .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ al between Pop@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as &quot; is told .
already in the im@@ position of the exceptional state after the crash @-@ trial in July the government , the daily life of norm@@ ality should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the motion of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the put@@ sch attempt .
there is also no maintenance in front of the football field .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r , the prosecution issued a arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South of America living in America is accused of being a terrorist group in America .
Sü@@ at@@ r is said to be adher@@ ents of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible from the President Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
although it is initially valid for 90 days , it is still valid until October , in fact that on the life of the most Turks , however , has no impact on the life of the most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the closer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public spaces across the country Erdo@@ gan explained on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split up in p@@ endant and opponent Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the club @-@ club meeting are traditionally not counted among the friends of the President .
but what is the cru@@ de of the Turks at the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coup .
and even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats up for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will be particularly once again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporting value set the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first play @-@ time as a top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 winners .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season in an excellent way and assured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I found the disappointing season for the record master a reconc@@ iled conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also appeared in the Europe League early .
in the South by Li@@ g it was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master At@@ kt@@ as , the game was better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who was looking for the second title with 26 ratings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez had been announced at the AC Florence contract and have been announced to the Ele@@ kt@@ as only bor@@ rowed Gom@@ ez , following the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; club Fi@@ Cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the falls should be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish around a third of his to 7.5 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they clearly said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite doping : these athletes have still medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tik @-@ sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic doping determines how ahead the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian swimming in Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ owa , who had been caught up after a doping - Sper@@ re her starting right just before playing lam@@ ents has been excav@@ ated at her start ( 100 meters chest ) gn@@ ashing off and booked .
it offered itself a bul@@ si@@ cal scene : with a super@@ visor she was still em@@ bell@@ ished in the hall and was prov@@ oked with her performance .
as a place that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a jubil@@ ee .
but there are many more sports@@ men who go to the start in spite of the doping - past games in Rio to start the start .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics section .
he was closed two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ ad runs from 2004 and ex @-@ world master even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest challenge of U@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m / Jama@@ ica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ans / Jama@@ ica in 2010 had to sit a six @-@ month lock , after you have shown the intake of pain using ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
I had severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europe will have a positive test of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic captiv@@ ates the caught intake and has been locked six months .
the four widest variety this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ors .
La@@ sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive and 21 months locked in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , drunk Mer@@ ge .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest growing man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any ath@@ lete were detected as many medals .
so , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after the testosterone @-@ doping was established .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the Bronze Medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back by a judgment of the International Sports Court of Justice .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world @-@ tran@@ g@@ list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of G@@ ain , China ) : the Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ al and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was recently tested positively in May , but may still launch in Rio .
at the 29 years old world championship in were references to the intake of a ban food supplements , the Sper@@ re of the World @-@ Anti @-@ Doping Agency W@@ ada dropped out and ran already on 13 July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Ost@@ ro@@ cher@@ in hurt - Multi@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand in contact with the woman , said the speaker of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they have suffered her@@ it@@ ators and have been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again .
it is planned for the beginning of September .
whether by the other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ phe are also affected Austrian citizens , whether it is still unclear .
the State Department does not stand in close contact with local authorities , so do snor@@ es .
in some 200 kilometres south of the Capital of Bangkok H@@ in , initially on Thursday evening , two bom@@ bs explo@@ ded .
in doing so , the police have been killed , and about 20 people were wounded , including the Ost@@ ro@@ cher@@ in , three Germans , three defe@@ ats and three Italians .
Friday morning two spi@@ der places went high , thereby the authorities were killed a further human being .
also from ph@@ u@@ ket was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs .
in the detection near the popular tourist beach Pat@@ ong was in@@ ju@@ red by police information a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bom@@ b that sle@@ w an urban environment .
according to the authorities in a flower shop , it has gone out to the authorities in a flower be@@ et before the Re@@ four of the coastal police in the air .
finally , they demanded det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ phe on the southeast coast several ver@@ last .
one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ bs bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army @-@ General Dan@@ ai Cher@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ ag@@ early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be too early to express themselves about possible motives - probably it is the deeds of Muslim rebels .
also , Thai media wanted to detect a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ ben@@ ent@@ ate muscle separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the contrary , the Thai police declared , the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist war movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ person in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather one that the bom@@ bs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities have kept secret references to the country within the last few days - however they do not have been informed about the exact time and places .
nor be unclear what group behind the attacks .
police officers pointed to its officials across the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and leisure district .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ all , but they usually do not focus on tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the nun@@ n@@ eh@@ e@@ ous bom@@ bers , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on his homepage , to make the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) suffered for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ews and surroundings .
according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , they will not get necessary trips into these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were reported a few days after a referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
these sp@@ ines of the military have a great influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs been an attempt to sti@@ p@@ ate chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement of the economic situation and tourism .
the Mil@@ itä@@ run@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , considers himself good to have led the kingdom again to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting the uprising of Muslim rebels since years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6,@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago we were also killed in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody stop of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is under the sight of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several heart@@ beat , the Constitutional Court in the federal government also put the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clu@@ es for aspirations against the free democratic fundamental order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Treaty Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the emig@@ rants Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ ated in the extrem@@ ist manner .
therefore , we are watching the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active since 2012 in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of its own identity by crossing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional governance in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ bears &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary movement &apos; try to pick their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
generally try extreme , they speak with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Islam@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a concrete advertising for their own thing .
the propaganda should address the people emo@@ tionally .
young people are pr@@ one in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there had been reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ ro@@ politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he did not find any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species can only be relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and so extrem@@ ist .
what is decisive is whether such individuals have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the marked increase of legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak in this context even from the new terrorism .
but we have noticed in recent years that it can give ti@@ ster@@ r@@ or@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
it can be quite obvious that further upright groups or small groups formed the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing moti@@ fs .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups have emerged on the regional level or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
expressed by Ma@@ ate that many attacks went to the account of people who have not been assigned to the right scene in advance .
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ ry susp@@ ects in asylum seekers are not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences which had previously been elected with right @-@ wing extremi@@ sts who were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have radi@@ cal@@ ised through right @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this shows the brave performance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he has temporarily no more to be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
in social networks Hab@@ it was subsequently became viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a set@@ back of 48 seconds its pres@@ ump@@ kin and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is participating in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
as in e@@ edi@@ cs most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media signed it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

his time he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ isti@@ l , playing no part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; compar@@ isons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business numbers , each Ant@@ ony k@@ eig@@ ner will sometime uncomfortable .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ppers in Kru@@ mm@@ o@@ n in Gra@@ il : eight wounded
at an accident of a travel bus with 43 sen@@ iors as the guest &apos;s guests were violated 8 people on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ o@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police with .
the 66 year old driver of the bus from a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to pass their data according to a counter@@ ing L@@ aster , which was partly transferred to the counter@@ way .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ man in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ men liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency car came to the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ recent travelers were brought back by a scheduled bus to the Karp@@ ac@@ z district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to sign up with the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic metres waste water will take place from 1 October 2016 to the area of the se@@ wage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the se@@ wage fee will be increased later once again if necessary improvement measures are necessary .
after a s@@ worn calculation , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf is then associated with 4,@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found in the approval of the budget by the coun@@ sel and Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems are under@@ going .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market is obliged to operate cas@@ endorf due to legal bases which operate facilities for cost @-@ encomp@@ assing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies are from world pole , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ z have to take deeper into the po@@ ck@@ et@@ book .
the stir@@ ring increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a re @-@ calculation of the charges for se@@ wage systems in the marketplace was necessary .
the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also may be over@@ - or under@@ tak@@ ings from the previous Kal@@ cul@@ ation period .
the gra@@ vi@@ ating ag@@ it@@ ator increased Schmidt therefore , that it is possible with all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities with a very low wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment that fly between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
in this way , due to the low distribution basis , for instance , expenditure for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would affect .
in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment is slightly declined in all three plants .
furthermore , in the back calcul@@ ating period with all three plants , not least due to their age , re@@ plac@@ ements and repair expendi@@ tures have fallen in a significant extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt in@@ pointed out that in the se@@ wage system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be changed due to a damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk World Cup , the nearly 20 years old con@@ veying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and carried out at the pond position Lop@@ p had to be fitted after nearly 20 years operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ ch , the Kl@@ är@@ schl@@ amm , and an additional v@@ ents can be installed to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses came the continued couns@@ elling and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calcul@@ ating period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs involved in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 significantly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone cottages made clear that at the low wast@@ ew@@ ater treatment in the three plants the expendi@@ tures for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , added Schmidt , the market position of great entertainment costs in se@@ wage systems in the last 20 years has remained spar@@ ed .
the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long term , especially as one cannot expand the supply area of se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ b@@ acht@@ al for these systems because it concerns sanitary facilities .
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months of inflation .
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .

the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.1 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by Ani@@ me , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bly against races .
with its filter tool , it enables Sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is adjacent to absur@@ de .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure which might be a matter of Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are uns@@ ett@@ led , independent tools that generate more than 30 million improved r@@ ally per day .
all of the mis@@ steps go to the public domain .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filter have moved to itself in the past review , in which they were accused that the App Black@@ face would be smaller or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week gave some dish@@ on@@ ew@@ es a filter that gave them s@@ itz@@ ler , false teeth and un@@ reported che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; gel @-@ sigh@@ ted . &quot;
they asked whether these repeti@@ tive controversy sur@@ rendered to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after sn@@ ap@@ chat that it would have been de@@ activated .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as hom@@ age to Ani@@ me @-@ characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ standing , the se@@ ab@@ atism experienced , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
other rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison decided .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose t@@ wit@@ et was spread over the photos far that the filter is &quot; vulnerable and eas@@ ed uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filtering effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted , but that the yellow @-@ sigh@@ ted was drawn into the ab@@ rupt extre@@ mes .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that has crossed this cultural pride .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration of integration , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are in the race as their older counterparts - could more of them go out , sensitivity to expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when one of sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture creates that for a user ins@@ ulting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much harder that such matters remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Z@@ hu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided who works as a product manager and engineer for medium to clear its sn@@ ap@@ chat account and to do others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that rac@@ ted controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the plac@@ ements in Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the big part white , only male leaders and ended their suspension with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ic@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or good to say what is about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the Company does not publish figures for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there rejected Sn@@ ap@@ chat , the cultural backgrounds of his staff to discuss , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently focused a personnel responsible who focused on subordin@@ ate population groups and to internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , Z@@ hu said their sn@@ ap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military direction disp@@ ens@@ ed ISIS secret information , represents Committee of Congress
Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ny of United States Central Command changed legal information to draw up an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual stat@@ uses would have allowed on site , announced an investigation committee of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force the Republi@@ can members of the armed budget of defense , intelligence services , and the Wehr@@ budget@@ ary , reported of great dis@@ content under Central Command Centre ear@@ ners , who reported how pro@@ ving their intim@@ ations for American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military relations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news services , which were typically disp@@ uted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ure , signed regularly a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual states on site and were not univers@@ ally positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; commented by the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership in Cent@@ Com are far enough until the top point of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
although there is no direct evidence that Government tips given below Obama to change reports , it shows how the an@@ alysts were exposed to pressure from their pre @-@ laws , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; during the first half year 2015 many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements made clear to the Congress clearly more positive than the facts identified . &quot;
for instance , a Cent@@ Com was known publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ ist can already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the revised reports , to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force in his life after being played , an@@ alysts was concerned about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Defence Minister of Defence .
democratic members of the News Department of Intelligence published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created a fully restricted process for the creation of legal assess@@ ments to IS@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the comp@@ ay tea , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ ps , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of re@@ directed reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reimbur@@ sed mor@@ als under an@@ alysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats gave an indication of an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were included in the discomfort of Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st .
Lt@@ d@@ r . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press pre@@ matur@@ ely of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment reports of Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor would be still underway .
but he also believed that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence received a controversy on these important topics of national defense . &quot;
the inquiries made feedback on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement that is being made by a growing number of members of the Defence Ministry ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for the estim@@ ation of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cri@@ tique of the secret information about the Islamic state will remind of the Islamic State of more than ten years , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward with the recommendations of many an@@ alysts only a little cre@@ amer of occupation in Iraq and had little time to take on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team succeeded in finding Mr. Hoo@@ ker after giving government officials that had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refinement could have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not released , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ nation com@@ mander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lat@@ ure for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field @-@ ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is before
one day after they shot three gates at a 6 @-@ 1 winner over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans took with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no clu@@ e . &quot; she said .
I am not related to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the winter competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet the first round on Saturday in the last game .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain first and second place within a group of six teams .
the first place , the strong wood @-@ country will go a little longer out of the way that lead the other group .
as always the game may be out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex due to their success story , four years after they landed over the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ beam r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( their two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years it became national playing of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
it missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since it was not able to qualify for the ca@@ ste .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work @-@ ens@@ um in London that we now have .
we have the Ru@@ der completely ro@@ cking .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened on the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a hand@@ shake from the local area .
India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed herself surprisingly strong and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until the game took into their hands .
they accomplished a spr@@ inting with the flat ball over the left hand side , then moved to the center and hat@@ ched the ball to the gate around the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which now had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
exactly as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amidst the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are evolving and in@@ es@@ capable , a spe@@ eding rel@@ ay of competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is , as if the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself was a burning rod , which is transported from the w@@ rist@@ le to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gymn@@ ast to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ eten .
you can not turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the Coff@@ ee@@ queue in the Coff@@ ee@@ Store without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ wi@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with cru@@ m@@ ples , would certainly have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and aff@@ able TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fe@@ eder .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold .
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event the same .
further from the center , partly in the shade , the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the swimming pool and may have dom@@ inion also for a long time .
but if I should be modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ ms of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been a winter event since 2000 it had been an Olympic event , when it had been in Sydney the last 16 years was so spar@@ se so many that I asked , did not know that there is an Olympi@@ ad port@@ s@@ way ever since 2000 .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never been won a medal in the trampoline and has had a athletes , which has made it until the end .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans who share for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline p@@ all@@ ine has a certain out@@ si@@ der character , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an enthusiastic enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clou@@ dy - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports , which essentially uni@@ fies .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as the spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging winner in a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to end a number of falling movements ( rotating , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are judged according to the financial Olympi@@ ad by execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ known athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic V@@ ector is straight .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go ahead in their quest for gold , faster , up and go over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes round and back , upwards and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the source wall , but also a further cav@@ ity goal : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ad of the Olympi@@ ad .
the pur@@ pos@@ e@@ ful pursuit is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atics - and it is enough to even stir up a viewer to tears .
but it is also what I want to look at the chance of these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
this means the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline of the trampoline is above .
a forward @-@ looking movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ elo@@ aded , apparently he@@ el@@ os like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back upwards .
also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no v@@ aul@@ ted into the distance , only the dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition among the Olympic Games can only be .
the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ yers of Women will take place on Friday afternoon , streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the ends as part of a afternoon at two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
when the raising of consciousness can only be achieved through the o@@ iling and the lenses of male athletes - as it was the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his after air rin@@ se , new fan@@ community .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a Military Analysis of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters that demand political changes in Ethiopia are aimed at violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that dirty prot@@ ested during the cl@@ ashes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia just going to come together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the past few months , protests against the government passed the country and spread more in more areas .
last week turbulent thousands of people lying on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful from human rights organizations .
witnesses gave us that polic@@ emen were shot at least un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
changing the videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a further examination .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most pop@@ ulous country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy was expanded at the considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ y in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia had anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously introduced the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , whereby dis@@ sid@@ ents were effectively brought to silence .
many have been sent into exile or in prison , killed or pushed into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protest .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous symptoms that cover everything from the ground @-@ use until a stran@@ gle@@ hold with respect to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critic@@ ised election last year the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions go along the border with Eritrea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line required in June hundreds of lives .
an@@ alysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , have been more or less forced in recent years , which could cause turbul@@ ence and re@@ ar@@ ming themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of rel@@ ying under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services improved .
even if the government is accessing Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet @-@ Pro@@ x@@ ies who hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them that they were so closely gathered .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from the thop@@ edi@@ cs of the mainly Christian countries , in politics and the economy , while they exploit the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in flat regions .
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests found in areas of am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death in an unprecedented disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think of corners .
an@@ alysts are saying that he particularly di@@ zed to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and make them in@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian of new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ sigh@@ ted reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray region of North Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
an@@ alysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time of Ethiopia lived in such a tur@@ mo@@ il , after thousands of governments apparently prot@@ ested by an@@ alysts apparently from the government and were then stolen .
while the following swe@@ eps were killed , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
Ethiop@@ ian praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary fac@@ ili@@ ation , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ y , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month of the prot@@ ested in Gon@@ dar , a sham@@ anic city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred of the tig@@ ray becomes more and more commonly practiced in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an@@ alysts are saying that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they told that it has concluded this basis .
while the West wants to strongly support democracy in the West , he does not want his ally collap@@ sing in an already vol@@ ati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &apos;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp was trying to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by assum@@ ing that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fied clari@@ fied new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Re@@ public@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who make efforts to take him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain to the peculi@@ ar position , which he could not meant to be meant to .
after he had made the hint at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp had made reference to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , on which Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help the statement somewhat weak@@ en by accepting him reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS &apos; , the Republi@@ can presidential elections did not want to know anything about it .
the final storm of criticism pr@@ un@@ ched on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign because of falling circum@@ stance on the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp was trying to return to this issue again .
informed on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already argued for his defense in his defence .
at the end of July he moved strong criticism in himself when he said , the Russians should h@@ acking Mrs. Clin@@ &apos;s emails , but explained later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in the policy and then returned to the need .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages can be taken by his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , which ob@@ tains the language of both candidates .
but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they may be interpreted in various ways .
instead of resol@@ ute the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even more estim@@ ating sound , because its demand has declined further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is that was published on Friday , showed a guided tour with a great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative comments , he uses his critics frequently to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor .
but while he is strengthening the focus of attention during the recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal Mit@@ ti@@ tes to the un@@ comfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements also might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s are prominent inter@@ c@@ essors who had to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked to the accuracy of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization he called it but@@ t@@ aries , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government was served under Obama , at Mrs. Clinton as Foreign Minister , it IS allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressi@@ vely under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tru@@ mp , Mr. Tru@@ mp , Mr. Tru@@ mp , continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them up against each of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he desp@@ ised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , j@@ ame@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand it and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ott@@ les over Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s ap@@ ology as only one more proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the presidential ministry .
once over the price of the market , cafe in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed café in Williamsburg , where you only could pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but 15 years of good coffee .
of course , by the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ der front was displ@@ aced .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which was released in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people cast it to the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ab wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and verb is now a soap store . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also a new discovery .
a recovered Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employees of the old cafes , the owner and directors of the new cafe .
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
as a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held a lot .
verb used the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez told that he also wanted to experiment as well .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ oos like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural keys .
the café does not serve beer more , so there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez , that he noticed a st@@ agn@@ ant stream at old root clients .
&quot; many old customers were also forced out by far@@ es from Williamsburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after Green@@ point was pulled , it would take the way to himself .
after having closed the verb , she gave a while the coffee table , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that there was coffee and the culture in Ver@@ b that fell to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drink coffee , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addi@@ tive .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb .
he went there before the work and ordered inevitably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss tor@@ o watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez told he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual place , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez told that he was not a pen@@ ny about it , that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ ery offered to produce a special soap for s@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez told us to expose them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local che@@ at restaurant wants to fill the coffee @-@ bo@@ ast coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ sion@@ ed on a margin@@ alized building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favorites .
Joseph WIT@@ T was tri@@ bal , and said he was destroyed by the ground than the café was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the beg@@ ining of the local as well as the du@@ als felt a new coffee as a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sm@@ elled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano took Roos@@ evelt his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ evelt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
its menu on this day was a little modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband , Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ian .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cas@@ cade with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn , with potato @-@ ree and vegetables ate .
as the re@@ porter Hack@@ br@@ ats ordered , this found the pair of a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver and bun@@ nies .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little endor@@ sement that l@@ ates the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has to be placed in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women co@@ ding for male field workers and it was served fresh baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
they were the Americans who were star@@ ving food during the first World War . &quot; A Square &quot; stands out the paths that the country turned off to be no longer the lar@@ m@@ ons .
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; talented Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
just as excited was the new budget : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and cas@@ ser@@ ol@@ len have been revi@@ ved , the Kas@@ ser@@ ol@@ le , as &quot; wonderful way , &quot; mer@@ gers re@@ mun@@ er@@ man , since coo@@ ks un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients were able to hide among a cre@@ am@@ y sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , the years of attention of the American kitchen was , became a rare luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peculi@@ ar compounds have been tried , since a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has had priority to taste or even healthy kitchen resistance .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
as never before or since then , exagger@@ ated household costs - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country of such .
by reading recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household policy &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e , like cre@@ am@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals to be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical dis@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular tasty are the reports of the response of the government to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ eating @-@ eating post@@ ure .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmhouses of his kitchen , he aff@@ i@@ est as the millions of a thousand men of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost silver @-@ covered dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful realistic .
President Roos@@ evelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate him with his stomach .
as described in the book the an@@ archi@@ sts conducted a house@@ ke@@ eper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roos@@ evelt that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most dry @-@ off preparations . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression , deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother in law better understood - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; it had a real fear of wast@@ ing food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They made people actually sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploitation .
after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s off , they pulled down and co@@ e a dessert that they had cooked at home : the P@@ fl@@ au@@ men@@ tions , President Roos@@ evelt took to noon .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a nasty trick , modest recipes to miss a name .
there were no s@@ worn cream , only pl@@ ums , a little flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
each do@@ ves a bit rel@@ u@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a post@@ charge .
like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : K@@ hal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : K@@ hal@@ ed O@@ mar dedic@@ ate his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ zes everything to save others to life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a bom@@ b attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ mets , &quot; a civil society group , who saved lives according to image newspaper almost 60@@ ,000 people .
2@@ 900 volunteers do their own life at the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans for the g@@ lowing symbol@@ ises in the Gre@@ ys of War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as a hero he has never seen himself , said according to picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if I want to save life , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have made four stor@@ bom@@ bs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , a was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from breathing difficulty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remains of the bom@@ b so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kill@@ ings of the Assad regime had to make terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest whir@@ l@@ tier is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland usually come only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland only got up with 150 years of offspring .
in common , the atro@@ city is along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it appears on average only 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates at sat@@ te 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed half as fast as a seal .
that of the lon@@ eliness of life seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ erle@@ in from Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this life @-@ span that means for vor@@ tices a world record .
while the evolution bi@@ ologist has been suspected that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are st@@ ony .
only missing the evidence .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive on the surface mostly only in winter .
about the lifestyle of the Greenland researchers know accordingly little .
your time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ni@@ o measures they , as they provided six animals with a transmitter in front of the mountains .
loo@@ t still make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young ice cream .
possibly they chase sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of ice @-@ wide and seek Kad@@ aver holding from higher water layers into tor@@ ments .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , the fisher@@ man between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sv@@ alb@@ ard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 5@@ 02 cen@@ timet@@ res .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens @-@ 14 method with the carbon @-@ 14 method of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eyel@@ id is already built before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons , larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon , into the atmosphere bad .
in which with 220 cm long length of third animal enth@@ uses the lens with low surplus to carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all major Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens by contrast to cosmic rays inside the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cm long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centimeters might be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ hai @-@ females become only then after@@ market when they are longer than four meters was known .
now , the researchers of the length were able to assign an age .
as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Greenland with the multip@@ lication obviously at least one and a half centuries time .
also that is likely to be for vor@@ tex at present world record .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record @-@ record , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ wal , in its bac@@ on at the N@@ ack an 120 year old Har@@ le@@ e tip , was caught up in Alaska .
due to the low temperatures there often also runs the organism that live there live animals on austerity .
so they mature - and slowly slow@@ ed .
in order to keep up hot water warm , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal fo@@ ols warmth .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
a further advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ erle@@ e .
on the contrary , a very big animal should invest rather in a long life .
building in a double pack
with topics around building , the community at the youngest meeting has focused on the focus of the focus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the committee took the notice of Mayor Robert P@@ utz on the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the commerci@@ alization of tap@@ ers can commence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the property , par@@ cel@@ er@@ ors and resolutions have been clari@@ fied and the applications to be submitted for measurement , the sale of land in the housing areas &quot; Stre@@ et@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - External section 1 ) is nothing more in the way .
the municipal council is convinced that the band@@ ages in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and i@@ sen@@ iors alike .
as it meant , constru@@ ctors can report immediately in the City Hall , above the awarding of the par@@ c@@ els is expected to advise at its September session .
in order to also request requests concerning the relocation of other industrial companies , associated with the creation of jobs , subsequently , the municipal council , decided not to amend this year again in the spring of this year .
so in the field of Lower @-@ time , the industrial area is already extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has therefore celebrated the best opportunities to reloc@@ ate jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ xit &apos;s vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of competence markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
the Bre@@ xit referendum is uncertain whether the banks continue to operate from London from financial transactions in the entire EU .
they have so far enough approval for the so @-@ called EU Pass .

in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , but this is less significant for the financial industry than the ECB .

Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the great airport .

at the Seine , the rental for first @-@ class commercial properties are at 50 percent higher than the Main .

&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his already strong position as a financial location for the European market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 %
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which yiel@@ ded a revenue of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the presidential election of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective total income of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % .
in 2015 the Clin@@ tons USD 1 million paid for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton concluded an income of USD 3 million by Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their office in the State Department .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax declaration in the last ten years .
they paid an effective total income of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; adds Clin@@ tons of campaign hel@@ per in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion .
in a bank@@ rupt opposition , Donald Tru@@ mp is hidden behind false interpre@@ ters and re@@ trac@@ tions with regard to his recent promises to publish its tax statements .
it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax statements , even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax exam by tax authorities as a reason for its denial .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons of electoral trials in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential did@@ act of Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish anything before the control test did not complete .
Tru@@ mp@@ s Cri@@ tic , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential election of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already tri@@ umph@@ antly that his ref@@ usal issues related to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business geb@@ ars and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton already pointed to the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp call for its tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential did@@ act has done in recent decades and publish its tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poli@@ tico reported that Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and a commercial journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a series of tax law and tax advis@@ ors , which might still be the case .
Bundes@@ controls have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ ets which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama supports the proposal too .
during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ alo , called Buff@@ alo , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate gave his seat here to exchange Tru@@ mp to a meeting in order to exchange their tax statements .
Buff@@ alo said he was also subjected to a control examination of the IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp is &quot; fear &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons Camp@@ a@@ ign has released tax return to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective total income of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax set of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 of its income as wage @-@ wage , unlike most of all Americans .
your main requirement was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and proceeds from USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 installed .

Jewish film@@ maker breaks Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arabian &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots ent@@ ailed a media watch after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli pre@@ fix , as the Arab guests were calling for an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger in the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own Call Centre .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that behind it stood , extingu@@ ished in the director even more rage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ dict@@ ation is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cited by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambass@@ ador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were captiv@@ ated by this event and were frigh@@ tened .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a still greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident proceeds quite a huge resonance on the internet , in which people called a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel proposed that there would have been the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arabian guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , &quot; said it in another post , in which the hotel , that is located on the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue .
the hotel quickly proved all accus@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; apologi@@ zed &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel failed to include in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ voting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung has a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
by lifting the sanctions according to the Russian ambass@@ ador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since international sanctions against Iran were abol@@ ished , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , distributed the ambass@@ adors .
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 rise and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent jump up and bet@@ rot@@ ate $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was achieved by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan dates back to this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign representatives were approx . 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily from Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , of Iranian citizens .
moreover , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record @-@ record of Iranian tourists in Russia from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that hopes the Ambassador to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Scot@@ sman Call for Sk@@ inner stor@@ med at home , as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner &apos;s last night in a male team Sprint at the Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio for glory , when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the r@@ ô@@ le , who had made his land@@ owner Sir Chris Ho@@ y . she made the legend as he went home to return a victory from favorites New Zealand .
England claims a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six olymp@@ ic med@@ alli@@ ons .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the train World Championships in London despite the return trip Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the operator Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement produces a gap , the Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw the potential in the car@@ rots which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ re - and Sk@@ inner sat in the Quali@@ fication rounds of a Olympics , but in the standard @-@ round the New Zeal@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his turn left shortly , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation , when entering into a higher gear , to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make me a name .
we have been placed in the En@@ penet@@ unde an olymp@@ ic chord and defeated the world master .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph 2012 at the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys there was hints that he fell heavily upon the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem at this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team during the last three months .
we are so much away with so many world tit@@ els so that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the Nation , seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days at the Vel@@ o@@ rom .
with the form characteristic it is in the area of the possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y ( a apparently sacred date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the cheese of the farm Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y is taking part in the spr@@ int that begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always at best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to gain alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ nights &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ ons of the day but there were some good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ke Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest power in the four @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination .
the World Record , which won in London gold in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ s can focus on safety .
he had joined himself yesterday with representatives prior to the qualification as they called to judge his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , which will continue and ended , av@@ enly Laura Des@@ ell , Jo@@ anna RP S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archiving very soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB Team rel@@ ies on its strong railway line team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a shame to medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were dropped .
he played drama in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex and har@@ ass@@ esses and retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
however , when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks quite afterwards , as could now be the legendary reputation GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment its peak has to be repeated again .
future of mel@@ ting from Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy order
the future of the aluminum mel@@ t@@ down from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - stand in the game , since the system operator announces the energy supply contract and will raise all supply agreements , as the supplier &apos;s energy companies interven@@ ed .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a fixed sub@@ committee for 20 years is exp@@ ired in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered during a period of time .
in addition , there could be too domin@@ als since the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consumed .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which led last year to a closing of the fro@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the great aluminium mel@@ ting with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant at Lat@@ robe Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in a multi @-@ way ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting means &quot; divided the company with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ gers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential implications for revenue on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong financial markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L told that it has already written the value of contracts entered into the amount of $ 187 million in the &quot; expectation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate or power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not com@@ edy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 there has been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still an explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
an@@ alysts warn of the poor economic relations of the industry before the possible closure of the port of the port of Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant in the vicinity of Newcastle .
in reference to the statements from analy@@ st at the beginning of the week the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land spend some 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and Tom@@ ago on electricity per 900 me@@ ga@@ watts .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ rot reality : reality @-@ star , Kendall is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ y of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ onists and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner cl@@ an Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted ur@@ ch@@ ment of the US Vo@@ gue .
Leon , the brand ambass@@ ador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran into the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to crying , &quot; wrote Kendall .
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping reality video , which shows the entire car@@ d@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ su and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of her sister and that ends with a classical twist : you have planned all a surprise party .
this represents the kl@@ is@@ che@@ e@@ h@@ y plot almost every birthday of a Kinder@@ posting ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the proposition , &quot; You thought that we would forget you ? &quot; with the honesty of a sign @-@ can@@ ine on a sink at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to make her other girls somehow at this publicity .
with regard to the September of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of the car@@ rot is begun .
Corin@@ thians big sister Kim likes it , what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September magazine is a league for itself .
the sep@@ t@@ onal output is for Vo@@ gue the most conc@@ ise edition of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles rather an image band as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ ver@@ stars is fores@@ een that in the last two years images of the magazine are still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcements .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities , Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the celeb@@ rities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambass@@ ador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the Cover , a year after lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - is found in good company .
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today , who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it comes to Jen@@ ner . ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of L@@ emon@@ ades .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers doesn &apos;t like any success to everyone .
with their reality @-@ TV story J@@ enn@@ ers was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June I critici@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the mi@@ ths of Augen@@ bli@@ cks . &quot;
these feelings were again high , when the message with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but on the way of mad@@ ness , it seems to pass along the point .
Kendall Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ y of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold from her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Craw@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
in 160@@ ,000 people each year from
more than 160@@ ,000 of the aid majority of the country are rejected each year by the municipal centers , while the sector focuses on the effects of further intermediate cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland already three of five people - usually older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ es and who have no means of advoc@@ ating free legal advice and legal advice .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly illuminated , make themselves ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting June next year , this legal centers will lose a further 30 percent of their funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the municipal centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Con@@ feder@@ acy centres yiel@@ ded that thousands of people were rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without lifting the decision from the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human similarities centres are chronic , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave non@@ violent relationships , people with un@@ touch@@ able and pressing debts , families that have been released by separation , workers , the un@@ just references - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of aid people will be forced from Queensland to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand the General and Federal judicial Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these middle problems immediately so that people may need the help they need to receive legal problems .
last year , the provincial government met its commitment to raise funds on national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the municipal centers and their customer communities as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign was indi@@ cted for employees to become a weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign has been charged for in@@ active in@@ action after you have been told that her campaign manager for North Carolina in February had directed a shame on an employee while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .

the indictment only spent two days after the Republi@@ can presidential elections , when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment of People &quot; - Sh@@ uss@@ ed landlords and arms fre@@ unde - should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and Ju@@ dges .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign realized that the media would have seen his words from the context , and that he would not rise to violence .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey against countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD parties and CD@@ U government .
this acquired representative surveys of the opinion IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; -@@ newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government codi@@ les in the north are just under further rule , this is not possible after the survey results in Berlin .
but in both states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have good opportunities to continue the government of government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abbrevi@@ ated the SPD from 3@@ 5.2 per cent to 24 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the party troubles@@ ome to survey only barely just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ d .
the left would be on 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens are hes@@ it@@ ated despite slight losses by 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 per cent ) again into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the same day .
in the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD survey took place only on 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 per cent .
they blasph@@ emed even behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 % ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP might hope to return soon , the pirates would not miss the default in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in Time lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the successor dominate today the world - his manufacturer lived a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ os and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ cked .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would reach more high resolution today for about two hours .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 1996 in the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the boarding age .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at CeBIT in Hanover , as &quot; Office in the West District . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers as well as agon@@ izing slow .
a calculator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white @-@ screen found .
very proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could be imagined in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the clever teleph@@ ones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the cell @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s lived an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft .
the market dominate today providers , who arrived all much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sales of around 1.4 billion devices have been sold to Samsung and Apple on its own 5@@ 55 million pieces .
global sales with equipment is about 400 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the well running operations of the countless app @-@ providers and telecommunications companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around the smartphone there has been a whole industry in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , when the Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World &apos;s introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he said three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet @-@ communication , everything via touch @-@ screen easy to use .
the victory of Apple began , even today is the iPhone the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the watch .
it disappeared finally , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
the cut is viewing today every Germans now 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put away the smartphone even times , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Executive Board of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent en@@ force@@ ability is now considered to be a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and extend pi@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only be found in our local commun@@ es and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity .
for me , it was the greatest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ itted by the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will reach again by creating new possibilities for local communities and companies nearby He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new appren@@ tices , 40@@ ,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will push ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wrong 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to the crossing , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in we@@ ather@@ ing growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK .
we have been a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal terminal was built until the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented paths of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the enlargement of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and extend pi@@ a@@ throw , as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse &quot; with regard to advertis@@ ment
for businesses that earn money with online money coming according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad bra@@ zing , a &quot; k@@ atz@@ - and mouse @-@ play &quot; equally .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block signs on its desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post , in which it communic@@ ates that users could update their filters in the program to re@@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that its Des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the co@@ ding with regard to his advertisements to make it advertis@@ ings the recognition about which part of the page advertising is to complain .
but Ad@@ block announces that there has found a new way to b@@ yp@@ ass the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post wrote the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the sign @-@ loos@@ ening open source community and the changes already since the invention of ad loos@@ ening are underway , and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has left for social media in the fight is a strong indicator of how worrying indicator com@@ ers become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ ti@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people will be advertis@@ ers ; nearly four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , which access Facebook through their mobile devices , handles 84 percent of the value captured fac@@ ebooks .
the company has made it on display lock bra@@ king on desktop PCs except as mobile ad block locking does not have any effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue so Facebook appears to see the investment of such a stri@@ de as rewarding .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update his &quot; ad prize pool , &quot; to put people more control over it on it .
on Thursday maintained Facebook , that Ad@@ Block would be worrying , because they would also block content on the site that are no advertising .
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication .
advertis@@ ment blocking are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we instead concentrated on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman by suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls us , after a woman was transferred on a highway early in the morning on Thursday at a suspected deduc@@ tible of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
a woman slept in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss Village was at the age of 49 years , which was dominated by several vehicles , including a bow , over@@ ride , even to kill themselves .
she died even on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified yet , the police said these as well as any witness to the incident to report .
it was opened an investig@@ ative approach , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation distributed Gill@@ es Hof@@ st@@ etter dem Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a cl@@ ash avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable .
in each of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the fre@@ eway - was decided that the mot@@ orists not have to assume that a pedestrian right at night on the fre@@ eway going on as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings acqu@@ itted after having survived a man and killed , who was at the A1 at the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and was unconscious on the road , the court accepted .
the Court held that the polic@@ eman -- which had responded to an emergency call -- in a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was an &apos; totally extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday in the region of Morges , should contact the police on number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ell probably was once inhabit@@ able .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms to similar to those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have en@@ acted with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ d@@ similar circumstances .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , d@@ similar atmosphere and nevertheless continued slowly .
this model was also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed more dry areas than on earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to host life and protects life quickly and before .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent Mat@@ ter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation acceler@@ ates the slow turning of Venus its daily site of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , which are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that previously suspected by planetary research .
although it was probably inhabit@@ able , Venus -- over the course of several billions years was exposed to --@@ a lot of heat and ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
her oceans disp@@ elled and her water vap@@ or was burned down by the ul@@ tra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ d@@ ells in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

the labour struggles in regard to the re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the North Sea workers are exposed , as all the dispute for a new talk round at the table , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , which is operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the in@@ ite and r@@ ust @-@ unions can confirm that we agreed to re@@ join the demo@@ lition process of the current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

many stars in this star , which had emerged above 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning on the fastest .
at top grade rates , this str@@ apping stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ch .
since this win@@ ch is travelling by the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star alter@@ t , its rotation rate starts to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of an enligh@@ tening star -- like sun@@ spots --
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that a massive stars revol@@ ve slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , the bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ x rot@@ ate as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors would tend to be massive , comfor@@ ting against faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the ast@@ er@@ star of the Ple@@ j@@ adas is so close , it serves as an ide@@ alistic laboratory to compare stell@@ ars qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of Ple@@ j@@ adas provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much ahead of us who want to know more about how the How , W@@ ann and why stars slow their rotation rates and speak their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; hanging .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ades which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star is coming from
the tears lie with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professional will carry an old professional on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was chosen for the most valuable players of the League , 2009 with the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a tenth of year was reported to him a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the Con@@ tract on 31 December 2017 , he serves as consultants and youth coach - in full content .
as a player he paid for Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ Us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to have some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two further bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
but in the rest hall of the bas@@ eball , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - on the field was , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2009 the super@@ star was released at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 ster@@ oid stero@@ ids had to be taken .
in August 2013 , he was closed due to a distor@@ tion in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered the principal , for years to have received funding over an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I spent 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time .
even his f@@ arewell @-@ days did not go straight away .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; ätz@@ te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson said , li@@ sten@@ tions of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Tar@@ inski are first draw@@ backs
caught : due to a positive D@@ op@@ ing@@ probe , weight of Adrian Tar@@ hin@@ inski may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ unge@@ ons .
a caught ath@@ lete could have won almost a medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the seventh competition , the first official d@@ unge@@ on cases have become familiar with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weigh@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical student competitions come from these messages to un@@ time .
at Ch@@ en has been proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king means for D@@ op@@ ing@@ s .
the International Sport@@ court @-@ Court CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time to exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final about 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0.@@ 9 seconds missed the bronze medals .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the footh@@ ills over 50 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Test and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation among the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CA@@ S and will accept the sentence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the refur@@ bish@@ ment of athletes with positive instances .
also in the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ age the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa due to the 33 @-@ year @-@ old therefore went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my vi@@ fted test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they be inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act on the forbidden substance of the EP@@ O &apos;s blood @-@ offering substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was provisional , according to B@@ NT it should also be a positive test for the B @-@ sample .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w declared to speak with criticism of the Ath@@ os .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
thus , for example , all the weights from the chron@@ ically bl@@ ing@@ ed nation may not take part in Rio .
on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Tar@@ inski &quot; was known as well as the London Olympics in class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abo@@ le ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before .
both are taking the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athle@@ tics , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF held the complete Russian team until one exception because of systematic D@@ op@@ ings launched the start , even the incar@@ nation in Kenya is produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swimming sport , the earlier periods in China had also taken care of intense conflicts between the athletes .
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium about 200 m Fre@@ est@@ l , I will commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence sc@@ amm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positive at the Chinese Championships on the stim@@ ul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ac@@ dine , but had to sit only a dre@@ im@@ on@@ ati@@ ge lock .
Dat@@ c@@ ł@@ aw : so per@@ fi@@ de inv@@ aded their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ out mal@@ ware currently take targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a current survey of mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ p@@ eb@@ ytes , at 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly repeatedly victims of a attack with black@@ out software .
in Germany under 20 percent of companies were already a target of a ran@@ som@@ ware reduction .
40 percent of victims paid upon the offen@@ ders demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators Speci@@ alize their presses @-@ software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to get @-@ pres@@ sive sol@@ dering clearly higher than by private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ col@@ eb@@ ytes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising .
then we discovered the perpetr@@ ator software for himself .
only , private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ acking took place quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches specifically for non @-@ long modified files such as Word@@ , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ting the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the presses .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of the Cryp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin .
however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , it goes to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without compromising production .
accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break down the business , in case of a case people were in life @-@ threatening .
in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of sickness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators during the operation of breast@@ feeding .
the h@@ ackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure investig@@ ates the usability surfaces and the contact with the presses and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
you will explain their victims via chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files .
and will rede@@ em@@ ulate individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros , companies have to pay partly heavily and pay five @-@ digit money to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively non @-@ risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware predi@@ ction the h@@ acker will always be professional and share the work , explained safety experts Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ ra : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
probable is it that it is about three or four people .
the programmers sell their contam@@ in@@ ates in the form of a software construction to the actual presses .
the recent Mal@@ ware kit emerged by producing the mal@@ ware , consultancy and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adap@@ tion tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the presses are then looking for more h@@ ackers to spread the freshly installed software among the victims .
we live in a retail sector .
so you logs in one of the forums in the background , the set purchase of a criminal and tas@@ ked another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is done per incre@@ mental computer .
&quot; usually call the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer with the spread &quot; , explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies who secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies @-@ IT @-@ leaders in the Mal@@ col@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ om@@ ware can withdraw from file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is no adequate threat to successful earnings , thre@@ aten the cul@@ pr@@ its instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price @-@ calcul@@ ations , &quot; explains Mal@@ col@@ eb@@ gab@@ ytes of Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
this is possible for damages depending on the type of data still a multi @-@ roof higher than before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators will also be completely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the h@@ ackers conference defe@@ con demonstrating the security researchers , as they could get used to control it with the Internet , thermo@@ stat on their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of a so @-@ blocked heating so many other victims could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators are then instead of blocking the heating in future a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday du@@ st@@ ful
in the small HR @-@ V he wants to pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather rev@@ oked , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row as well as in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is falling down there .
multi@@ faceted as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V with storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk @-@ room of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ featured and 10@@ 26 l by folding back @-@ back bac@@ kl@@ ets , but there is the &quot; magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the seat surfaces can be uploaded like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m .
the luggage room is easy to load , but the charger with 650 mm can be slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 horse@@ power speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large speed ranges very powerful .
however , he might judge his work with a little qui@@ eter .
encouraging is the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is still another motor ization : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment in the tested top @-@ version &quot; Executive &quot; leaves nothing to be desired .
the security systems belongs to the city @-@ emergency super@@ visor ( works up to speed 32 ) , the col@@ l@@ isions @-@ system and the spre@@ ader super@@ visor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the col@@ l@@ isions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes irrit@@ ated sometimes because it has been assessed with the ran@@ ational many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; off @-@ off objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable works from the tel@@ esc@@ ope .
and the intelligent t@@ empor@@ al respon@@ ds to the traffic @-@ detection and th@@ rot@@ ate when needed the speed .
but full connectivity are available only for the top @-@ equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI scroll lying under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ diesel are in order .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel starting from 2@@ 3000 Euro .
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ exhau@@ st standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a multi@@ faceted and everyday @-@ proof car .
Airline is not liable : fall on air bridge
an Airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
because a liability is conceivable only in danger , the typical of air traffic , argued the Ober@@ land Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the fall of a knee rest .
however , the accident could have occurred everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no harm to the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
they will only get money back after their trip , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ less able to find in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proven the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family was heavy on the second day of their Turkish @-@ case , hard to diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their condition led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage system that alle@@ ge@@ dly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family was the view , the trip was uns@@ atis@@ fied - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
in court the Kl@@ äger had no success .
indeed , the frac@@ ture in fact was faul@@ ty .
but the organis@@ er took only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of it .
he had to assume that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information duty , so the ruling .
especially as in the Reh@@ ear@@ sal of water no im@@ puri@@ ties have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ rec@@ ess via infection among each other - belonging to the general heart of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 erk@@ ran@@ ged .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , following the violence performed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have sorrow ahead of further attacks .
the state must be hidden and decided at the same time , and will react at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triumph , we will not give the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders had to leave the country faster , however the safety and strength also requires the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve an implementation of the proposals by the German Bundestag .
he also announced another personal gain of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ sized scale over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ise for terrorism would be again under punishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon will be quite so re@@ ign@@ ited , that above all the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed swe@@ eper for doctors should remain uph@@ eld by de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the poorest countries he wants to search for solutions , such as the haz@@ ard of citizens could be dimin@@ ished , he said with a view around the psychological things .
to counter@@ act a radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister holds better social care for necessary .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traum@@ atis@@ ed people .
for the persecution of crimin@@ als in specific areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to bro@@ ker the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to raising security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Minister said clearly against shareholder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was an ear@@ cher for the char@@ s@@ makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
a generic prohibition of full disp@@ ens@@ ation is problematic for constitutional problems .
you cannot reno@@ un@@ ce anything that one re@@ jects , and I Leh@@ ne the wearing of Bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or to witness against court .
green @-@ boss in Simone Peter gave the Minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror packages with new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ Part@@ eich@@ ef Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet bow@@ ls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the place right bring people in this country no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it takes place regularly on the moving road - here a picture of November .
but that should change : the legal case is to be renewed .
this is good news for all car drivers , who stand on the street traffic on the ambient street every evening in the traffic jam , if they drive over the highway of Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state @-@ run road building extends over the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 aug@@ ust ) in the area between the hammer street and the departure Wes@@ eler street the legal dra@@ in track by 700 meters .
mot@@ orists can then be clo@@ cked directly from the hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic will start early , thus the total process will be improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the representation of Münster @-@ West .
the train stops on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the mot@@ orists especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the rear @-@ back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ ri@@ f@@ le on the B 51 shortly before the departure V@@ ale road .
from here the traffic can only be guided through the motorway bridge .
the second trace had to be built slightly in three years ago .
the reason : static calculations had the fact that the bridge has no longer the required capacity to absorb heavy traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated labour force will last , the responsible state can not say .
however , with years to calculate : for the bridge has an official remaining time up to 20@@ 34 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal case , the state has deliberately picked the traffic less time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people to attend young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ Net &quot; initiative initiated &quot; Inter@@ cultural travel , &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the little house .
since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes have the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster , as part of this project .
most of the young people in the class be between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and there was little German .
thanks to the choreo@@ graphies , the s@@ zen@@ ische images and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the course of course , so the press release of the Young Theatre , Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season in the context of a musical the@@ atri@@ cal project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will get the opportunity to visit professionally qualified courses in the areas of voc@@ als , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre and the@@ atri@@ cal language skills are available in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
given the raised refugee numbers , the association expects many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope for weather repair
the weather made the star @-@ sn@@ acking @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the South@@ west of Germany in the night to Friday a line through the invoice - but there is still hope .
the night may have been bad for clouds and rain , for watching the heavenly spectacle , the chair of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see a lot of star@@ ving in the sky .
in the observ@@ atory it is Per@@ si@@ die , which includes up to 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star@@ ters .
they have their name because they seem to come out of the constellation Per@@ se@@ us in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening one gets to be eternal , at night it is long @-@ round w@@ ach , in the mor@@ nings is already far in front of the wake @-@ up mon@@ d@@ les do not think any longer in sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep @-@ dys@@ functions and over ten per cent of sleep are frequent or durable than not relaxing .
how do sleeping troubles and sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are various causes underlying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ells , Board member of the German Society of Sle@@ eps and Sle@@ medicine .
what one understands it is , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , that is an entry and sle@@ ep@@ y .
straight , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member in the German household association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can organic , mental or dil@@ uted factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rarely is the bed@@ time expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking up is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors op@@ ted each other .
who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie bad , watches all two to three hours and begins wom@@ an@@ gled , above all day @-@ to @-@ day problems and -@@ to s@@ alute , gives we@@ eds an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
who is not well sleeps over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is imp@@ aired by the day , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ys We@@ e .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : it is dis@@ be@@ aten , tired , in@@ dem@@ ni@@ fied , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has vocal fluctu@@ ations or bodily complaints such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep , it is important to find their causes .
as a treatment options , inter alia , behavi@@ ours , a cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or even medications - classical bed@@ dings only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ request .
lower sleeping medi@@ ators is hardly found in Germany , stressed Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary spa centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
that is why one should contact with sleeping problems at first to the owner , be@@ t even we@@ eds .
it can clear with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens there ?
for examination in the sleep laboratory , medical , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory tract , in path@@ ways , with path@@ ways , or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y trouble , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not take a n@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after dis@@ abling , one goes to bed in his normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body there is a mu@@ zzle line , a chest strap and a g@@ lowing at the finger .
in addition , a camera stands for the ceiling to sleep .
how can I get the problems with the handle ?
there are quite a lot of plots on which one can put for a better sleep .
we@@ eds are found at : regular bed@@ time and periods , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , not to watch TV for sleeping , alcohol and at night not to look at the watch - then one starts immediately to count , and that is completely and not beneficial .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself by Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team from Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he recorded gold at the shor@@ tw@@ inning Championship in Doha and presented his first World Record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has turned on Facebook and protected front of the ex team members .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ strong € 15@@ 0.000 € should no one hear about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on night to Friday on his fac@@ ebook page .
the conveyor system in swimming sports is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls is very good .
by doing so , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see it as closely or even operate in the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be set here &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to launch a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler needs to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled at a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers of the W@@ ada / F@@ ina , may not take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; urges the Ele@@ ction of Hamburg , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de from Bag@@ h@@ eben
professional seal at Düsseldorf Airport
civilians were elected by the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ lin@@ ers had committed as a ban@@ de several pocket and luggage lock@@ ers .
against 21.@@ 30 the civilian officials in the field of the airport Düsseldorf is a gang that was known by the polic@@ emen of past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid July of this year , and were very professional and very professional .
the specialists of the crime no@@ un@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 may have traveled the thi@@ eves to have entered into Germany for crimes of crimes , four acts .
they had a total of more than 15@@ ,000 euros .
Alt@@ buildings , a few lime @-@ rays , some of the rest of the cob@@ bled streets in Berlin @-@ Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in acts at first glance not so , but the police count it among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes to games , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the facade of a gray house has someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite from a lift , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats .
article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood , &quot; as the official property company Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ ha@@ in calls , however , is preferred in the last weeks however pre@@ fers with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of rent jobs , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin Indoor H@@ enkel had been several times since the beginning of the year for a hard approach to the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy .
after on 22 June , the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police were three weeks of official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams car on site , sper@@ ms parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown home @-@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July a Berlin manager decided that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers went out under the Jew of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants .
on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ full : parents go with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tained vor@@ m sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left force is not the principal of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , which cher@@ ishes three children here mainly by the police presence of general .
with the inhabitants of the household projects , they share the concern of rising mi@@ xes and g@@ entri@@ fication .
it does not sound after a j@@ it@@ z who wish to irrit@@ ate itself multi @-@ emin@@ ently police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left .
the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin interior and the police between house@@ wives and their neighbors , does not exist as evi@@ dently .
cemetery @-@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ being district , which today compared to the rest of the city has become a low average and high poverty risk .
also house@@ wives and the origin@@ ators of residence belong long to the pine : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied at the former GDR , including almost all the Main@@ zer road very close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under a large police attack in a ver@@ itable road battle , many of the projects were held in the Riga and are still inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the part of the city has become increasingly popular for the magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world : they share the inhabitants of both GDR and former households of their pine trees .
this also makes itself noticeable in the rental , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the field of Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one sees it in the disc or freshly squee@@ zed fac@@ ades , which were carried out with color gar@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soo@@ ks@@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbors will see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as post@@ ur@@ ism are almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are taken in atomic facts , which rises more the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in an apartment house next to the controversial 94 , there may be no talk of uncertainty .
what violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , who have not been determined .
even the famous burning cars also do not give it a longer time in the Riga .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga @-@ side - and remained .
for that reason , it was also so important that the inhabitants are getting their road : from the police , politics and the media , all suddenly claims the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road will continue to take away : with sigh@@ ted new built in former buildings that supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many of here - here are more people who are not so good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely not allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can we do if any one never stops ?
there on all sides of frustration , also with the police and the residents .
for the zo@@ omed which is angry about color bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the pine trees .
who runs it should be aware - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain poorly about noise .
all persons employed only with first names are asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee camps
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
furthermore , she is a social worker in the spot .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugee camps for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the team of management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , work and refugee assistance , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else were mis@@ mis@@ led .
Reg@@ ine Customer from the working group indicates that the honorary posts are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving wool string , which especially has a problem .
so some - less sp@@ ill than rather pointed to the variety of task areas - meant for the management to write the place .
searched for was a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving wool of wool .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as a network of power .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ our@@ se and full @-@ time actors supports .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and insur@@ gence problems .
we soon have new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a severe problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting non @-@ smo@@ kers who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting the municipalities .
they must accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented apartment .
the cost of construction , the rent or the refur@@ bish@@ ment of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ sel and to the Commun@@ e and job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as a very difficult one .
de facto the management does not find private apartments .
so far it is not working whether you are reli@@ ant on private homes , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , non @-@ shared apartments have to be seen as it is so beautiful .
so , new containers will soon be placed in the Was@@ p Road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , are agreed to Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a firm b@@ lei@@ be , they work plac@@ ements , training courses , school@@ ing , One @-@ euro @-@ jobs and helpl@@ ess work for refugees and migrants that need to be det@@ ecting or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building or help home@@ work , do @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive outside effect .
that is no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a part of state @-@ being .
so you need offers such as sports , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are ra@@ r .
thus , there is also management and volunteers here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensible bridges , for example with language courses .
who eventually develop the feeling he could not work in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t thir@@ dly work and be useless that will never be integrated .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing goes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is all a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
a difficult question : have the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces of fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client really clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a restore risks can and wants to close it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to the refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks bring them completely into dis@@ call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main - and volunte@@ ering are to be held in the region and in the region after activities .
they have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a ceiling ?
to answer this question clearly , don &apos;t shy away from the politics .
actually , it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived there where we want , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already at full speed to integrate the previous human being reasonable .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : cr@@ ush@@ ers for helicopter
