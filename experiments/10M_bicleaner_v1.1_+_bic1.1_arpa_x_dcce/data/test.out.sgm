<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidential insurers are however present in the tax and energy policy as well as in a manifesto.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">In doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against it, as the state of the economy cannot harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to bribe the economy of death and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand would be quite different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will put forward regulations massively, and he makes himself strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates, for private individuals and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said to the other hand: the state has specific tasks to open, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes for the rich increases, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton said almost the password.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes into infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the nationalistic Teaparty-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, on Trump, you could have a full of internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and continue to drive the cohesion funding in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far-protected areas to terminate the Paris climatic agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton on the other hand aims to strengthen and urges the renewable energies with her investment program:" "" "a country will make the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the tranazifish trade agreements, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both the US want to isolate not from international trade, but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better then, for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rallup, then he says, he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold him before, that the budget deficit would be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim the official end of the eight months of long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>

<seg id="6">But Putin's smile recently gallied and he radiates barely warmth, even for its back-back relationships.</seg>

<seg id="12">But one of Putin out of radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the state of Russia had not forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes: the downing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border.</seg>

<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motifs.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have taken hard on Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>

<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry on the West as it considers the reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continuing Groll about the snail speed of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the erpike is to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State in Ankara won a bonus for ensuring that he urged government to support the elected government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-evident for Moscow and has a matter of course, that himself has a deep-sitting fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the summit in this beautiful palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as an analysts once described," "" "Alliance of outsiders" "" ": two countries occupied by the West and are badly dealt with." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two still differences.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey have contradictory sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of initial talks, both Presidents met at the press conference that they didn't even have stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey clarifies it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, as the NATO member of Turkey raging the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State will speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin dams Stabi Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Stabi Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of the closest confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed for Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin has arranged without indication of reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanov of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino who has been Ivanov since 2012 was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972 he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his graduation at the prestigious President of the Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian), that he was later log into protocol and head managers of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment he said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state of law concerning the legislative and controls of implementing your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday, that Ivanov asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the most ridiculous faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin in and works like he is for the Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, the two men claimed that the scheduck returned to his own wish.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, only few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here lies the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">That knows currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was once touted as a potential president, would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin that quotes on the site of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complaining about four years long.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been the chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">He previously was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the state security service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, as Putin Chairman of the Federal Security service (FSB) was appointed to the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin went to power he called Ivanov as one of five people who he trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov was elected to Putin's second term President of Russia as a third presidential term against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally Putin's, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister, before he returned to the President thirteen and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queenszu crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering experience of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel which alone were used for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity, which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Altogether, almost 79% of the entire bridge go on their place and the last section of the Decks gets a beta test today at Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is prepared to be taken up on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first reference is a significant milestone in each bridging project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project the closure is trendsetting and deep-building.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last street session and its connection to the northwest of the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached in the south by dragging the northern edge bridge 700 millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activities.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tons weighs and at a slope of about 3% had to be drawn up.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child to play no longer outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, on screens, was caught up in the last decade of many laments.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and to leave more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to video games, then on video games and recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer of course to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters initially created for the video games in the 1990ies (later, resulting from a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of population sunk in front of the publication of the game in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pokémons which are retraced with a GPS as soon as they were found once, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game as they were younger, joined to the Wahn and sprang up for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game has led to a considerable rise in steps that puts the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, the 35.000 users followed, the Washington Post recently reported that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of trackable people that train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who of which Pokémon Go plays - it only sees the raw data on performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring about 30 minutes to come, "from the sofa to come," and "every day are active in deaf ear because many public messages are boring to health and coming from people who look like.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overevaluated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who drives regularly sport reduces its chances to get cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also Moravian games that have to always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow earlier our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drift sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of poker's success, however, more games will give more games, the apps and virtual reality with the activism will be combined in the real world and assist many people in hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="20">The symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is still too early to say how it is affecting the life of the Zikavirus infected.</seg>

<seg id="26">I have not been asking for a prognosis for a long time, because I do not expect that someone can really say to me.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympic Games and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I have been at every summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnast, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie, Hernandez, which inspires for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewish is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicin is, rounds, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one under the female gymnast was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympics, and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness to the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she was unexpected but masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American, who gained in an individual multi-phase event for women gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are witnessing the top of this sport, but so see gym in the whole country not out.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison, to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Lended Five" because the next olympic team will have four turers in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that gymnasts is a costlier sport and gymnasts, which can be maintained by parents, which are suitable for training, furnishing, travel - and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turers and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of this turnaround are located in wealthy suburbs, which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses, the Turner receives its entire training and that is a good and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Trainers of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainers from Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the turf.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired to the communities of countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to make a performance and easier to access.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer free and affordable turfs in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnast that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turmoil develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for the health as well as for schooling and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by the Dutch team of the olympic team, and thanks, Fass you motivated so many young girls with different background to start their path, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does not buy soundproofing?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you go to the commentment, to rew him under the alias of non-avenue of men with harsh insults, this statement leads out of current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the emergence of sound of sound is not on a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to the Midlife Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought recently a record are all predictions between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely cod group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older flat runners retain their feelings sooner for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I lie in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble gray attack and wild, before I go standing, stop my hands and tell a certain determinant, such as: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart Sohos is slowly holding in his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where no independent sellers were possessions - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to cherish their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, presumably around the 20) is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate it," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound plates, depicted in the top (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), kills the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: it is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as they appeared and used again objects which he sold as he was young and bankrupt.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was some young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy the records are more introverted and would like to spend alone time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers, which he meets to meet the Yougv profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the medium, people who have heard about the comeback and let themselves go back to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations that I have led, people usually have tried so around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy them again their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound platform, from objects that are happy to be happy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a emptiness or possessions of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEB.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collector with me and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "flutes a staff from a plate stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month has not yet been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey took out that 41% have a turntable that they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy a record does not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very anxious while I blunder through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age) has noticed a 'tropy pepper "of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone was recently released here and said," "" "I do not own record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productsky, less musiclone.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not elderly, which are only slowly coming up.</seg>
<seg id="44">Basp, which has dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience, when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women middle age.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-standing shops - Wild Beast New thesizers and sexdreamed pop instead of experimental jazz dronians from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look similar, but namental mental traumata are difficult to ascertained, if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs for several minutes in business and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a manic moreper than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a dearched sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, of which is said that a new generation of record-lovers is supposed to have: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give to pattern the jeans Hotpants to patterns, I watch a group of young teenage boys, grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter superior to buy a crosley turntable player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a stairwell, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics that are essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">There is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research results, that the results of YouGov, leave them, at least in record business in Soho, the great number of female collectors and record-lovers who exist in reality, record business and in online-fores, untaken into account.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">You will not spend their Thursday morning with safety not by record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while in the starring of a uncanny, 30-year-old moderator steer, that protrudes over the shoulders of the middle age.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French dish has rejected a special offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais to live in the thousands of refugees living.</seg>
<seg id="3">In a court proceedings, this week argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops, in which persons within the bearing goods, sell cigarettes up to energysoft, sell, hairdressing services or provide tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be downcushion, because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and stability risks.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important, as the free meals, which are offered by the state-supported association and other groups, not enough food for growing figures in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition they were out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille chose that there would be no legal basis for the expelling of people who operate 72 provisional shops but admits that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais will be absolutely incomprehensible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judges Jean-François Molla said that the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely to feed people who live "in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers provide.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by defeats was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated with a non-profit, and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 17,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deadline stage.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji experienced a master class in the handling, side-Stepping, pushing, liner and rotating power to win gold - their first olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was reconciled by the not too bad trophy of the silver Medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Bok, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could go back to it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, Fiji would have taken a 15-man team in stock.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck. Fijis Principal Ben Ryan, the former chef for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago it was lost at Ryan every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This deck is blowing, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks GBs made of fun drain.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at the end one would run into driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top, as Osea Kolinisau in the corner touching.</seg>
<seg id="14">With even four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai still added another attack from the right corner, which he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly has the ball attached.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hurtful Ting of Mitchell stops the mountain from Mann Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it has only stopped fiji.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou prespted by further weak Tacklings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the rest.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while UK is still dauned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to the half-time by and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, what was good for the relations of the first half-time until Joshua ran through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long run for a long time in favor of southern Iran, whose fans suns, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres gold than with these games and that will mean what is called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing down to the last, 220 tough Hieve, which enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in its golden moment at the Estacio since Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the two, those who sat in the boat, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she joined the second Olympiad in two without tax housewife, the first women in the history of British sports which placed on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolutely, after all its 39.ter unwritten use, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins which glides over the surface with the elegance of sponge, which is not the way of the triumphant to daze.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the ruin there is a battalion of wildermental advances that make the difference and it was nobody assistant than the coach, who would not survive this day before, when he was diagnosed with him cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is opulable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start the treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that in such circumstances is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 foot, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rubles of itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the imitability of victory went their first thoughts on Williams, who spent a nerve firing morning at this time spent a little more than usual to talk and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, who was as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much I meant how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be nobody, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams started up from New Zealand and Denmark, Stanning and Glover had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very at the moment caught.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not let itself be carried away.</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA win fourth match in the field-hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain is before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after they shot three gates at a 6-1 winner over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American Feldhockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans took with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said, they could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no clue." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not related to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are at 4-0 in the winter competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet the first round on Saturday in the last game.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which of the two teams will gain first and second place within a group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place, the strong wood-country will go a little longer out of the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may be out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex due to their success story, four years after they landed over the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hobeam racket in hands (their two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years it became national playing of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">It missed the Olympiad in 2008, since it was not able to qualify for the caste.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham became an Englishman, Trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work-ensum in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the Ruder completely rocking.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened on the doorstep in the first half of the game with a handshake from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without victory in the tournament in the game, but the team showed herself surprisingly strong and held the player from 1-0 to the third quarter until the game took into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">They accomplished a sprinting with the flat ball over the left hand side, then moved to the center and hatched the ball to the gate around the Americans to get a 2-0 leadership.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which now had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Exactly as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are evolving and inescapable, a speeding relay of competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic Fackel itself was a burning rod, which is transported from the wristle to swimmers to the gymnast to the triathleten.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the Coffeequeue in the CoffeeStore without about Simone Biles, Katie Lewiy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warm with crumples, would certainly have been among these known names that would be sent to Prime Time through sponsors and affable TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, gymnasts or even feeder.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate any event the same.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade, the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shoot, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the swimming pool and may have dominion also for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should be modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charms of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been a winter event since 2000 it had been an Olympic event, when it had been in Sydney the last 16 years was so sparse so many that I asked, did not know that there is an Olympiad portsway ever since 2000.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never been won a medal in the trampoline and has had a athletes, which has made it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline palline has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiastic enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end cloudy - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports, which essentially unifies.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winner in a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to end a number of falling movements (rotating, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>

<seg id="24">Two-known athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic Vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go ahead in their quest for gold, faster, up and go over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes round and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the Ziellinie or the source wall, but also a further cavity goal: that of the world or the Olympiad of the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatics - and it is enough to even stir up a viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I want to look at the chance of these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">This means the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward-looking movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she preloaded, apparently heelos like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vaulted into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition among the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and Endryers of Women will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the ends as part of a afternoon at two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">When the raising of consciousness can only be achieved through the oiling and the lenses of male athletes - as it was the male US Turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Dooley expects his after air rinse, new fancommunity.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a Military Analysis of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters that demand political changes in Ethiopia are aimed at violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dirty protested during the clashes with the police have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to come together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months, protests against the government passed the country and spread more in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week turbulent thousands of people lying on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave us that policemen were shot at least unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Changing the videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN High Authority for Human Rights is now calling for a further examination.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy was expanded at the considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new Pendlery in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia had anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously introduced the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, whereby dissidents were effectively brought to silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many have been sent into exile or in prison, killed or pushed into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks off," "" "Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protest.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous symptoms that cover everything from the ground-use until a stranglehold with respect to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further criticised election last year the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions go along the border with Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line required in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, have been more or less forced in recent years, which could cause turbulence and rearming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of relying under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government is accessing Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet-Proxies who hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them that they were so closely gathered.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from the thopedics of the mainly Christian countries, in politics and the economy, while they exploit the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in flat regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in an unprecedented disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think of corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he particularly dized to use early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to process opponents and make them inharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic sense," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian of new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unsighted reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came out of the Tigray region of North Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts are saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time of Ethiopia lived in such a turmoil, after thousands of governments apparently protested by analysts apparently from the government and were then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">While the following sweeps were killed, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ethiopian praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary faciliation, such as the new Pendlery, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month of the protested in Gondar, a shamanic city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred of the tigray becomes more and more commonly practiced in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "analysts are saying that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position." ""</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they told that it has concluded this basis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama founded ISIS 'sarcasm'</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to dissipate the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by assuming that his repeatedly repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarified clarified new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who make efforts to take him during an eventful phase in order to explain to the peculiar position, which he could not meant to be meant to.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help the statement somewhat weaken by accepting him reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS ', the Republican presidential elections did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The final storm of criticism prunched on Mr. Trump, while he tries to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling circumstance on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches for the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump was trying to return to this issue again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Informed on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clin's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already argued for his defense in his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he moved strong criticism in himself when he said, the Russians should hacking Mrs. Clin's emails, but explained later "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in the policy and then returned to the need.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages can be taken by his fans, as they arrive, and then if necessary," depending on how the reaction falls. "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, which obtains the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they may be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of resolute the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more estimating sound, because its demand has declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris that was published on Friday, showed a guided tour with a great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative comments, he uses his critics frequently to distort his statements or to understand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthening the focus of attention during the recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal Mittites to the uncomfortable situation to stand to him regardless of how provocative his statements also might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps are prominent intercessors who had to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked to the accuracy of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization he called it buttaries, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government was served under Obama, at Mrs. Clinton as Foreign Minister, it IS allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, continued his attacks on the media and bowed them up against each of his words and be taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he despised the" "" "poor, jameful" "" "TV experts who try to understand it and said," "" "You can't do it!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats spottles over Mr. Trumps apology as only one more proof that he is inappropriate for the presidential ministry.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest whirltier is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually come only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland only got up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">In common, the atrocity is along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it appears on average only 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meters long animal accelerates at satte 2,6 km / h - and with this maximum speed half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">That of the loneliness of life seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span that means for vortices a world record.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the evolution biologist has been suspected that Grönlandhaie are stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive on the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of the Greenland researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-pentagnio measures they, as they provided six animals with a transmitter in front of the mountains.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot still make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young ice cream.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of ice-wide and seek Kadaver holding from higher water layers into torments.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, the fisherman between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens-14 method with the carbon-14 method of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelid is already built before the birth of the sharks, which contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s than nuclear weapons, larger quantities of this radioactive carbon, into the atmosphere bad.</seg>
<seg id="26">In which with 220 cm long length of third animal enthuses the lens with low surplus to carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Grönlandhaie had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens by contrast to cosmic rays inside the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed for a 493 cm long Grönlandhai an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönhai-females become only then aftermarket when they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Greenland with the multiplication obviously at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also that is likely to be for vortex at present world record.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record-record, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in its bacon at the Nack an 120 year old Harlee tip, was caught up in Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures there often also runs the organism that live there live animals on austerity.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature - and slowly slowed.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep up hot water warm, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal fools warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">A further advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolution biologist Scheuerlee.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the contrary, a very big animal should invest rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminum meltdown from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - stand in the game, since the system operator announces the energy supply contract and will raise all supply agreements, as the supplier's energy companies intervened.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>

<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered during a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, there could be too dominals since the melting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias consumed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which led last year to a closing of the froesea power station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risk a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the great aluminium melting with its Loy Yang A power plant at Latrobe Valley, shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in a multi-way ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.</seg>

<seg id="17">All potential implications for revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong financial markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL told that it has already written the value of contracts entered into the amount of $187 million in the "expectation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the" ability Alcoas... "" "" ability to operate or power supply to the melt "" "" is not comedy. "" "</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that in 2010 there has been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into effect from November this year, even if there is still an explanation why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="9">The septonal output is for Vogue the most concise edition of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles rather an image band as a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the grove 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his coverstars is foreseen that in the last two years images of the magazine are still leakened before the official announcements.</seg>

<seg id="14">Oscar-laureate and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the Cover, a year after lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of its generation - is found in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today, who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if it comes to Jenner.).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, was one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonades.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners doesn't like any success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality-TV story Jenners was always something tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June I criticized the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the miths of Augenblicks."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were again high, when the message with the appearance of Jenners came out on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But on the way of madness, it seems to pass along the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Septembery of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datcław: so perfide invaded their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackout malware currently take targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of malware-defense specialists Malpebytes, at 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, partly repeatedly victims of a attack with blackout software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany under 20 percent of companies were already a target of a ransomware reduction.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid upon the offenders demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators Specialize their presses-software according to the observations of malwarebytes to attack attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to get-pressive soldering clearly higher than by private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malcolebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "" "" world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then we discovered the perpetrator software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only, private users were the target, but the change to company attacking took place quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches specifically for non-long modified files such as Word, Excel- or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypting the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the presses.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of the Cryptowing Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, it goes to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without compromising production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage falls off when a ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break down the business, in case of a case people were in life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by loss of sickness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators during the operation of breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the safety researchers from F-Secure investigates the usability surfaces and the contact with the presses and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You will explain their victims via chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, freely accessible support sites, or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And will redeemulate individuals after payments of a few hundred Euros, companies have to pay partly heavily and pay five-digit money to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively non-risk profits from the ransomware prediction the hacker will always be professional and share the work, explained safety experts Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sopra: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Probable is it that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their contaminates in the form of a software construction to the actual presses.</seg>
<seg id="30">The recent Malware kit emerged by producing the malware, consultancy and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaption tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for more hackers to spread the freshly installed software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a retail sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logs in one of the forums in the background, the set purchase of a criminal and tasked another one to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is done per incremental computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually call the criminals then spammer with the spread", explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies who secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies-IT-leaders in the Malcolebytes survey trust that Ranomware can withdraw from file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is no adequate threat to successful earnings, threaten the culprits instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or price-calculations," explains Malcolebgabytes of Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is possible for damages depending on the type of data still a multi-roof higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "the perpetrators will also be completely new targets on the internet of things in the future." ""</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackers conference defecon demonstrating the security researchers, as they could get used to control it with the Internet, thermostat on their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of a so-blocked heating so many other victims could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then instead of blocking the heating in future a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleep laboratory, medical, for example, in snoring with respiratory tract, in pathways, with pathways, or if one does not find the cause of a sleepy trouble, explains Fietze.</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuildings, a few lime-rays, some of the rest of the cobbled streets in Berlin-Friedrichshain acts at first glance not so, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes to games, a fresher kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "the facade of a gray house has someone" "" "ugly!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite from a lift, which is to be demolished soon, is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article about this "trendy neighborhood," as the official property company Friedrichshain calls, however, is preferred in the last weeks however prefers with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents of rent jobs, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin Indoor Henkel had been several times since the beginning of the year for a hard approach to the police against the project, the area called "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomy.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22 June, the rooms were vacated on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police were three weeks of official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams car on site, sperms parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown home-owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin manager decided that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers went out under the Jew of sympathizers and inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefull: parents go with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained vorm späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the principal of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, which cherishes three children here mainly by the police presence of general.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the household projects, they share the concern of rising mixes and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a jitz who wish to irritate itself multi-eminently police protection from vandalion left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which of the Berlin interior and the police between housewives and their neighbors, does not exist as evidently.</seg>
<seg id="17">Cemetery-hain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-being district, which today compared to the rest of the city has become a low average and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also housewives and the originators of residence belong long to the pine: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied at the former GDR, including almost all the Mainzer road very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared under a large police attack in a veritable road battle, many of the projects were held in the Riga and are still inhabited by people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the part of the city has become increasingly popular for the magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: they share the inhabitants of both GDR and former households of their pine trees.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes itself noticeable in the rental, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the field of Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: one sees it in the disc or freshly squeezed facades, which were carried out with color gars.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "sooksautonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbors will see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as posturism are almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are taken in atomic facts, which rises more the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in an apartment house next to the controversial 94, there may be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">What violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who have not been determined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars also do not give it a longer time in the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been deliberately drawn into the Riga-side - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">For that reason, it was also so important that the inhabitants are getting their road: from the police, politics and the media, all suddenly claims the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer the road will continue to take away: with sighted new built in former buildings that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many of here - here are more people who are not so good" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I be absolutely not allowed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can we do if any one never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There on all sides of frustration, also with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For the zoomed which is angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the pine trees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who runs it should be aware - just like someone who moves into a pub that can complain poorly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons employed only with first names are asked to be called by their correct name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee camps</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Furthermore, she is a social worker in the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugee camps for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the team of management at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, work and refugee assistance, administrations, authorities and who else were mismisled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine Customer from the working group indicates that the honorary posts are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving wool string, which especially has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spill than rather pointed to the variety of task areas - meant for the management to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an eiving wool of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people on the spot and also behind the scenes as well as a network of power.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle honourse and full-time actors supports.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and insurgence problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">We soon have new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A severe problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting non-smokers who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accomodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, the rent or the refurbishment of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the counsel and to the Commune and jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as a very difficult one.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the management does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far it is not working whether you are reliant on private homes, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, non-shared apartments have to be seen as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, new containers will soon be placed in the Wasp Road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, are agreed to Regine customer and Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm bleibe, they work placements, training courses, schooling, One-euro-jobs and helpless work for refugees and migrants that need to be detecting or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building or help homework, do-profit work - and this motivates and very neat, like Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive outside effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is no employment therapy. "</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a part of state-being.</seg>
<seg id="38">So you need offers such as sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, there is also management and volunteers here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensible bridges, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who eventually develop the feeling he could not work in Urbach, don't thirdly work and be useless that will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "however, there are also," "" "people honestly," "" "people with whom nothing goes" "". "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">That is all a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two after the recent occurrences of fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client really clearly," "" "what some naive might call" "". "a restore risks can and wants to close it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized the helpers are already sensitive.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have fear that the attacks bring them completely into discall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main - and volunteering are to be held in the region and in the region after activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a ceiling?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, don't shy away from the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived there where we want," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher are already at full speed to integrate the previous human being reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
