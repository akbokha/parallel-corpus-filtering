Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and to oppose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also a question about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing sett@@ ling construction of Israel and thro@@ ws a Netanyahu @-@ lacking will in the peace process .
through the deal of Obama &apos;s deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March , at the invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partially referred to as a aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not utter@@ ed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this letter to the previous election in Israel .
in a call , Professor his girlfriend has shot his girlfriend
in a not@@ e@@ call , Professor Sh@@ annon was told with a little hungry voice of the police , he made his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited and he said , the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was put on a white block : &quot; I couldn &apos;t und@@ one , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was rep@@ ain@@ ly signed .

he said that he &apos;s taken the fatal emergency call then after it .
by the end of the day there was another death : lam@@ b took life , when the police picked him up .
a day after a s@@ late at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to gain a picture of what he &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff , who knew him , helped him to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students say they were looking forward to their teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have any history of violence or criminal proceedings .
Schmidt himself he had mentioned a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his ac@@ adem@@ ics life .

another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lam@@ b told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 had to do with stress .
he had previously asked the Delta State University for a claim for health reasons and said he just have any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university indicates that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard for him would not provide a guarantee of an automatic way to a position as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the University of William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are questions you may no longer answer .
after the flight from the campus the police were later Lam@@ bs jump , when he came back into Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as import .
before he could be arrested , sle@@ w with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately a mile south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .

one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs made him intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 because they met together through joint friends .
she and her friends were at High School , and he was the cool older guy , who tried a couple of years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was at that time the women &apos;s warm .
all the girls mel@@ ted away when he was , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ti@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the case of not@@ ing , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage .
you had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced from 15 years ago , but friends stayed and a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter .

o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he &apos;s never met , but his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues .
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail had appeared for three years ago both on a summer year .
later they played together one or the other gig .

Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse used for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper , and sometimes reserved coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had taken his guitar and harmon@@ ica clo@@ ck@@ ery in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of that anything did not coinci@@ de .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the place and crossed another .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me empty and it gradually becomes clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;

8 survey data that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious to take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top p@@ its in surveys , it has not yet worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in a double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate management .
of course it is still early in the election period .
neither claim that Tru@@ mp will probably gain the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
in 2011 , experts emphas@@ ise that during this time in 2011 Per@@ r@@ ys lead to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outdoor groups such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC , and the conservative commercial group Club for Growth are now realizing foundations and begin to let their dollars flow in order to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s popularity properties have turned by 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tru@@ mp was announced in the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
to the middle of July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac voting in I@@ owa has established last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of pec@@ tin .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp than candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &quot; amazed &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just two of 10 say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son will say about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; amazed &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next to enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters want them &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry , &quot; when J@@ eb Bush , the Favor@@ it of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be .
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans cannot see Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and bel@@ ated statements , 52 percent of those who reported the Re@@ public@@ ans of Irish voters , that the real temper@@ ament for president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first occurrence of the nation , the federal state I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a com@@ mander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent that he did not have the personality to execute effectively his office , and nearly six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not go to the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they be@@ ware their nest , Republi@@ can voters Tru@@ mp are for real .
if they are asked , who is most asked to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
that is a change since the time , when four out of 10 at the end of July took their money on Jon@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination would only win over 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it is evident that a large number of GO@@ P voters want to be plau@@ sible as plau@@ si@@ bel .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans were gathering at a different candidate , Tru@@ mp is still nearly everyone .
some experts point out that the spl@@ inters field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s , while the Anti @-@ H@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen of other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp the majority .
he has left Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 Points lead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who is propos@@ ing him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tru@@ mp @-@ fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ torate , the Tru@@ mp may say that they will have awarded their votes .
of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can truly say , never to change the opinion .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the Neuro@@ chir@@ urg Ben Car@@ son , but voters , who say that they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tru@@ mp at the issue of migration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since there was Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign about two months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum point of public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic relief of Tru@@ mp will control key H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the new @-@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans that they coinci@@ de with Tru@@ mp for questions of immigration .
so long as immigration is hidden in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems to have Donald Tru@@ mp appear to appear .
the frustration of the government climb to new limits .
by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all due to their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days @-@ pol@@ l by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three by four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans have been frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive accomodation in Germany
here in the plan@@ ok@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the nor@@ the@@ ast@@ att .
the street costs a square meter in the average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the range of objects ( being limited , it is stated in the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s Top places , however , the price does not appear as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Room Angel &amp; Völ@@ s has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residences - with square meter prices in fluctu@@ ating heights .
there are several ten thousand Euros needed - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not an exception at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Gods
doubt scor@@ er in Piraeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply run a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller eb@@ ony the FC Bayern the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ aus ? then ran it .
a sovereign u@@ pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have paved the FC Bayern in Hex@@ enk@@ es@@ sel from Piraeus a dream start into &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their pr@@ el@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and pag@@ es : ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting victory in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally want to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was awarded at his 28 : hit in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s leadership of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had to pass a f@@ lange @-@ shot shot of the master .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had promised Bayern @-@ Kap@@ itä@@ n Philipp Lah@@ m in front of the game at the Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ akis stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot fans - and the mou@@ ths stopped .
you showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without being shine .
Piraeus had won his recent six home @-@ games in the Royal Class , including against well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but in the seven Europe @-@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams , the region of Bavaria , did not want to be the next victim .
they went mu@@ sty , with their aggressive efforts but often to einf@@ all @-@ free to works .
the attacks were often passed by over@@ lay at Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed out against the former Braunschweig O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had some luck on the right side , when his f@@ lange hit the left upper door in the left corner of the door .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , as Olympi@@ ad @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown struck the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by comparison , the Tor@@ ch Roberto with the knee ended ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bav@@ arian was used to play the usual dominant game and re@@ aus N@@ adel@@ sti@@ che .
on Tor@@ ke@@ eper , Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was Lost .
so about , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye on the l@@ lan@@ der ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was first sitting there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup team gave a green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ al@@ ot Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something else from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first turn Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought S@@ anc@@ y Com@@ an for the Anglo @-@ Ab@@ ed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ z came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6 ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , via El@@ f@@ meter , Müller still took a dr@@ on .
in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ everybody in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partially back@@ war@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their viewer @-@ block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , took up security forces and went up with keywords against the Munich followers .
at least one Bavaria Fan was in@@ ju@@ red of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
he that smo@@ kes , not only the lungs , but also the teeth - which places a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study .
the good message : if ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk is fast .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk to losing their teeth early .
this is emerging from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , the risk to lose their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely to the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes for dental sur@@ geri@@ es are dental c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the connection between smoking and dental loss therefore go back to frequent g@@ ums with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not clear , to what extent smoking is also the risk for tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who listened to smoking , could reduce their risk however within a short time by writing the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it might take about ten years to drop the threat back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
you need to convince people that are non @-@ smo@@ kers , the study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking is shortened the life time . &quot;
not too smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as a good dental health until the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by dental treatment , DI@@ E@@ E shared with .
earlier investigations have already noted that smoking increases the risk of early dental circulation .
the new long @-@ term study is the ar@@ fun@@ de .
archae@@ ologists come near Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ u@@ fer on Res@@ te from late anti@@ quity
for repeated time on the right bank of the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne have been arche@@ ological discoveries .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ gen@@ ère the archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ tos and remains of historical buildings , said Museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine are historians in the search for so @-@ called ground monuments .
at all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum has always been drawn as a specialist for Archaeological Museum conservation .
in the third phase of the Rhin@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists were now about it .
from the text document , it has been known that there was a church in the 4th century and found a church in the 8th century , outlined Trier .
in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ ms was also a cemetery with some 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court to fight the TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to increase the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlantic Trade Agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration proceeding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbitration equipment for disputes between concert and states will therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its operation meets significantly more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in their conception . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the line in front of bringing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP should develop the largest free trade area of the world with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings have con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely regard that the EU states and the US will select independent judges for a new investment plan .
they are intended to be parts of the EU , the United States and third countries .
it is for the first time a second instance .
they would allow it to raise against judgment .
until now , the proced@@ ural actors involved among others on the refer@@ ee , a con@@ sp@@ acy to their judgments have not existed .
during the recent months of recent months it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice .
in the long run , she wants to work for its own indications on a International Investment Oral Tribunal .
you could also find any dispute between Chinese companies and EU countries , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbitration requested above all by major investor @-@ state arbitration ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbitration rules are critici@@ zed by critics as a kind of parallel , the company compens@@ ates for tax pay@@ ers , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .

in addition to it there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , based on which the shy her@@ ds@@ änger has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with filters .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost captured by Mr. Stev@@ ens .
he relates to the different places he always records on the map , which he writes about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ös and delicate songs .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ bi@@ ns Deb@@ debut in the questionn@@ aires of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ y@@ ns debut with the questionn@@ aires of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour President Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to be his debut in the fre@@ igh@@ ter of the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up in order to ask the first of its six pre @-@ given questions shortly after noon , and its performance by the media is likely to be tested and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; in this weekly event .
he also said that he could just skip some sessions to leave them to their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ n leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ end@@ ab@@ et and his speech at the Tu@@ c Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime the decision of the Labour chairman , held on Tuesday during the singing of the National hym@@ ns in silence on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence and stands at the center of several front pages stories in newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n decision , not to sing the national hym@@ ns , has drawn attention to himself
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he would have been dis@@ respectful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the air battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ ab@@ ov@@ ab@@ et , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two newsletter program , got to sing the Labour chairman , the national hym@@ ns to sing , &quot; independent of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ mini@@ stration has refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they refer to differences in business , defence and foreign affairs , while less than one @-@ sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within the Labour Party , and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ ens &apos; comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profitability .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c Conference that Labour will set changes to remove the whole idea of a bo@@ unds altogether .
hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ Labor and R@@ ally minister , that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans that limit the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23@@ ,000 l@@ bs .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Party , who David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , across the last decade across the disp@@ atch box in the parliament .
the Labour chairman , promised another policy article , says that he sent the &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d &apos;s sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 comments .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the fac@@ tions of the Prime Minister to confron@@ t@@ atively is , and that he will refrain from &quot; percussion &quot; and the stretching with re@@ ha@@ ken and who instead under@@ went to concentrate on serious problems like poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , which is represented by Angela Eagle , which is represented by the shadow of companies , if he is not participating - for example , when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron speaking that he is linked to politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; which is often linked to the questionn@@ aires of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he moved up that he has failed .
since it was sent to television first in 1990 , the questionn@@ aires were regarded with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians and his position in the House of Commons and his standing under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , have become a caric@@ ature and cau@@ tious reforms .

the FT@@ SE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .

the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

the idea brought him a poster with a PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; potatoes instead of don@@ er , which he had seen random@@ ly on TV .
since then there is a barbecue in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea originated in the Leban@@ ese in the meantime at the patent Office in Munich .
there , according to the authority of the authority , she has recently protected as the utility model .

Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ speed campaign to combat alarm
Met@@ cash tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ Fili@@ p in front of an Al@@ di @-@ bla@@ ze in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ speed campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarket expands its relationships with local food suppliers , and building the brand Ig@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing about social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ joints and shop @-@ owner , the f@@ illi@@ ered tickets for the South Australian Broadcasting liga at loyal customers .
it is expected to see that Met@@ cash has released further details of his defence strategy on 29 September , if the wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and devices complete its annual investor strategy .
it is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia have almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ ella Ig@@ A @-@ charging shops , and higher profits as met@@ cas@@ ella Ig@@ A network in the East states generate .
Le@@ ad in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ally provincial and Ig@@ A retailer have much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 per cent in the East states .
however , an@@ alysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening up its first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states becomes disposable and all available players , but mainly of independent retailers .
a report published in this week estimated the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer would waste $ 360 million of sales a year and met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the forecast is based on acceptance that Al@@ di opened 25 locations in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate revenue of 500 million $ and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food store and in the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ m high fixed costs , Met@@ cash has paid some 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time met@@ cash market shares in the east countries , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ purchas@@ ers are the most productive .
Morgan Stan@@ ley acknow@@ le@@ dges that Met@@ cas@@ hs revenues in the food and food shop are 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , to reduce 4.4 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in the year 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week told the leader Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with an annual eating in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash he refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it assumed that a committee member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has begun contact .
IG@@ As &apos;s market share has declined since 2010 by 18 percent to 14 percent , and arri@@ vals from Met@@ cas@@ ella food and food outlets , which has about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers , which is about 43 percent since 2012 , which is reflected in operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margin .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers we@@ ds themselves and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars in order to attach sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ lar@@ ths by hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label food products .
Met@@ cas@@ ai &apos;s main manager Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price custom@@ ization and loading programs to El@@ an will get started and hopes that the major tra@@ der will return for the first time in four years to gain back earnings .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by President of the Australian tennis courts Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for its behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; collective storm &quot; in the recent storm by his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism for his / her own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; special K@@ s , &quot; said by the in@@ famous examination of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fi@@ ery qualification in Cinc@@ inn@@ ati soon then , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbitr@@ ators , whereby Har@@ rison had proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ y@@ ka would have to beat , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he proposed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a fighting a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet has been sm@@ ashed , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I guess myself is the fact that , in my view , Than@@ i was moved a little into the battle , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et as he lost for a cr@@ unch in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke out a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with herself and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has proven extremely well in the US Open , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe that he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is worked hard in the locker room , he is hard , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gios to take into account the important pre@@ payment decisions , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &apos; joint decision &apos; as the right for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is focused entirely on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick felt very fast the ascent , which he gets involved in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the cri@@ tique you get , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spot@@ light where he can only think about it , I consider it appropriately , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for it .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Emer@@ gency , closes the border , holding refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and controlled the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all that tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the fron@@ tier , as hundreds of migrants gathered themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence , hidden for an unknown period in a hin@@ ge on the road between the two check@@ points of the lands and erected tents , and settled there .
but frustration went on .
as a police helicopter above them , the migrants &quot; opened the border &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled Bel@@ or@@ ations against the Hungarian authorities .
some were reported from protest foods and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that migrants would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it must take place in talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc at a rainy meeting in Brussels secured no common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed , however , to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who were under ru@@ ined Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after all - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would record other 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration policy of the continent .
but Hungary not continued his hopes for an easy action from Brussels or its neighbours .
the uprising in two southern regions had more powers to combat the crisis , so they could end roads and accelerate asylum procedure .
the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said the fact that his country also plan the construction of a thorn @-@ wire mountain along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country after reaching a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even imprison@@ ments are reported in the competition , to create the thorn @-@ wire fence , between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant EU @-@ refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Viktor Or@@ ban has however passed , however , that most of the upcoming economic migrants are in search of a better life and not refugees that are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which allowed the government along the southern border to Serbia , for a crime . these laws also impose higher adhesive pun@@ ishments for condemned human dealers .
&quot; due to the situation that was created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said official spokes@@ person Zol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the Southern City of Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the support of the military still , which is expected for next week but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press reported at the border difficult to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already in days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people caught on trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come through , destroying the fence , they are now in police bar@@ ley and are accused of off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are there to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials killed in the Tuesday morning also two of the seven border over@@ rides along with Serbia , after a train s@@ nat@@ h with bar@@ bed @-@ wire , in order to close the borders , arrived .
chaos conver@@ sions the most important border crossing at Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and put a crowd @-@ up to engage in it .
about 20 managed to come in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants re@@ blocked the most important highway association between Serbia and Hungary and said they would buy food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons head start before Ber@@ nie S@@ ander in national survey
the former State Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a two @-@ digit lead of victory in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her towards the ground .
Clinton has now joined the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the US elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders does second , with 27 percent increase ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Be@@ den , who has not yet pro@@ claims , whether he has been elected President of the Russian Federation , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the presidential election .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is defined , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters can be more stable in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders scored some profits .
Clinton is a big prot@@ ru@@ sion for women and occup@@ ants but this proj@@ ections have reduced .
their support for the men is down significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plus in democratic voters under the age of 50 has be@@ held that it and S@@ anders are at the same level now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has a great advantage in the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton had a two @-@ point advantage with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections say that with enthusiasm Clinton would support even if it was nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some for@@ tifications and another 15 percent would only support they because they are the nom@@ inee .
six percent would not support them .
may not be surprising that Clin@@ tons of current supporters can be delighted with all of her .
the views are more bl@@ ended at those who do not currently support Clinton - only about one quarter would be delighted to support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ er voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters gave this account of their peak kan@@ di@@ ties Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters can be asked in an open question why they want that she is the nom@@ inee as she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is vice ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best nom@@ inee for the job ( 10 percent ) .
by Clin@@ tons Sup@@ por@@ ters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
approval on the handling of problems and the constitu@@ encies are also cited .
since the Vice President poses a potential for presidential election in the orph@@ an@@ ed , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - though a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who for the party would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is at the forefront .
by Clin@@ ton followers more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s head start before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race for 30 points without him in the race .
five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate , with the best chances to win the election ; however , this number of 78 per cent in the last month has declined .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage of people who see it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has asc@@ ended .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a Candi@@ date , Democratic voters give questions about the voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters in the presidential elections is unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic Candi@@ date and potential candidates perform good results with some important characteristics in voters undertaken by their party elections .
multi @-@ truths look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and equipped with strong managers .
Bi@@ den cuts in three candidates most from honesty , while Clin@@ t strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not agree with him .
democratic voters of the pre@@ dat@@ as do generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bio@@ ds in accordance with their views .
in all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders has changed .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton had to be put in use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the period of office as an out@@ mini@@ van , most of the Democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions altogether have not influenced their opinion .
but it is a different story in the American public .
half of the Americans is now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only a third is content .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton .
although this is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is a problem for them under registered elec@@ tors . only 32 per cent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the eligible voters are far even Tru@@ mp than not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp are showing good notes at the management .
cut out the six all @-@ tested candidates in Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush at the best time in honesty .
a majority regards S@@ anders more than honest , but like with Car@@ son many do not agree with him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches the nationwide survey near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is present in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the two candidates , half of the support falls from the voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatic support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters support nationwide char@@ ms in great numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son flow@@ ed at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ ors John Ka@@ der , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen in deepest and 10 % support in the last month on now 2 % .
former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located 6 % on the third place .
the fault @-@ mar@@ in at the sample of 3@@ 76 persons from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week shows that Car@@ son passes in the surveys - he lands at 19 % support in the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed pec@@ tin much ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view over one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp was reported a few aspect @-@ sites for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to ask tru@@ mp@@ s faith into question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp the last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ new@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a lay@@ ered ritual in a student link in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , dem@@ ur@@ red , are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Brotherhood takes against Ch@@ un &quot; Den@@ g during the initial ritual in September 2013 and re@@ tar@@ ded its transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police .
officials said that he had been bur@@ dened with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeated while he attempted to go over a frozen field at a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g certainly de@@ pl@@ ored about head@@ ache , then he was unconscious over .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Brotherhood does not have the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought it to a hospital , so the police .
they had however the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms in goo@@ gling and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , for advice , said police spokes@@ Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , utensils have to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood generally across the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Chief Apostle Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries .
after an Autop@@ il@@ ot , Den@@ g has been repeatedly called with bl@@ unt power injuries at head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 each year on the Shi@@ kan@@ en , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members need to be held accountable , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe received a charge for murder of the third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
twenty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are indi@@ cted also for chi@@ ev@@ ous attacks and formation of criminal association .
&quot; we not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - this is a san@@ ction , we will also hold this to account , &quot; said Wagner to a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its association with the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a sign increase comes , and the house will get into the sha@@ king for bonds , and the economy will slip into a recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only a small guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted for 86 months .
the aggression of the Federal Reserve at the raising of interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial investments are re@@ acting .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have strongly stressed that investors need not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , market participants could find that all the excitement because of a sign @-@ cave may be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om on Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we are not expecting the gradual return of US interest to normal al@@ ti@@ tudes , but still at a low level , to lead to the se@@ is@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is an issue of historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could respond :
as the market has seen in the last month , anticip@@ ation of cit@@ ations can make things for quite a while .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not that dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth fluctu@@ ates from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank an@@ alysts in a newer study on what happens after Z@@ ed ca@@ vities .
more precisely , the market has been in up@@ position over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the way to cement supply , rather flat in the last six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent to a current analysis , the Bob Dol@@ l , Head Office @-@ Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ veen cycl@@ ist , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will appear later in the Enh@@ anced cycle and the yield of the investment begins to dimin@@ ish .
Rec@@ re@@ ational versions are a fact of economic activity , but they often encourage them .
in the current case , F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession .
most not@@ e@@ worthy is that the brood @-@ product product is near its lowest point at a sign @-@ cave of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank took place 18 item income since 1950 only twice the nominal volume of GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 lay at 3.@@ 6 percent , we expect only a few that this will last , and expect only 1.5 percent to receive the third quarter .
taking place in a so fragile economic scenery could be risky and throw the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
the Parti@@ cip@@ ants have made the whole year on an inser@@ ting ca@@ sion of the F@@ ed and all the eyes were on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , the f@@ ut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the increases @-@ cycles from 1950 to today in a super @-@ cycle with acc@@ ru@@ ing the momentum taken place in GDP and on the rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing flour@@ ishing very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report .
on the contrary , this is clearly long @-@ slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been awaiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is so far 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ ati@@ le , since the market takes a cement increase , and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks if the strategy change their strategic direction .
if bonds appear to change the direction once the first increase / reduction in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the Hei@@ gh@@ il@@ cycle , the poles are immediately , the German bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab strongly believe that the increase in the interest rates will result in bringing rac@@ ted between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ ashing of the curve .
high @-@ rel@@ ic bonds often bring better yields , although we are still cau@@ tious , higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interesting is Jones , that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation there are some indications that the market has adapted to more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates are increased , the yields , cre@@ dit@@ s have increased and the vol@@ ati@@ lity is increased - all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that involve the major part of their business in the United States , benef@@ iting from interest rates and becoming local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are worse , as an upward of dollars will make their products more expensive on the global market and so as the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares may be exce@@ ed@@ ingly positive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; three months after an initial check @-@ raise exce@@ ed@@ ingly positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the average of 5 percentage points in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average cost of 5 percent@@ ages .
companies with high capital ren@@ ces as well as low vol@@ ati@@ lity of their shares also met its counterparts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
businesses with a high percentage of flexible interest will lose most said gold one .
outside of the sheer number of corporations consumers will also benefit from the increasing dollars .
saving could see gains by higher yields , even though experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is harder to differentiate from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said that they are only The Br@@ its im@@ it@@ ated
parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle the broadcast The Voice on and said that this is not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliam@@ ent@@ arians and increases new pressure on the transm@@ itters that he does something what the sen@@ ders does not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the publicly co @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform itself to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try something different - these are two spontane@@ ously called examples in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director showed the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far before his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I can &apos;t do anywhere else on classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works in order , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to be working hard to engage the audience when it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was however not the only part of the BBC production , which during the hearing organised during the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for action among fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Gardens The Voice of - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of 22 million £ .
do you see one , why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was produced in a special BBC fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that he wishes to make sure that the company &quot; take a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when it starts the next time a entertainment series .
however , it refused to exclude the order of more rows of The Voice in the Future or give money to pay@@ ers for other consumer formats .
Internet operations climbed in August at slow and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sale .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for sale
experts believe that the Black Friday marks your spending in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted again , and many of the major shopping streets of Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities .

total expenditure on August include the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y said the editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales .
he declared that the online sales increased three years ago when buyer began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now it is com@@ mu@@ te that and we may soon realize that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent renov@@ ations .
experts believe that buyers have their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .

B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European crafts@@ man is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified technicians from Eastern Europe has rise behind
this leads to that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix &apos;s shops that are aimed at crafts@@ man .
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q Sales release nationwide
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that British manage their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes for the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you are being sent to a hammer or a brush to increase walls , you now seem to be a minority .
for British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to run home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ f@@ isher who owns the Bau@@ markets chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified technicians from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices would be over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher wants to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that attach themselves to arti@@ sans and reach 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , since eight out of ten buying decisions in store are made by women .
at the moment , the men over@@ weigh the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends , who have more female single households , producing more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to shift that stronger to a balance .
princip@@ ally , half of our clients are made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed company , has also directed its top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company who has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and financial statements .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - this is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ f@@ isher signed a decline in half @-@ year &apos;s profit and outlines , after the Group ow@@ es the cost of the closing of the stores .
due to the trend King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open up 200 new stores .
functional from A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the National Park Kla@@ gen@@ furt took on Wednesday two leaders of the Austrian Volleyball vice @-@ vice @-@ master A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and for@@ tification .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them had been indi@@ cted for ministers .
from this accus@@ ation he has been acqu@@ itted in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor attorney , Robert Ri@@ ffel had also cryst@@ alli@@ zed in pre @-@ examination , that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were employed by the accounts concerning which they were disp@@ ose to their functions for private purposes .
the damage is done with about 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sport @-@ functional are also charged on account of financial statements .
this fact exp@@ ired the Chairman of the Sch@@ enc@@ ee , Ri@@ chter@@ ine Micha@@ ela San@@ in , composed of .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
in the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity the defence was the case that the association had no account at any point in time .
the sports functional would have been delayed for only allow@@ ances and paid the club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in whom they had invested a lot of time and money - Pas@@ cher@@ ished in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Qu@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue the club or deny it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ accused .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made money , which uns@@ killed our life insurance as safety with the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money free , there is only no debts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore - in case of appropriate financial success , the payment of the allow@@ ances was made from 1991 to 1991 .
therefore , one portion of the allow@@ ance exists only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been on the account , pays off .
therefore also l@@ ump @-@ form@@ work and not detailed information , explained the former Ob@@ mann the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accounts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to the two def@@ endants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the second def@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why the pay@@ outs of the association had not been disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
the association was not interested in detail for the financial birth , if only the school freedom has been , so the answer .
when in 2011 against the func@@ tionary investigations , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros were transferred to the club account .
these were rep@@ lied , the accused .
this publisher ran down to the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known to the association according to the statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; , wanted the col@@ dness to know .
in this case the respon@@ dents did not ask a reply .
then he said , he believed that this is the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known any of this money , the prosec@@ utor exhibited in the room .
the compl@@ ained would have been informed , the function@@ al@@ ted of the function@@ al@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was written as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damages ? , wanted to know &apos; wor@@ sen@@ ing and prosec@@ utor .
stated that the first accused did not agree with this wording as the association never seemed to be done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore the official , he never referred to a cent sal@@ ary , he merely pays divi@@ ding and di@@ ets .
for di@@ ets put it into account the Club 1,000 Euro per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added .
precise documents for the early years were unable to instru@@ ct the accused .
these are after a surgery , in which everything had been judged correctly and was no longer kept , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second def@@ endant .
all the containers can be made in cash , so that he must drive from his dom@@ ici@@ le international market to the bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will be continued on September 23 , with the survey of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world ob@@ serves when the US @-@ denom@@ ination goes on two days , together on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether , for the first time since almost a decade , interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among more than 80 econom@@ ists who were surv@@ eyed held by Re@@ uters that the F@@ ed was doing this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will keep a little longer and the interest rates will keep on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest in NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero range and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , leading staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy has been added to a relatively good performance , added to a balance sheet and generate just a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the fewer ru@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that chances against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday
overcoming the death of the Delta State University
after the shot and kill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later flow@@ ed his colleagues on the day and sle@@ w Sh@@ annon written a note to say that there are &quot; sympathy &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said he &apos;s lecturer in Geo@@ graphy and Social Education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said , he was shot and someone killed .
he told the employee of the emergency number that police polic@@ emen would be send to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took my wife yesterday evening and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will be disturbing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the An@@ ru@@ fer after his name , but he did not give him .
he has no explanation for his shots .
when police were entrusted to the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I am sorry , I could und@@ one .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the records he took 300 miles to the Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing before he finally took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen were surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the University of William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , it &apos;s alle@@ ge@@ dly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there I give &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ inde@@ er was shot by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years ago , as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced back 15 years ago , but made friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have one daughter who is 19 and was destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss their daughter &quot; were absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , following statement by L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had poss@@ essed a dog called Light@@ ning held for about three years with Lamb .
&quot; they always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , he sent me to a certain point in Monday to say to them , &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
as a polic@@ eman him on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he &apos;s driving his car to the side , ran into the woods and sle@@ w themselves with a shot .
he &apos;s received a PhD title in the spring of 2015 as his li@@ ke@@ e@@ word on the university &apos;s website . he &apos;s represented in the spring of 2015 .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa plans a large group of concert .
the Lufthansa Group will only want to save on half a billion euros in the year , with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1000 executives will cost balance of work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot &apos;s union , there is in@@ the new negotiation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lufthansa expands its corporate structure and adds to the Billi@@ g@@ to@@ e Euro@@ wings .
the target of real@@ ign@@ ment is a contribution of about 500 million euros per year from cost and proceeds , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , the Lufthansa will not be in charge of passenger transport .
the Billi@@ g@@ ticket line Euro@@ wings sol@@ le therefore be developed as independent as possible .
in the background team headed the Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
with its new adjustment , Sp@@ oh@@ r underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .

in addition to the transitional provision of the pil@@ ots , the &quot; wings &quot; is the &quot; wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play monthly for double issues
Luke Sha@@ w exp@@ ire at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , a double question of his right leg .
while it brought the outer self @-@ defense to the we@@ eping and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w is able to play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes in the pitch and needed oxygen , before he was brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double base in the hospital and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 at Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic plays , and then what happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will last , and he will not play in the group .
I hope he can play this season again .
Moreno seemed happy , to escape a Red Card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ eller .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not pun@@ ished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al affir@@ med that the Italian refer@@ ee was mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card was required .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account answered , &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I will come back stronger again . &quot;
here in relation : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
England &apos;s defen@@ ders has an added incentive with the European Championship in France to recover from ahead to next June .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury the place are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Moreno comes a leg @-@ off , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland Team during the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ cu .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Moreno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - according to a f@@ oul@@ game by Chris Sm@@ all@@ .
surely David Cameron and Lor@@ ax knows better ?
it is one thing that loving all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , released in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , not@@ ing Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; mer@@ it , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to have an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in the Cameron want to describe the plot of the book , instead , returns a ingredient of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled town of Th@@ reads @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , bringing his desire to see a real tree , fulfil@@ s , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss host@@ ages lou@@ dly and the 1991 died , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partially presented as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie based on the web site of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the action of the book so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the cas@@ gre@@ ening , trees per@@ pen@@ ing , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ enden lu@@ gs , a ho@@ ckey , snor@@ ing beings , &quot; which is referred to in the name of the trees . &quot;
possibly such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , which The Lor@@ ax has not read the least 20 times a child .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons Ele@@ mentary office .
Campbell &apos;s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but gave no further immediate comment .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion from the UK team but it is still difficult
to b@@ lossom in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you choose the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map .
I would not have an reverse side not to close .
A@@ last@@ y C@@ ooks page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry out s@@ cars by 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test level is an option for the attack .
in this message : Adam Ly@@ th is separ@@ ating from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his chief @-@ trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ Player is oriented towards results .
there were no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination as - and I have said this before - players are their own best choices .
long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
when he hopefully strikes him more mu@@ k@@ shire for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming out .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he did not give so good performances and that surprise me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test @-@ provo@@ ke receives to put his signs is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got .
only Comp@@ ton gave the chance to do home and backward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise up was that England was first deser@@ ving in the Caribbean at first - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales come in and he is a stroke that I highly regard .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he reached 2@@ 36 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge square that met us very well .
it has to obtain at least the same chances as the one before him , but this course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een aside from Cook , which render an extra @-@ Spin Bow@@ ler and four qu@@ icks are preserved , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I do not see why a stro@@ man can not beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ scale cri@@ cket of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my earlier team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before being opened in 2001 as an Open@@ er .
he has made three hundred R@@ us immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited company dealing with him , he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup titles who lift their hands and the trainers have op@@ ted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few smart supplements at the coaches .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ter , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the testing games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experiences as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that it is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he saw insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can get fresh air in the locker room , even though the messages are in line with the previously said .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ ok@@ es , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but co@@ c@@ aches and team@@ players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are made not slight heart .
Bre@@ xit &apos;s warehouse ( Bre@@ xit = Equi@@ pped Great Britain from the EU ) could gain an allow@@ ance when the Economy was thrown into a flu@@ ff for the year 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ paid re@@ char@@ me strategy to hold the Great Britain in the EU will go deeper with each day deeper into difficulties , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n leads to the leaders of Labour or the Tu@@ c , which suffered severe due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ bi@@ ans and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European Diplom@@ acy and recently said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gling into different crises , such as the EU is now and not always of their own debt , Britain itself issued agenda with ru@@ ined concessions and dis@@ rup@@ ting contracts that they mostly do not want .
in Brigh@@ ton , Tu@@ c chose the annual meeting that it does not like this even if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Tar@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
prime minister and finance minister climb towards summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a picture of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will gain alliances for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wishes the Great Britain inside the EU &apos;s tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ earn us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and shows that there are more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials from some capitals to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany war@@ med chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years now and wants to leave the office , before it looks bad for it , as it is done with the exagger@@ ated long per@@ sever@@ ity such as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election , or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ aded power .
Poland could soon have a nation@@ alist rights government , Spain a left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be rus@@ hed to a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy better for it to prevent Scotland &apos;s leaving from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar dis@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers might even inten@@ tionally not find helpful notes , quite in SN@@ P @-@ style , whereas Great Britain &apos;s sales com@@ b 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend .
&quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite , and &quot; Britain has nothing won from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how they can be red@@ ly the spot on their own expense and which EU Sk@@ ep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one as they did not see during the referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s referendum ( 1975 ) , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ uni@@ sts who gave himself a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ ans years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his bl@@ eness , Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing Sch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ breaking out@@ lands and the P@@ seudo non @-@ In@@ länder , who own most of our major newspapers .
actually I thought Tony Bla@@ ir similar to her , but made sure that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you get better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of being at his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he re@@ bu@@ sted on Cam@@ er@@ el &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the Treaty of the EU who was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a back@@ door for him .
the press has never for@@ sake him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ bi@@ n , who gave me on Monday to Westminster a friendly sla@@ p on the back - I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me to waste water - seems in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck Bo@@ und@@ ott Mur@@ doch ky &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ er years to repeat a mistake at that time and today .
it may take but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC &apos;s sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ s. official position on Europe is - I express it by being friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform @-@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blood @-@ ar@@ b@@ ish tendency and the wil@@ der poems by Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ änder@@ ism may well say any to this .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite , Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ bi@@ n appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor , was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father worked in television to be loyal to his Labour Party chief , without going too far and losing its cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight &quot; in all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades , and MPs according to all reports on their postpon@@ ement on Monday .
whatever the stir@@ red @-@ up @-@ up image from Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a brood @-@ centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct to give Cameron no open card for Europe who allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ee campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks safe so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ no fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities in EU membership - in accordance with their B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ rin economy , their anti @-@ capital@@ istic past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sid@@ ents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ cism of the small under@@ score is a central principle of dog@@ matic ys .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is strongly convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to go away - foreign diplom@@ ats will try to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin are wast@@ ed political capital - they have also susp@@ icious elec@@ torate - to make concessions to the British when this can be useless ?
the US has already been rather disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded of something when starting on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critici@@ ze the report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was born from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , have joined The Lanc@@ et by critici@@ ze the references used by Public Health England ( hic ) in her report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ hic published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ status report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the load@@ ability of the data and directed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month accessed the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on the p@@ hic its most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; made &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical epidemi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the asser@@ tion of p@@ hic that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking , based on a detailed review of proof and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people which were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision decision ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis -@@ M@@ C@@ DA ) to guide their opinions about the damage caused by various nicotine inhal@@ ation ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director has previously received British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study before British American Tob@@ acco .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the financing that he has received according to reports beforehand from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a section financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting you took a selection of the p@@ hic leaders .
the research work of the group &quot; is subscri@@ bing &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; tough evidence &quot; for the damages of most products at most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions will be discussed in the p@@ hic report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes being served as a way to smoking for children or smoking . &quot;
professional Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ hic , said that the cont@@ en@@ tions of BM@@ J was already responded to earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all the evidence suggest that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are low , but that we continue to have the long term effects to study .
p@@ hic has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence does and what not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0.000 people are dying every year on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health system two billion £ a year .
through the clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should place East@@ En@@ ders , says a former Chief of Channel 4
the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm , for hit shows as the Albert Times So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ itters .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are considered public legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard cont@@ ented time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and by Sen@@ ators like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were commissioned or sends , which were also clearly shown by not sub@@ stan@@ tive ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communication committee as part of its investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you would like to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which I consider in Central and long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least give your production at least to programs which do not do or order .
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve as broad support for their future as possible .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous it is natural .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I will see comp@@ elled to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t believe it would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
Johnson , a employer for series , leader 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for hunting for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC announce that what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ ri@@ gar@@ t @-@ presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows are to sell as East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more openly @-@ legal N@@ om @-@ programmes were to go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure rather the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they could argue if they have created on their seem@@ ing sacred missions for justification from 4 billion £ broad@@ cast@@ ers , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest fee , Johnson said to the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , remember all , that you receive a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who is for the 150 l@@ bs a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to form , &quot; to form and entertain . &quot;
he said only little by the BBC @-@ production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that there would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should be taking this example in the publicly co @-@ law television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a handful of TV will be shown and with the commercial powers @-@ alliances in order to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ thing &apos; can control bra@@ id cells through sound waves
the video shows how the ne@@ mato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are broad@@ cast@@ ed with sound impulses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by cross@@ ings of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they have with sound impulses , which have to be heard for human hearing at high frequencies in order to be heard .
the impulses work through the inser@@ tion of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells , which can be modified gene@@ tically to carry the membrane channels , which respond to an ultras@@ ound .
further on this subject : researcher read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o@@ il@@ y@@ la , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a range of brain , heart and muscle cells outside of the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ er@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of the brain , an inv@@ asi@@ ves method that gives electric stim@@ uli into the brain of men to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
tor@@ ches generally did not respond to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ lu@@ ani made it that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves act on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels are called and in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells are found .
the sound waves ensure the opening of these I@@ on@@ en@@ channels and enable the cells to assigned to them , such a report Nature Communications .
to create an ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ den , modified Chal@@ ets gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ oc@@ alisation TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ channels carry .
when he turns out ultras@@ ound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are strengthened by the micro@@ particles and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the altered mot@@ oc@@ ism .
the procedure has several similarities with op@@ to@@ ke , a ground @-@ breaking tool , which enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulse of light and turn off .
but Chal@@ az@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ thing could have some advantages over this technique .
unlike light , which must be revealed in an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain , kidney @-@ waves can be un@@ hin@@ dered , can be hin@@ dered in the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the cited human neur@@ ons temporarily sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ az@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student dormitory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral relief vis@@ m , but only now I remember the gr@@ ated smiling of those I have been angry - and in the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most , what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the move in student dormit@@ ories extends from slightly nerve wre@@ cking up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to share : people wh@@ ence wh@@ ence thou com@@ ers , where and where you have taken Sab@@ ate year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly sh@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in the Ernst , guys , there is only a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show you interest .
it acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you may not speak to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were on fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people be affected .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night events and communal meeting places , but they also are the places where people are tigh@@ tening and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ sp@@ ects receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ area @-@ B@@ um@@ mel @-@ culture , which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship go further , but you have to go away so I get back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant is exhausted by convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of &apos; kno@@ ck .
A@@ pro@@ pos ank@@ ham : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a not closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship through b@@ aking .
since you start the university at the height of the Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ bs on the doors of men to present themselves with a plate of Brow@@ nies , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve got to give you something . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade le@@ es is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mate feel obliged to entertain yourself and will in the end perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
obviously this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat lead that people get sleeping whenever you anchor .
To ste@@ al food is a common crime in student dormit@@ ories .
of course , the clo@@ ister is a rob@@ ber@@ y , but is it the pick of a drop of body for your tea too ?
check this with the special owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they bo@@ il in the inner .
if somebody is missing your stuff , is the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , which added to its milk a r@@ ins@@ ing to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
it is now in prison .
they should make no noise , the people keep away from sleep or working .
it is not only about being a decent being , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people who sit in the Glass House .
a girl in my corridor asked her neighbors , whether there is something to put them , Drum &amp; bass to place a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to this with still loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they let her neighbors still sleep two hours before they pl@@ agu@@ ed their own music and made her door shut and took her three @-@ hour test .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student dormitory ?
vice versa , it would not be deeply embarrassing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage , to get off to them , and then have to see it every day and perhaps to experience how to get all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future encounter in her , try to give a little sens@@ ations at least .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in his un@@ closed room has left the boundary between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing ra@@ a when it seems .
a good battle is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
permit by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never chew@@ ing someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut down your door , and insert their keys into a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but t@@ oss your possessions on the ceiling not more than twice fixed .
Rei@@ her@@ ons for refugees , omni@@ direc@@ ting , Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners
the real estate subsidiary Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds up in the Middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian terr@@ aced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so about refugees -- but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need g@@ hr@@ am but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am showing how to build a cheap and well built today &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees are being pushed onto the market .
the entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds on a project of terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will drive in the market market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or sports has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part of it here .
in light of the refugee movement , we need to be sufficient living space in the next decades .
a completely renovated , three @-@ story house @-@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different if people are putting people in housing sil@@ ences .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three dwell@@ ings for each of four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be changed easily according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
g@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is about 184 000 Euro , without land .
this is over@@ looked .
six months the construction took place .
this is appropriate .
are building regulations complicated their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : building right I have drawn my project correctly .
very complicated , it always makes the dro@@ pping d@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ kin for special construction and the adjusting arrangements .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ sets who creates in a house house three apartments , needs at least three plots .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants of their self @-@ service react ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there have been those who have been sent to me in creating a luxury building for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but what does it tigh@@ ten up in competition for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : this is true : we had built a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built of luxury apartments which can afford hardly any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room .
not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ moving mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners .
I am showing how to build good and well even today .
that is why it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by typ@@ ing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Android app &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have come to problems after installation , as they receive a message that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to deal with the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the on@@ set goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the deletion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more likely by merging the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then install them anew as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth it to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located close to a char@@ gers , so the battery is loaded .
if the cargo is too low , Apple can not be continued that the update continues to be continued , since the phone could be shut up half way and this might lead to a break @-@ off of updates .

it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ ting out of years Frank Mu@@ eller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met , who currently acqu@@ ires her medical business studies in the hospital and ann@@ ot@@ ted the year into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage I would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was there I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple of Müller served the idea to practice their own practice in the future in As@@ endorf .

furthermore , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also highly @-@ driven to our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cent@@ ering in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants a asylum application cannot be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , that there is clear signals &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the prime minister said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we cannot accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , neither about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia itself
Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia plans to leave refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under circumstances also establish corri@@ dors for refugees .
he did not look at the prison of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corri@@ dors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is going to intensify the surveillance of the borders - especially for Hungary - intensify . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border with Croatia has been largely controlled at the border of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the prime minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to un@@ lock its borders to refugees .
&quot; each &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government passed , the first refugees had already tried to travel during the night @-@ hours to Tuesday in eastern Croatia at the border crossing to T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to go past to escape the registration .
the Croatian police could rise up to the nearby maxi fields .
according to local media , since then in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , he has constantly met police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also lif@@ ebo@@ ats and the Red Cross is already in use .
in the coming days , his country with around 4,000 refugees said , Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo against the Maced@@ onian border , which have so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , the Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade ranks , however , that it is to beat human beings to put certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reporting , at least in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrive in the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d along the course of the day further buses would be expected .
cross Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were travelling all night from the approximately 500 kilometres to the distant Maced@@ onian border through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made , so the police declared that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually indeed lead to a predicted shift in the former Balkans @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west track .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country is preparing for the fall of a strong state of refugees that prepared appropriate plans for possible conditions of exceptional circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call him but he pointed out that Croatia was as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities of border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since been a leading testimony to the country as a result of the standard of border controls .
more than 300 refugees stop on Serbian side behind the Hungarian border .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ zing media we would like to spend the past night at the bo@@ ar@@ der Hor@@ goes , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two bor@@ der@@ ings of the Congo and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remains completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to put his career at a local attack in Hor@@ ego : he kept the debates on alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not currently act for very high refugee quantities .
you could not say if they would continue their trip over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ per rates of migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees had already begun to distribute maps to refugees where alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border over@@ flow between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of Croatian elections still un@@ clean min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of Min@@ en@@ min@@ ers was sent in the border region .

that not everyone wanted to tell them publicly , whether it is understandable , finally it is a very personal matter .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result Mi@@ xed , Fin@@ anz @-@ prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appoint results for the last quarter , and the Consu@@ mptions of the Consu@@ l shows his profit margins in a whole year due to the weak@@ est demand for shipping services and higher costs in his Bod@@ dens .
the company also said that she is planning to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 Se@@ as@@ per for the holidays .
at this point in last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to place 50,000 seasonal workers for holiday periods .
the share fell over 2.5 per cent in the market @-@ market for 45 minutes before opening up on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp said that you earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May 20 c@@ ents less than the previous predi@@ ction .
an@@ alysts anticipated by a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower perspective comes in spite of the price increases , which amounts to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective in January 4 , despite more inf@@ all for Bod@@ dens of heavy and large packages which will be charged from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it is still expecting the result from the previous year due to cost reductions , higher income and growth in online trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid yields , if one draws much weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for holidays were announced one day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , who plans to adjust 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional staff , roughly the same number as last year .
in the third quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex has served € 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
the earnings per share stood at € 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research questioned an@@ alysts .
sales climbed by 5 percent to 12,@@ 3 billion dollars .
six of runner @-@ asked an@@ alysts anticipated 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a drop in the international primary shipping process over the last few years , providing sales in its unit priority shipment .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express @-@ unit posted higher income due to higher rates , while the result of higher labour costs sank in the cargo business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stocks increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed by 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11th June .
at their most anticipated meeting in the years Federal Reserve C@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week about a 27 @-@ walk in Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the benchmark for the first time since almost a decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thre@@ aten them at the end of the established , two @-@ storey seats are a mur@@ als of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ els and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all else .
the Central Bank has a second order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing the US @-@ employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an alarm with third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in deciding which is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from the unprecedented rate of interest since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows strongly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could anxi@@ ous to for@@ tify , these vol@@ ati@@ lity through the up@@ lifting of the interest of federal government bonds - and be it also just a quarter of the percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation primarily depend on what they are observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists , in the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification , continuing to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing is un@@ insured in itself the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloomberg have predicted this week .
however , the financial markets expect a de@@ fle@@ ction of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator which indicates a 30 % chance on an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the str@@ ate@@ es alle@@ vi@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage worth 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was caused by expectations that the F@@ ed politics sustain@@ s the set in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Princip@@ al at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they go very far in their explanation to re@@ assure the financial markets , so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a po@@ int@@ ment would re@@ assure the financial markets , because they will be uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , F@@ ed seemed on good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow shar@@ pen@@ ing of the mon@@ et@@ een conditions that would test the strength of recreation in the US .
Y@@ e had said in spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints of Liber@@ als that would be needed more economic advance , an increase of the proposition is anticipated .
though the creation of jobs in August slow@@ down , the improvement of the labour market in this year was solid .
the unemployment rate decreased from 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
pay@@ ers have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation led continuously under the goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives said that the main reason was the temporary effect from significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om with Pantheon Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world agreed together at the end of the last month after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell in May by more than 16 % below his peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ ing of the Chinese economy would increase global growth .
the market has recovered something in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now at almost 10 % below the yo@@ ke of May .
for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , the market tum@@ ul@@ ants influence the complex calculation , when one should increase the interest rates .
&quot; when events are not occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of Chinese economy in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low , U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff .
now he says that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better get a grip on .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data on the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is none of the principal , therefore they should not be involved in their decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the impact of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere notice of the then director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tight expansion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; con@@ sol@@ vers around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ connected , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives are expected not only to monitor the developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey l@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ actions on financial market movements that are associated with apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
l@@ acker , voting rights of the Federal Open Market Committee , proposes a sign of action , used decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite having more recognizable impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said l@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives began this cuts .
the F@@ ed should address aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market ceremony . in 2008 , Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; they certainly don &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they are afraid of a military counter@@ part , because the markets are exciting , &quot; said Poznań , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe it should require the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany this day .
welcome to them , we do not go without the engagement of innumerable volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people seeking un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus Heine .
Petra Heine is with body and soul a teacher .
as well as with their 74 lungs she still teaches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seekers , at the D@@ ill@@ inger street . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , this is quite different lessons than at a correct school .
Bra@@ sili@@ ens &apos;s pedi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy feeding
the Brazilian organization S@@ RS attempts to clear how important good nutrition during the l@@ ac@@ tation is how important good nutrition during the l@@ ac@@ tation is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at bro@@ ws who are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food painted .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients that they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers get into use their daily cal@@ orie intake to increase about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation to the mothers .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet radi@@ ated women really concerns the genes of their babies and it protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new aks of the sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the build for the € 2,@@ 3 million euros of the sport hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted gym &apos;s sports grounds are step by step : in the recent community meeting , the revised construction was dro@@ p@@ able without big discussions .
before , the Panel under another had made an application for a structural compensation &quot; exemp@@ tion of &quot; liberation &quot; of valid development plan .
with the &quot; exception &quot; it was given to the permission for a special form regarding the construction construction .
this conclu@@ des a &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ collabor@@ ated first and attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar generators : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we get a wonderfully large South pilgrimage together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , we went on the roof @-@ drawing , which is for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is reduced significantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the Dach@@ stein does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ad@@ der community usually drives more restri@@ c@@ tively to liber@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recur@@ ring project at the gym : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turn@@ around at the sport centre is a collaborative project by the municipality and St. Bern@@ ried .
costs are about 2.3 million euros per year .
subsidies are expected by the school@@ ing and Bre@@ iten@@ land promotion .
in the next process of procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now presented to the landing office as a result of the trial .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as director of the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with the Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this sees the amazing plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ chner was fir@@ med .
a decision on the Supervisory Board however , by the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board conven@@ ed on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented then all of the nearly 50 employees will be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority of Sun were to move with Fischer and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the spaces are available .
employees who can not be able to live with Sh@@ ong@@ au can be one work@@ station in W@@ eil@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the staff was informed of their plans .
triggered the change the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic until the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
in the question what the successor is to compete , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into the game according to Jo@@ chner and White , who is willing to take over the leadership and take his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au from October 1 .
for the House in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offering in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
Fischer is a specialist for core @-@ cent@@ en@@ macher and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
over the next two years Fischer has to agree with his team , when the Supervisory Board agrees that both houses lead , till then next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ r , which still has 35 beds , has been closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the country has planned this for 2018 , if the current recovery at the Hospital W@@ eil@@ heim has been completed .
Land@@ s@@ ine Jo@@ chner @-@ White , which is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , came forward that the rum@@ ors stood out after which the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , in the future as an accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say there are several reflections .
at present there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ ch@@ sychiat@@ ry .
&quot; what luck could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; so Fischer war@@ ves over the Qu@@ asi Mov@@ ing to Le@@ ch , who was positively received by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
a real perspective for the house , where fishermen have been employed as Chief veterin@@ arian for more than 30 years now .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was always under threat of closure , of course over the past decades , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lion are requested tonight ( 20.@@ 15 h ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the stand@@ ings of the Bundesliga is in Wuppertal the clear favorite , cause for arro@@ gan@@ ce . however none .
in the past season , the s@@ wimm@@ ers in the B@@ HC , related to the B@@ HC , have a sore defeat and have something to benefit there .
Jag@@ gem@@ case with Two Fort@@ ress at Pr@@ at@@ au
two Tr@@ actor @-@ drivers have been badly in@@ ju@@ red during their harvest afternoon on Friday &apos;s Friday .
during the aber@@ ration on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ scape Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use , as the police assigned .
after a fair price , a 63@@ U and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injury and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly there could come to the accident was first unclear .
the C@@ ID was determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violence
a Tat@@ ow@@ si@@ ger has led the police for the body of the last Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year old , the young people were killed and their body was thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
one on Saturday was missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a victim of violence fallen to the victim .
the corp@@ se of young woman was found on the service evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ utor and police broke off in Wednesday .
as a tat@@ too susp@@ icious one also considered on the evening of pre @-@ recorded 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who have indeed st@@ acked the indication and investig@@ ators the inquiries to the place of corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday mor@@ nings , after it was closed on the eve after a visit to a Aut@@ umn in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , as agreed at home .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ator initially sits on personal objects of the victim .
for surveys in the friend@@ ships and acquaint@@ ances of the missing sur@@ rendered , finally a pa@@ suspici@@ on against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the mut@@ ul@@ ence of the perpetrators led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
the be@@ was reported to the authorities in the police trial , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be tried by the haf@@ er on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him shelter at the load .
conclusions on the immediate circumstances of the act will be investig@@ ating further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns in front of the housing
the situation in the German housing market is stra@@ ined .
also more and more refugees seek a paid bun@@ ny .
pressure on the market market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution competitions in the German housing market have long ago started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the upcoming refugees and working people from the EU more and more people are pushing onto a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens around the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , we would have to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this end there is a study on behalf of the association agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Wel@@ fare &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to compare , there are 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units in Germany this year .
this will be missing 14@@ 0.000 apartments .
refugees have no longer obliged to live for the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers in an initial education entrance .
many have come across the apartment market and rows in the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
according to statistics , the Federal Chancell@@ ery was staying less than half of all asylum seekers for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising refugee figures .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is moving into a housing benefit from year to year .
currently missing in the metropolitan areas already have some 77@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings , lam@@ ents Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many of them were therefore dwelling in large cities in each apartment in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained free of charge in the apartment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities the number of square meters per head has fallen back for the first time in the last years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is propos@@ ing a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , new incentives are to boost social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could be wai@@ ved of the under@@ size tax and the basic tax for sponsored dwell@@ ings will be exposed .
furthermore , according to an Alliance , attractive tax deduc@@ tions are needed .
the support program for refugee from the national bank Kf@@ W comes to towns and villages already well .
a good week after the start was at Monday , with 184 million euros already more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros .
now , the project might even be absorbed .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia set corri@@ dors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following Hungary there is practically no more announcements , since more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces passing through Slovenia to north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to interact with the neighbouring land of Slovenia about setting up a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian interior and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the exter@@ mination of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people were coming over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of the Croatian city of RT@@ L .
Hungary had its border for refugees on the day before the day .
new laws issued on the same day into force make it virtually need@@ less asylum procedure in Hungary .
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees during the Serbia on the border with Serbia on the border of Serbia .
most learned media report from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you arrived both by bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees did not encounter the border .
this is the bor@@ ro@@ strip of other dangers : there are even sharp scru@@ pul@@ ls from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
reduc@@ er should now create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closing of the border , there are hardly any refugees .
on Tuesday the police was counted by 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday we were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian La@@ ws leads to overcoming and damaging the limit level as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings in the South Hungary city of Sz@@ eged were taken in the capital city of Sz@@ eged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned thre@@ aten prison sentence up to five years and exp@@ ulsion from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , we received agreement on Tuesday to the newly elected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tran@@ se@@ date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total of 94 asylum races , nearly all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the patients there are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , more than 40 refugees would have stopped there .
but virtually no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected Asyl@@ um Se@@ ek@@ ers are to be be@@ de@@ ported from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there are only a few hundred refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to fail .
they gathered the l@@ itter , which had left tens of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
ply@@ wood have been destroyed and one of the roofs have been rebuilt in the bor@@ der@@ ard .
for the purpose of this reconstruction , nobody wanted to express .
Austria is only reaching a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also has reinforced its border controls .
about 20,000 immigrants we stopped after the government , but still in the country .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the journey to Germany .
in the morning the passage from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in free@@ wheel regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot on a regular basis .
Mayor took the &quot; ran@@ ran@@ ged &quot; over the borders
&quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the premises , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice @-@ off@@ s at the entrance of Zel@@ da , &quot; so Wern@@ st@@ ere Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany took a surprise for Germany on Sunday as a result of the refugee movement with Austria was surprisingly set for her in Wern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offered its help and recru@@ it their cars across the borders to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before that we managed the un@@ hoped guest even once , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we said equally , we connect them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was natural for us , &quot; such as Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him to commit a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire fighting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recru@@ ited rail passengers were gone on the Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , to ensure it was stopped after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was placed at the boundary in Wern@@ stein am Inn .
in Wern@@ stein is the cross @-@ border general high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday , a two @-@ brid@@ ging day - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent another Z@@ ig@@ ne to us , is a logical result of an apparent political policy :
instead of helping in bearing r@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the establishment of structures , our Chancellor continued to rise highly and publicly placed the position of the Hungarian government in the d@@ unge@@ ons of National Socialism .
unfortunately , this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the border areas with mess@@ y states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees too will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pur@@ ported country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed us , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there will be a huge challenge , in the face of the sustained refugee streams and the coming winter , to make decent conditions for the protection of people .
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5.000 hiber@@ nation Qu@@ arti@@ s
Konrad has fully paid all hands with the refugee output .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen bank in order to put odds for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the former education center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on in the handle .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without great tur@@ mo@@ il , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master power &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interior of the office spoke on the hand of a &quot; scratch @-@ def@@ ective situation . &quot;
total is calculated according to a demand of 8@@ 5,000 mer@@ ges in the he@@ ur@@ age year .
to fulfill the number , must be found in the next weeks yet 3@@ 5.000 accommodations - 20,000 to provide the Länder ( 15@@ ,000 ) of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; but it is not a bott@@ om@@ less pit , &quot; said Konrad .
with the full representatives he has already led talks .
they could have assured him even for the upcoming refugees Sum@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP Mand@@ atar is assisted by Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , he will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations , the asylum coordin@@ ator also put in the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can freely offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ len@@ ders have to respect a certain amount of hand @-@ holder or size .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a fixed time would have to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that in contrast to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , he was more successful with his experience , due to his experience .
I am a older gentle@@ man who is not able to face the un@@ truth without further notice .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic as they said by themselves .
their number of employees want to increase it on three to four .
the custom product search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to add a container to the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there is apparently problems with permission .
Linz is demanding a better division
the opening of the city of sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for lodging of refugees plans the city of Linz .
but in the moment it is not necessary , as one can still lodge the persons concerned without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger said .
but in case of emergency , further sites are to be tested on their vi@@ ability .
critic@@ isms , the director , and the division of the refugees within the Federal State .
also other areas must contribute their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone with the Bav@@ arian Minister of Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ er ( VP ) received further procedures in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer told me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is to be possible .
but there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special tra@@ its with refugees to Germany won &apos;t be left at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the requ@@ esting agencies would do with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria once again leads Austria to its limits , is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans as a logical consequence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general start of the &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial page is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT @-@ Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the kl@@ u@@ y heads are our raw material - and we must try them working for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes p@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can imagine to invest in start @-@ up firms of the New Wer@@ ft and later also hold what to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - where lower desc@@ endant promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.@@ 7 million euros have been invested at the location of S &amp; T in the location of € 3.@@ 3 million from Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is designed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square metres resi@@ des in the building are rented out , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the centre of attention .
Jutta means really wanted to gain a dog altogether .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year owners of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pi@@ geon @-@ market @-@ Arctic . eventually , she has now got growth in the form of another business loc@@ ales .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop in relation to the business , in which it sells , among other things , suit@@ cases , shoes and vest@@ ments of different manufacturers , all around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , pur@@ se are available from 75 Euro .
larger pan@@ try and accessories costs up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in use .
never before has several weeks been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over@@ lays whether I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says broad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , decisive for the decision was that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a private location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the natives in the Greater Region Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has even Italian roots .
your fashion interest has spread wide from her mother to cradle .
I de@@ cks the most when something develops and I can show new trends at competitive prices .
why so some woman with the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , in addition , the house@@ wife can not answer the last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag must be upgraded to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher of K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named ambass@@ adors .
this characteristic also links some with the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for claims .
whether he is expressed alien , journalists , or knowledge of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential election r@@ ens the electoral campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate origin@@ ator originate .
the New Yor@@ kers with the Fe@@ eling refresh@@ ed is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ village at the Wein@@ straße .
man@@ holes in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village is related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the voting mode .
the K@@ all@@ ella Simone Wen@@ del turned out a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do vill@@ agers think about his goal to become migh@@ ti@@ est man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow we find exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters nature is not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native ch@@ hi@@ ker has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ ra@@ dishes made , which besides tru@@ mp also the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz belongs .
Tru@@ mp , which is not known for mod@@ esty is Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) Also to word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts he has not brought it there .
although I give respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to say that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a little &apos; w@@ ron@@ l &apos; , he says Wen@@ del .
random the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the Vic@@ tory , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the an@@ ender , says it .
Tru@@ mp is thus coming from the village of An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for the min@@ er in the US .
property of the property concept were first floor purchases in New York .
the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her wish , to return in the long time to the home , engaged in the Bav@@ arian State , belonged to the Palat@@ inate , at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the Director of the Institute for P@@ äl@@ z@@ ische History and Eth@@ n@@ ology , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is contrary to the inter@@ mitt@@ ent statements of the desc@@ endant .
he repeatedly talked to about Mexican immigrants in the United States and required to build a border wall to dis@@ courage illegal immigrants .
&quot; as as the poly@@ mer , that is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote asset ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born de@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born &quot; ) .
the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so cru@@ mb@@ ling . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never looked at K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ aci@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ram@@ m men@@ tions such as man@@ holes K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit ended up something for the Pap@@ al organ which was generally fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine the Donald Donald &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they process it better when he did not win the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those , who had been in the US at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more exciting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ck Sarah Mari@@ ker .
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe also without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
W@@ end@@ els movie , which has been inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp , have seen 12 000 movies , even in the USA is watching the interest .
the Upper Bav@@ arian municipality of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the national park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ ber villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country the local Alpine Club is responsible for receiving the award .
a &quot; mining village &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be reported as a prot@@ ru@@ ding area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over loss of leadership at the today show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson to Can@@ ber@@ ra will report to the loss of leadership in the Liber@@ als , but it has no major shifting of the reviews for today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull got the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot .
the Rival sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , put up in London as part of a week @-@ week series of international television programs , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n belonged .
this disadvantage of the condition seemed to not play a role for Australian TV audience , as Sun@@ rise was an average 39@@ ,000 spectators on the five main cities , compared to that today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in comparison to the ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap in the last months has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August there reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 50,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40@@ ,000 and 50,000 .
so far in September Sun@@ rise stands on an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affects this morning more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star from Re@@ to the Raf@@ a@@ Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recently enth@@ r@@ wit@@ ted father , who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son got a hit show Solo without the grand@@ mother Star Rebecca Gib@@ k@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and it proposed The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new tri@@ via show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ K@@ ee@@ ter , on average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ppies Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on the Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 spectators and recorded in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make Nine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately catch on at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute which won &apos;t keep the Mc@@ Gu@@ ppies show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably appeared unknow@@ ingly , who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood in The Bachelor is ground@@ ed , was wrapped in biggest secrecy .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not surrender , whether the one is the one that has received the last rose .
but as we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows one day before coming from three two , you possibly have acci@@ dently gave an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues its lips until the final on Thursday un@@ sealed
all three women have left themselves out on a ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and asked his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , when the question is posed , &quot; If not you , who should be W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could their answers to play playing , who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki Pie@@ ce both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had one simple relationship with each other on the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were quite compatible , and I have thought of the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood as couple would be well suited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the last week it was clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m still un@@ condi@@ tionally put on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked , whom Wood was to choose if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 on ten .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in the US &apos;s move to the US - and there were many other teams sending requests to his stunning open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise choice .
some trainers would have ex@@ iled Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a bar@@ angel so lost when it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League conver@@ ters on Tuesday with 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ yr@@ ula made familiar with his husband and Hay@@ ne gave the next opportunity for a unt return and in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding its ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ yr@@ ula increased Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sports re@@ porter , In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who ri@@ el him to forget his ver@@ ted F@@ ang and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne patented in a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian poems for his N@@ FL @-@ debut .
Hay@@ ne left behind the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ently the play@@ field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that now occurs , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne mixed the car@@ vers with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ debut in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters call for the high refugee figures due to the amount of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned about the start of the F@@ W @-@ autumn cl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ Wal@@ stadt before a serious crisis on Bay@@ erns schools , if it is not a new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collap@@ ses , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get off@@ ences in the Bav@@ arian Educational System . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters are t@@ opped until Friday in the fran@@ con@@ fession@@ al commune .
actually there were very different main topics .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course the theme for Asyl@@ um , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger challenged the establishment of UN Schutz@@ zones for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as it gave them during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we do not continue , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers , the Free voters want to post@@ p@@ one as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff to the administrative speci@@ als , which are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder will not be consistent : &quot; we br@@ ate a nationwide uniform standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts from , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be more able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the local government should not fall under the table under the table .
a long@@ time ever@@ gre@@ ens remains on the agenda : the immigration policy .
for the new school year K@@ ult@@ us@@ minister Ludwig St@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has started at 47 secondary level the pilot testing &quot; middle @-@ level plus &quot; in which an extension of the foreign @-@ school year @-@ level is tested from three to four years - in the result it takes nine years to completion .
however , that is not far enough .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W @-@ Chief .
we call for freedom of choice for all upper secondary schools who want to do that .
free ride at G@@ 9 wherever it will be wished .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen on a rubber wave on prot@@ esters in Nepal shoot .
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police officers showed a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said one official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out at the service of the district Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Bish@@ op@@ ha@@ zy D@@ ha@@ kal , leading District be@@ am@@ ter , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , with some of them threw those stones and bran@@ db@@ om@@ bs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police I used Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ a and then shot in the air before it takes back on rubber floors .
20 police officers and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , known from which they can kill , but traditionally used as a lesser deadly alternative , apparently a high death rate produced .
the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that would be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tor@@ ables , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 human beings , among them are 11 police officers , have been involved in violent struggles since the 10th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed by centuries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution is on its way since 2008 but the legis@@ lat@@ ure accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that in April thousands of people had killed thousands of people .
the legis@@ lat@@ ure have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plans for the Holidays house of the Little Sea at Em@@ den can be taken .

the plans for a new agriturismo to the little sea lie near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday Even@@ ing in the city council committee of the Em@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which warn the investor and managing secrecy , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends by the System @-@ Building @-@ Management in the offensive : &quot; we do not yet have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is good , to be able to address all rum@@ ours now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been around ten to twelve million euro projects for months in the discussion .
fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners who were coming to the meeting were the pictures and new details for the desired hotel structure .
Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ owner and Board of Directors with the Adv@@ oc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; this is a huge pad , which overlooks all other pu@@ au@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like quite a number of other project critics that would increase traffic by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are coming up entire m@@ ts so that it is calculated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz
what exactly is happening on the good one h@@ ect@@ are of the old host@@ ages , is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we must have a concl@@ usive concept and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is not even absent , the development plans are still vari@@ abel .

Google launches a double @-@ money campaign to gather 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a release @-@ to @-@ raise campaign to help the thousands of refugees trying out thousands of refugees trying to bro@@ w the European nations , as they flee from war and flee countries .
Google has an unusual personal approach at the disclosure of the money call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google @-@ collabor@@ ator who fled with their family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; on our journey includes many dark railway and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them .
I was lucky .
but since the refugees and migrants are grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ perate after help .
the donations will go to four non @-@ profit organisations responsible for refugees and migrants : doctors with no borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million people , based on 11 million dollars .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four years of civil war in Syria , selling more than 4 million people this year .
many refugees also flee from war to Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics can be helpful to weight loss surgery .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to tell if easily overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery .
weight loss or obesity , use different methods to scale the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted with people who are disease @-@ fat with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , some degree of weight regarding size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and Magen@@ to skin treatment - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who did not receive @-@ surgical diabetes treatments immediately at 29 .
amongst those who subjected itself to surgical procedure , buy in 36 % of the diabetes illness totally and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , compared to the diabetes , diabetes is completely only at one percent and partially at only two percent .
in addition , the results were out of the checks of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and of the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also o@@ vers@@ aw the patient blood levels of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 per cent , write the researchers .
after the operation the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - do not have the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results with the two types of the surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , the larger rel@@ ies in the BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2,@@ 1 % ) and was more of a complete overcome of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study has no survival benefit of surgery for five years , there is evidence from a study of severe people in Sweden , that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e people , who suffer from a obesity surgery , approximately 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - in comparison to a group , the conventional methods tried .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was soothing to persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; that is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors are supposed to start weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once you have accumulated these genetic changes that have identified their body with adi@@ pos@@ ity and diabetes is an revers@@ al really hard . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and imp@@ lied that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the refugees of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the long @-@ day refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that will conduct ethics studies .
he requested that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be submitted against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the western European countries is not admir@@ able , but the situation was not reasonable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
though the Dalai Lama visited Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees , is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries is dimin@@ ished .
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent response from the US has moved a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my sincere in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solving this issue lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence one , and this has prov@@ oked un@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four fold increase of dealer infection by children in recent 4 years
in the United States , there will report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , that are a heavily alcoholic disinf@@ ect@@ ants , including Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of hand @-@ infections in children below 12 years , the toxicity control centers report , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and sadly a percentage of them go into emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ infection det@@ ect@@ ant , while some do it to impress their friends or for a mut@@ ation with social media .
YouTube videos show how young people dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly re@@ infected dis@@ infection with non @-@ smoking mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a tough@@ er beverage .
younger children can be spot@@ ted by attractive fragrances of the disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ infection ) are those who are being rewarded .
there are dis@@ infection with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange , which are very pleasing for children .
Hän@@ de@@ dis@@ infection contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , few sy@@ r@@ ers can already lead to alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; reported Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ fts Center in the Hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not lo@@ osen for whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sprit@@ es from the straw@@ berry smell in school was taken into an emergency room .
your blood @-@ concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is deemed to be drunk at an adult by legal as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated them in G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah came his words and was not able to go when it arrived in emergency .
doctors said they over night in a separate children &apos;s clinic on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had joined the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tor@@ ia Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft @-@ free products or dis@@ infection and to store goods infection outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol @-@ poison@@ ing out there were a few dis@@ infection with deaths .
in 2013 two women in Ontario developed under the swal@@ lowing of ham@@ dis@@ infection , which contained a toxic , non @-@ reli@@ ed ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol sof@@ tly , a deadly solution , instead of ethylene gly@@ co@@ hol , which was noted as substance .
in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , began to det@@ oxi@@ fy their &quot; faculty of anti@@ bacterial drugs around the teaching space , &quot; says it was a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to deal@@ er@@ ti@@ zer and ex@@ iles them out of their room .

it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .

there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland that want to see these games .

why I will be a witness to an Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is to be put to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a viewer &apos;s gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip is executed by the tox@@ ic@@ ator .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will be able to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since often more applicants are available as places to decide , to decide who is chosen .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who will choose , that will emo@@ ve it emo@@ ve .
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will have developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to capture a notebook and a pen , to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma blame me on Twitter , to give my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoners how he wants it , and you get access .
I complain about her .
they adm@@ its that they &quot; could have put it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong that I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had trouble with some of the things I have said and written .
he didn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter is present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the relations work of the movement against death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ ters of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is next to sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts , which I have made .
I don &apos;t want to enter any details here again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is not guilty .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benefici@@ ary in deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of the murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death role .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter , to whom you can turn to this .
what you will get from me is , what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .

Peter M@@ oo@@ dy is holding that ste@@ wards tried to det@@ ach him and threatened to end racing sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy is holding that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables in the year , and dro@@ ves to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integral part of Racing Victoria and claimed them a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tries to do that which is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it went to the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ trial , with Li@@ dar@@ i , which he did not explain .
he had held for himself 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; see how to be highly ob@@ tru@@ sting grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about this , and I did eat long on it , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that all at once come out , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
you know that it is far @-@ reaching .
sometimes one respon@@ ds and one has to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to make use of the principal , and I want my owners think I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had made the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integral part of the company had tried to carry out its stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months say Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - which I will name if I asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to deliver information about what I do inside my stalls , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they are trying to grip me down .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , acting President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ rom@@ atic CEO , recent CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this time and still have it today .
should I believe that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L conduct itself and makes maybe people outside of trainers responsible for what is occurring in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and ch@@ ased me and I have no doubt that what I say to them now .
but I have now arrived at the point where it does not matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will perform the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fruit levels of the trainer had been structured with the long lasting cob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led that he could throw a &quot; his license on the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ covered master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race day @-@ treatment usually &quot; ridic@@ ulous after a pack mud or sound had been applied to the ri@@ b@@ arian debate , which was b@@ umped against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has moved mud on the leg .
it could have been the night before .
it could have been the whole day before , which was something like that .
but it also had that on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this proposition was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here one went too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y strikes against ri@@ vals for cont@@ en@@ tions to ring fight
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ x of his player as the &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League Favor@@ ites .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators attached the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne B@@ enn@@ ett did a barely hide note from the Storm team , having achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two of Queensland not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were concentr@@ ating on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainer in his crew will give him confident since it was worried that they were worried , being be@@ aten from the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears on - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about audi@@ ts as she took us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have nothing changed at our defen@@ sive system or the techniques over the whole year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics at a real focus and that has provided us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . therefore , he is not likely to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is already strange , as this happens again and again at this time of year .
Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked B@@ enn@@ et idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragon won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he was compared his game on Saturday night evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team to play it and that we see as exciting , in particular his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game that you would like to play when you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now wants to play all its kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play as this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of The Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but this is an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points a bit ?
for me it is the game @-@ plans .
when they say to us , it means that in a phase we will still be able to meet .
the CM team has released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ k next Saturday evenings in the last Saturday evening in the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin from the next morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ refundable deposit on drugs
a man who is possibly a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his trial , to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were mu@@ st@@ acked to Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mar@@ ko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the federal police took 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , launched by South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and reached in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the course of the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police took 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
despite being a potentially lifel@@ ong sentence for attemp@@ ting to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ vi@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he told the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal case , he made the police over its where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father , a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security offered together to achieve its release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ al explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice F@@ agan .
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from being released , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against deser@@ tion , under the conditions that he ow@@ es its Australian and ser@@ ene pass , sign up daily with the police and adher@@ es to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A5 at Karlsruhe : leadership wealth apart
in case of a rear @-@ end , with three trucks at the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver has been badly violated at the service day .
two of the three participating trucks were slow@@ ed down before a permanent building in the direction of Bas@@ le .
the third rider noticed it too late and tried in vain , to turn in the last moment to the left , as the police assigned .
the management out of the in@@ genu@@ ity is completely apart .
the driver has been seriously wounded in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 p.m .
it was a damage worth 12@@ 2,000 euros .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used phone of girls to cur@@ l pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl , when he slept , sent to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleep ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and al@@ armed immediately their mother .
the police care about it and looked at the five images , analysed then computers which were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used concepts for search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ g@@ g then claimed to the officials that he would have done it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le in the internet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a polic@@ eman in order to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a suggestion that he may be addi@@ cted to sc@@ are people .
he gave to that the search on the computer were done by him , but said it would be done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said that he did so to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head , when he drank , and said he will then see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and in the wine .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and made the accused thereby .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused did use computer and Play@@ station to speak with girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , found guilty in the sense of indictment to have rejected un@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 last year , who had rejected this year against the stipul@@ ations and not a trial at a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defense An@@ ders S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual prosecution , since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his going .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael res@@ ur@@ ns the judgment seat to October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted a deposit in this case but in case of un@@ hear@@ ings to others still held in provisional custody .
he was added before the judgment of the judgment in the list of the sexual offen@@ ders .
tro@@ user soft for small border transfers to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up off the national control points at the Franco @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ aries made out of fear of the discovery and detention of people in smaller bor@@ dering .
on the Austrian side , there was a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police .
along the river junction , more than 1000 refugees were picked up in the coun@@ ties Pass@@ au and Rot@@ eria @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
you were walking over bridges and dust @-@ pipe on the German side by foot .

due to a deep @-@ pressure area over Western Europe rivers currently warm sea air into the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; deep lowering is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lap@@ el from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been drawn over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the mass makes &apos; s : every two years the car@@ makers show their innovations at the IA@@ A .
2015 is above all the movement on comp@@ actors , which are currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are in particular demand : about 2@@ 8,@@ 1 per cent of new appro@@ vals , fell according to the Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) only in August of this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( audience days 17th to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury vehicles , and luxury cars are presented this year primarily a lot of new compact models .
one of the biggest premium for German motor@@ ways is the Opel A@@ stra , which will be on the dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so the volume @-@ volume model is also good to be sold , the new A@@ stra also will not be much more expensive .
Opel represents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , to which first also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important cont@@ enders VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel A@@ stra initially only work as a fifth .
as a second variant will follow in the Spring of the Kom@@ bi , who is already at the IA@@ A .
and what will add to the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A still on new comp@@ actors ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of his A@@ stra @-@ competi@@ Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically sporting GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ phar@@ ma , with the new model wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti is adapting to its established lines fully into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with a capacity of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but also an diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter engine bom@@ ot@@ or and a capacity of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufactur@@ er@@ amen at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed in the model is DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IA@@ A .
outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n exhau@@ sts placed above all hand at the front part : here the cooler was newly drawn and the modified head@@ light provided with LED technology .
in the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play is integrated .
add a number of acquisitions and new versions at the IA@@ A in the comp@@ actors category as the cont@@ oured Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 3@@ 08 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ees of the former prisoners of justice , who was accommod@@ ated in one to small cell for a monthly period .
because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation , if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
sufferers can even hope for the judges if they were imprison@@ ed only a few days in the other rooms ( A@@ Z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with this it was an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell , with approximately five square meters floor ; the toilet was spacious not dis@@ connected .
after that , the man who has moved to the free foot according to his An@@ the@@ ad , in a larger cell .
his term liability is denied because of the un@@ worthy defensive conditions against the State of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dge took the judgment of the Chamber of Appe@@ al Berlin and rejected the case to re @-@ renewed test .
you see the human dignity of the man in@@ ju@@ red .
Chamber of Chamber finally decides about the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the survey time only a few days transfer days for the compensation are decisive , be an equi@@ voc@@ ally given , was it .
otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fear the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money allow@@ ance .
the constitutional rec@@ ti@@ fiers have often raised the rights of prisoners in the past .
they did not speak only in April of an in@@ mate , because he was det@@ ained naked in a cell .
in 2011 human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multi@@ f@@ ation of a cell without separate toilet .
Karlsruhe , moreover , in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court , who confirmed an in@@ mate at a parallel in November 2009 , had agreed to un@@ decent accommodation .
the then ti@@ ff was divided over three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pr@@ isons were missing in the last weeks due to missing the figures in the head@@ lines .
prisoners are therefore repeatedly included 23 hours , which aggression desc@@ ends , even to h@@ unter , was it to have come because of the tense situation .
according to information from the courts , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied by night @-@ lack of lack , 19 shall in 2016 fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seekers , according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Commerce this year , following statement by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of taking up a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create that and we can create that . &quot;
what is com@@ promised in Germany gives the following overview .
are used according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Defence ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ating the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
dramatic is the lack of living room but especially in paid for paid objects : each year 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing exp@@ out from the rental price , and around these very affordable housing will also apply refugees .
Federal Minister of Agriculture in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 thousand social housing a year must have to arise and that the federal government should invest in the amount of € 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
clearly , scientists and the Federal Chancellor agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing .
according to the estimates of the Institute of labor market and vocational research , 55 percent of the refugees can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were asked not systematically seeking their qualifications to help them start with , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but the integration of refugees is crucial to whether they find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreci@@ ating in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; says lob@@ al explor@@ er Dietrich hei@@ rs .
in Germany according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political change : from the Labor bot for refugees to recognise work .
while earlier a working ban was reduced for asylum seekers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ ables , which asylum seekers have been restricted to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , even because of the lack of qualified labour , we have succeeded in making refugees needed faster access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is the lack of German .
until now , there is no product @-@ related learning experience .
studies also show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore integration according to Thr@@ aci@@ hardt of the coron@@ ation for work integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only few refugees leave their children in the kite , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the root @-@ rooted parents , it is only once very important to hold the family together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ew@@ able , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to convince the family nonetheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators will rise heavily by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity capacity - roughly by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , pupils are being prepared at the welcome classes in the welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , even by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
to them there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ eps from the Berlin School of school .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk is estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany now want to study .
globally , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ er or memorial at the university - the only exception was so far Berlin , inside sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has placed his attitude now however .
study with refugees could become easier for the university to become a university .
for refugees with a residence permit or dem@@ ise do not receive any services after asylum seekers , when they begin studying .
the latter ones currently not get the BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ ace@@ ans .
tolerated refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible , from 1st January 2016 to 15 months .
but this gap gap has to be closed , demand for St@@ effen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lin State Secretary for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
in future , Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslim , and for many , religion is an important part of its identity .
the state should contempl@@ ate the same rights to Islam , as they have the churches and further develop the existing state @-@ churches &quot; rights to a new state @-@ religion .
important also would be the foundation of a Muslim welfare state , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights belong also to the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and put certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern , religious conflicts also could be entered into Germany as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism will also be more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination Union has been a discrimination and a general &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender equality law &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist moti@@ f systematically ignored .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ ran@@ ge@@ tic organizations and stakeholders are calling for a long time to challenge the international agreement such as anti @-@ racial evaluations in Germany , needs to remain peaceful in the coming years , when the country will remain peace@@ fully and util@@ ise its new citizens and opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , Germany is able to supply the previously anticipated refugees of medi@@ cally , says Doctor &apos;s president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ acities , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however extra money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers , equal to the registration of health modes .
services could be expected later to the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able , so many people are confronted with the limited power catalogue that pres@@ i@@ ded the asylum @-@ quality law .
otherwise , the doctors set above all the language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientists The@@ a Bor@@ de proven that migrants are more inferior to their diseases than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s practice , would need to be taken over interpre@@ ting costs .
helped for many refugees but also with more general medical targets in the emergency @-@ out@@ patient .
and with a different diagnostic view .
among refugee data about there are significantly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people go on to HIV education .
with the partly other disease pictures , German doctors came from their formation but clearly , thinks Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ bility or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and as regards the anger angel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless it becomes even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly evolved education system , and several refugees can be even doctors .
to practice them , they must show their qualifications and re @-@ v@@ ise further checks .
at least half of the refugees occurring in Germany is according to estimates of a bundle of therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically sick : most suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic recovery disorder or from depression .
particularly vulnerable , Refu@@ ge@@ inder , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee crisis is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post@@ som@@ atic load drops is suffering from other things to so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ back with breathing difficulty , ra@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death @-@ fear@@ ful .
further symptoms are sleeping and concentr@@ ations , strong sc@@ ary and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that symptoms would be chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , said Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ic patients receive a psychotherapy .
though , psych@@ ic cran@@ ial asylum seekers in the social @-@ offices may pose a request for psychotherapy but it usually takes several months .
moreover , in the soci@@ opoli@@ ters of mostly processors or doctors , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often does not lead to mal@@ anc@@ ements , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , his el@@ dest Guide , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year by a podium .
he remained in@@ firm , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the parliament was also stir@@ red by the members of the opposition that they had gotten anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe .
last month , they had held him and interrupted by his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated in the Tuesday .
the speaker of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politician SMS messages were received on their phones that they warn them before , Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ elung .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she said the title &quot; death &apos; , &quot; he told journalists by Mu@@ gab@@ it speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they warned the members of the parliamentary members that the immunity in parliament ends , and as soon as they have left the parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief spokes@@ person said , the party managed by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , &quot; was &quot; worried about the dangers for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will dismant@@ le up to 30.000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard expected to dismant@@ le 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the services of the company .
HP will later share this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer store from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service activities .
the expected job super@@ structure results in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP has said in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today is , and we have a broad portfolio of shops that assist companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as a stand@@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion dollars of annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing effective technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in order to produce Electric Fac@@ ilities and their Palo Alto Garage for the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring process to overcome the home@@ coming from traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on conviction that closely focuses companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only in September and provided his rehabilitation to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss the next four games for England and considering its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had heavily finished the last season following a separate w@@ ro@@ y violation and then back again to its old swing during the pres@@ eas@@ on .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which is not good healing .
this is not a larger affair .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his dum@@ plings or with the injuries he previously had .
this may be true from purely medical point of view , but such as Wen@@ ger is recognized , there is the related danger of further injuries , always if a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it is also developing a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ ox in the last five times .
the wider image for ar@@ senal is that they have been in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 as one of the two Premier League Club , who have recorded most of the injury stage .
L@@ ess accepts the potential of a devil @-@ circle , but ar@@ senal believed that an improvement in the injury rate will last over the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an in@@ ven@@ ous time period , a time when you strengthen your body and gain combat strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope to stabili@@ ze his body and I am confident that he will do it and he will undergo a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ ly on Monday Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia what means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Post@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it , a small relief @-@ off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal clear favour@@ ites are to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the greatest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started during the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken on Tuesday night by a earthquake , where on the reef scale 3.@@ 2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that ar@@ senal has drawn the teaching of the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains from the far hope that his management will lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never folded .
we were very close to this in 2006 but on the other hand I have long enough in the shop to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dream@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy Show , which gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever before , how to prove the murder of young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 it was the primary cause of deaths in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more frequent in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ itation @-@ Living Mission ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) will be considered the year of the man to ask the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need it .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms turned out that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his opportunities on con@@ val@@ escence in double .
for those who are not pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of spiritual friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends too , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media &apos;s guided communication , focusing on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lives have the need to appear strong , lively and successful , even though in reality the isolation is dominated .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psychologists call extr@@ ater@@ al values ; money , image , social status , everything at expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy really good .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head was placed .
every character was not defined by his labor , but by his personality , by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of jo@@ ey and ch@@ and@@ lers of hu@@ gs , moments with foot@@ steps in cozy sessions and the longing of R@@ oss to Rachel , all that came out of the knowing that men can refer to each case , even though they often withdraw , fully explore their feelings .
as a member of the phone calls it explained to me : ... &quot; my role to play with people who feel de@@ pressed and su@@ icide , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ich com@@ m thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind , if I try to offer long @-@ term stock@@ holders .
it presents clearly the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the telephone the humans in moments of despair may also help people &apos;s long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re going to sit alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone will give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mo@@ e Malmö .
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his meeting on Malmö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to visit Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept lessons as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday started .
di Maria met at less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of opportunities before they reached their advantage when Cav@@ ani made a head@@ ball up in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , the group A also needs a strong start against the Swedish master as they seek not only the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ V @-@ rounds , but an improvement in the road to the quarter @-@ fin@@ alists for each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs dep@@ ended chances in front of the gate . he was later started in the game against his home town and against the association , which he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our fo@@ es problems and look back relaxed even though there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team which was held on weekends of 2 : 2 oun@@ ces on own seat against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was out@@ stretched in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine wing was described as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was adopted at Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he finished Johan Wil@@ and ran over nicely in the long @-@ hand corner of the network .
if somebody believed that PS@@ G would win a big win , he was disappointed .
on the side of Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off suggested to reach this level , stood at An@@ du@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was s@@ ented with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the central area a severe opponent .
but besides a shot from Nikola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who ran away by Kevin Ko@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself got to , with some mis@@ led and bad deals , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was in no less than five attempts per in the first half , and then moved up after Cav@@ ani had appointed him after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he pointed out a lot more skill , when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who turned to Di Maria in a film shot , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours of the stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay Apartment achieved its sixth Se@@ as@@ tor , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had introduced a left hand side by Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back in the game , and just an excellent input from Wil@@ and from the quick@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result down before plac@@ eable E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi has reached a gate at the end .
the coach of Malmö , age Har@@ ra , later announced that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualification rounds are not rich . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays great variety in film playing
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she will not need behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday night by H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light under@@ lies the experienced actor Brown , when this the need for alternative perspectives emphasized and demonstrated in relation to a black prot@@ ag@@ onists in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , we do it in the cast of the film and not in filling the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on .
brown re@@ acted , sho@@ cked with bel@@ ated un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments from the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian appeared .
Dam@@ on and Brown closed the producing porcelain to Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ shell that is be@@ aten by her white sugar .
the producer of De@@ ar White People was made for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the Reg@@ ie &apos;s rights to the movie ; Dam@@ on re@@ bu@@ te that their reg@@ ie &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the Social Media existed prior to dis@@ approval via Dam@@ ons comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his rage on a clip by talking about &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO @-@ own@@ ing that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et has served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 sor@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ ons comments come at a time when accurate rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the Teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the motion of Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter desc@@ ended and urged legisl@@ ator and authorities , discri@@ min@@ ating practices against colour inf@@ use .
in February the voc@@ alist struck a breakdown to the movement during the introduction of the nom@@ ine@@ es albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums have still their meaning ) , &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums have still their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published a statement and in response to the issue of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth H@@ sel@@ beck if the group should be regarded as an hatred group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the guides .

so quite suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the guiding producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he ended first to the course , not just any prize money .

Detroit Tig@@ ers mu@@ gs in Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny to the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League of Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ ilers , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Tar@@ get Field .
the T@@ wins squ@@ ander@@ ed a chance to move up inside a half of Houston &apos;s office to the second American League Wild@@ card Square .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grip over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad ex@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support to keep the Detroit three times in the first two inner@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three ro@@ us .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ fighting every game , and therefore I want to go down completely concentrated in the game .
the design@@ ate tiger @-@ bracket Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches and was available in two rat , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits at Seattle Nav@@ al on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has caught the ben@@ ds good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said pri@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( percussion ) , looked significantly better at the bull@@ tro@@ pics , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh month , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game again .
center Fiel@@ d@@ Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton pushed the inning room with a double on the left field @-@ line .
Right Fiel@@ ding Aaron H@@ icks did a spell , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier , before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran over to the only man , the only man with whom he was confronted with the des@@ ig@@ matic R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drums Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ apped a two @-@ run at the right @-@ handed over @-@ head .
with a pair of buyers and the finish @-@ run at the second brought Ver@@ hagen the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the major player &apos;s major league in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe making a Double Play
after Detroit added to an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth @-@ stop , it creates an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ro@@ don and recorded the level of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed rope of S@@ ano at three pitch for its fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited for the opening of the game from an even not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers made three R@@ uns in the first two of the Interior against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an who had been rep@@ ain@@ ted before the game by the viol@@ a list , having had more than one month ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning which I have wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I learned and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches here in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single of Second Co@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z launched Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z Play in the game , who created a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed its 0 @-@ 21 track record with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single hand at the right , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game , when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers inserted in the second to get a One @-@ Out Double from Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ding Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he was not particularly well be@@ aten , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , no points generated in the third inning , before being replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver racks @-@ J.@@ A@@ chter@@ le .
in Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ Us in six hits and a walk with four cor@@ ke@@ outs .

the director of the Munich Conference , Wolfgang Früh@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the more deci@@ de@@ dly thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave a collective look of the European states . &quot;
four years ago it was happy that the cup of military participation to Germany has gone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict has been cr@@ ashing from our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU &apos;s interior ministers intend to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting on binding distribution of other 120 000 refugees .
given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in initial recording and distribution of the people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late evening evening after almost four talks with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor at the Chancellor in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ score , those people , the protection of believers , too com@@ promised this too .
but who did not have a bal@@ lot perspective , could not remain in Germany too .
this view was expressed in the round impressive .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge strength of strength . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of des@@ perate refugees are now stuck on the bal@@ kan@@ route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia during the night of Tuesday .

the Romanian government condemned the plan to immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ goes contain much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but whoever wants to take care of his slim line will often fall out of them rather .
because Man@@ gos are relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy are the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them put B @-@ vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Be@@ fore all contain man@@ goes but plenty of vitamin A and its pre@@ level beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
who e@@ ats the fruits , therefore supports se@@ ers , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant .
the form@@ work color alone does not say anything about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be kept at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then taste it of course pure or in sweet meals .

Rome has now a Martin Luther &apos;s place
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of Stadt@@ president Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday an up @-@ to @-@ date square in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was baptised on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming has been filed by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live as a minority often only in secret their faith .
with the place I become visible in a means that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he perceived the city back then as a stat@@ ute .
his negative impressions also thir@@ st him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther has then initiated his theses of the breakdown of the domestic Church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for the Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and the Bible texts updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which is now published with fine pictures .
in the beginning , the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Alt who formulated his completely personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has got the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the respective subjects adapted , it can quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible @-@ project has worked for which he made a subjective and artistic choice from the many areas of the &quot; book &quot; of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
created cycles that devote themselves issues like cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land .
hence he immediately fascinated several partners : the applies to the Luther editor with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art@@ books .
and since the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who tac@@ kl@@ ed himself on the basis of painting with the respective Bible sets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible , translated by Ot@@ mar into the Bible and so into today , into current cor@@ relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible rental of Martin Luther and each one sentence of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry band has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high degree of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who stopped to the strict Protestant king order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education came already with the tube , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls al@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work out that maybe also to carry me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art of faster in a faster time : &quot; the perception of cap@@ tions is today shaped by re@@ kl@@ ame , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is there being pushed .
artists have another desire and rejo@@ icing , things to show .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers come into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them act in themselves and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its counter@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not hear@@ k@@ able to grasp the Bible completely but also chosen mysterious issues for him as well .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains merely . &quot; was a painting Bible .
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to deepen his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas Pr@@ ints - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , company instru@@ cted to model ground@@ ing for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail it was the conclusion .
failures in policy and administration have shelter for em@@ bedding , especially in the residents who do not tolerate the railway .
thus top up , new place sought - now with the formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will enter in October , the first community of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now disclosed in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started without a &quot; more memorial &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensified work for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundesliga is a clear sign in the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the tense situation in Germany and secur@@ es the policy its help in tackling the problems of the coming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle that is not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that has to be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet the state of government ministers W@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly be a key role playing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive cros@@ sover must have the policy .
the German Football Association therefore broad@@ casts a refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we ensured that this programme is going to 2019 until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also some Federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 label will expose a significant sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ mel instead of the otherwise usual sponsorship contract ( Her@@ mes ) the print of &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lever@@ ano &apos;s sports@@ club of Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ aining &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes every one , no one cannot see &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we would like to football @-@ bear@@ ers , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ open@@ hei@@ ms Director Peter Ret@@ ard@@ ly spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
for the EM @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach was awarded the support of refugees as a &quot; large joint work &quot; of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements have had their own projects in their own locations , be great .
equally great is that small and smallest associations are active since .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year the association will provide € 300 000 for the integration of refugees in the next year , with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; the clubs can already be called for 2015 , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach .

Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t com@@ mu@@ te usually between Germany and the USA , but since summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again when you go down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the forced statement by fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the final step was to be the target for the B@@ B in the Europe League , Medi@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehensible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the leading role in Germany
Germany must be fron@@ trun@@ ner according to the will of the federal government at the change of the car technology .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) which provides investments into the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the autom@@ aker IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility &quot; age . &quot;
the automated and networked drive will increase traffic safety and ensure less steel , she said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states together with representatives of the industry .
the Concept Paper of the Tourism Department emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band distribution and a fast moving on digital broad@@ casting .
the testing of new technology currently develops a test circuit on the 9 of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to allow the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in such a way Germany does not want to use internationally recognised that the permitted peak speed is raised for self @-@ driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the German government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention which now only sees the human being as a driver .
when automated driving takes the car , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that collect the environment and process data within seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the cars to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving capabilities in Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital connectivity of the p@@ to@@ v can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ soci@@ ologist S@@ ören Bart@@ ol .
the question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clari@@ fied however .
however the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
one on Wednesday on the AA Director of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the EU@@ T @-@ Institute on behalf of the EU@@ re@@ organization DE@@ K@@ RA is coming to the result , that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will succeed in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in this 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it .
in France 21 percent of the surv@@ eyed cars are expected to be driven by aut@@ om @-@ cars by 20@@ 25 , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on the vehicle &apos;s self @-@ driving vehicle .
according to a collection of the digital association Bit@@ k@@ om , only seven percent would be able to agree to take control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway , this could simultaneously be 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 per cent .
good every fourth would leave under control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wanted to fight only in sol@@ itary state with the title &quot; from 25 September to 4 October . &quot;
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Tim@@ o , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bas@@ razor Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ le during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was in this time on the flight to a long @-@ term contract for sponsor@@ ing in China at this time .
the 34 year old German Master is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Tim@@ o is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained single Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ am@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ist in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , he reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ fli@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Tim@@ o was also missing , and we have become Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we should come to ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; explained to the world @-@ tran@@ e @-@ fifth .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ing : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : showcase man@@ nequins , which look thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who was among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as Stage out@@ fits for the great star of the fashion scene - and therefore he put some men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say today I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Civil side@@ walk ) , which is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle in the H@@ Y@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pfer has changed his initially refused stance to a spectacle over his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he would have been on the contrary , for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition is a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , one gets into the museum .
the impressive collection had already been in Montreal in the Canadian and Paris station .
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger Di@@ e@@ whose .
it is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hard work of the man , written in fashion , without ever having an education .
chron@@ ologically the presentation is not built , but it is an excellent choreo@@ graphic total work , which has been operated for much effort : to fres@@ ze the dolls , for example a sty@@ list is engaged .
14 tons of material have mat@@ ted the creators to the statements of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest it was a special treat : a le@@ ased out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ utes &apos; Ted@@ dy is in the exhibition to see .
he stands for the first , tender mo@@ o@@ bedience of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy Be@@ ads and clothes , he said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dis@@ ing of fashion has he approached later on .
he sto@@ le fashi@@ on@@ als and saw himself the designs of other designer , as Gau@@ l@@ tier was telling in Munich .
but later I bought it of course .
for his first own fashion , he did not have to pay the mod@@ alities .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the gear .
jewelry instead of sheer - Pl@@ au@@ ener top as fashion @-@ niche
earlier , it went on the long nitrogen @-@ presses in and around it to do meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were produced in great deal for customers , for example they further developed for blankets and she@@ ers .
the alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the ra@@ yon Slots Pl@@ auen .
instead the mode is again important .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener top mode , fashion played a major role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and for regional trades .
at all Bil@@ de the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which leans towards past bull@@ le@@ po@@ ets , an increasing of the potential to become potential .
those who are not in the textile industry in Germany are no longer served in the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ ert@@ ank Pl@@ auen is along with nine further companies member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they are allowed to bear the protected label .
around 80 percent of sales have been cut off in the last 15 years .
private dealers and also the wholesale W@@ hol@@ es@@ ale there is almost no more .
our products are hardly reaching the client in this way .
the mass goods today become much cheaper in the Asian region and distributed almost exclusively via chains .
also weak@@ s the export , current after Russia and in the USA .
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association tries also to score points of environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the nitrogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we run a quality seal that shows that we are ec@@ ologically and socially detri@@ mental . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma @-@ designed U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Se@@ eberger outer place of the West@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische School Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , which above all need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design can often only be varied , in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago made textile design Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historic Snow @-@ tip new .
the machine har@@ ps the machine on some places small ch@@ icks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ li chose : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could start anything with a traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the sn@@ ails for her jewelry .
in an elaborate process they shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the issue of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - young and old &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who want to have a reminder .
as a result , I see my jewelry as the modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film

here it goes according to &quot; entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , not to a re @-@ profile , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical n@@ anny .
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family Banks in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy broader for the world
the economy has to open itself broader to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi J@@ in@@ ping on the Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; China should devote themselves to improving foreign investment and expertise and improve the strategies for business @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the central management group to deepen a comprehensive reform .
new start @-@ ups and reform will drive new momentum and vitality , and offering new space for economic growth , said Xi .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list of regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls @-@ policies , promoting the border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local &apos;s immune system .
after the statement , a negative list will be created , which sectors and companies identified , which will not be questioned for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is crucial since it as@@ signs the market a major role in the allocation of resources , which ensures a law firm operating environment and open the market more open , said the statement .
the government is also vali@@ dated controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure that businesses decide how to conduct its operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also stated that China allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economy cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of an offer , which controlled sectors will open , additional areas for private investments are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy against foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; that facilitates the requirements and the application process will be facilitated .
the law of lawyers to guarantee their work , and to deplo@@ y professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting was published .
EU wants to double quot@@ a limit value in car@@ y@@ fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and allow consumers to cope with a significantly higher dose of nervous system .
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is an appropriate employer by the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side effects inf@@ alli@@ zed industries and environmental policies are passed on with full force of sw@@ ang@@ ere and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt predicted the limits for large fish at the end of the food chain for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ pen@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish in &quot; economic reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram fish .
large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , however , may already be so strongly charged with mer@@ cury , that at the basis of the current limits , approximately 50 per cent of the deposits are not allowed to be sold .
after the dou@@ bling of the threshold , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this lo@@ osen the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the threshold values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram on 0.1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram .
F@@ ood@@ watch has done this however as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , as many car@@ p usually are so low charged that they are already making the planned high @-@ levels already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sen@@ sing at Kl@@ einf@@ ally is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy of distr@@ action that helps alone the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is a very high @-@ state @-@ metal @-@ metal @-@ metal , which enri@@ ches himself above the food chain mainly in car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es .
the German government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; already small quantities are particularly cause in inf@@ ants of the nervous system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Department of Commerce explains its homepage with regard to the current high@@ s , but that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cannot be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mercury is above all due to coal burning in the environment .
the German coal fired power station proce@@ eded according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Commerce to the Green Bundestag on the Green Bundestag Mor@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total population of Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warnings before mer@@ cury in fish already been among the most common reported health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
