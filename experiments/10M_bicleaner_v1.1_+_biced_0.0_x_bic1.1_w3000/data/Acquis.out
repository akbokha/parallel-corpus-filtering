purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure in implementing the section I on the securing measures as required .
the aim of securing measures specified in this agreement is the tim@@ ely discovery of demo@@ lition of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ heads for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a decrease due to the risk of premature discovery .
for the purpose of the target set in Article 28 , the material accounting for a securing of fundamental importance , composite with spatial intervention and observation as important supple@@ mentary measures , is used .
the technical conclusion of checking through the organization takes place through an explanation , in which for each material de@@ bug zone , which is not listed for a specific period of material that is listed below the accuracy of accuracy .
in carrying out their investigations , the organisation according to Article 3 makes full use of ensuring the community &apos;s security system .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material bil@@ let zones .
when applying its securing measures , the community will make use of the process and measures within the following manner : and , as far as required , proceed as they are closer and practical purposes are :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of recur@@ sive , her@@ edit@@ ary , lost , lost or any other way from the stock of kern@@ els and the stock levels ;
B ) evalu@@ ating the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement in@@ security ;
C ) Det@@ er@@ mining , assessment and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
e ) Proce@@ dures for evaluation of accumulation not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol , and reporting system , which indicates the core material of material and changes in the scope of material including the one - and outputs of the material bil@@ t@@ ance zone ;
g ) Pre@@ ferences that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Proce@@ dures to refund reports about the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this agreement does not extend to material in mining or in the arch@@ preparation process .
B ) is ur@@ anium ( or th@@ ori@@ um@@ eric material which , which , under letter c ) , described the phase of the core burning cycle that has not yet been introduced in states , so the organization of the organization is introduced , provided that it is not introduced to specific non nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves kern@@ els , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or is@@ ot@@ open@@ an@@ enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase , in which it is produced , or will be introduced in a later phase of the core of the core cycle in the States , so it is subject to the other in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards agreed in this Convention will not termin@@ ate in Article 11 . the community , however , is the opinion that the recovery of nuclear materials , which is subject to safegu@@ ards for this agreement is not possible or requested , so consult the organisation and fellowship with each other on the application of appropriate safety measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards agreed in this Convention are closed for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , unless the organization and community agreed to be con@@ sensual , that this core material is practically non @-@ profit .
at the request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following key material from the securing measures after this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material , if it is used in gram or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ;

C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , that is over 80 % .
in seeking the community fre@@ es the organization &apos;s core material that would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards after this agreement , as far as the whole , because of this article in the States freed core material at no time more than
a ) a total of very p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) U@@ ran with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) U@@ ran with a enrich@@ ment that is under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran can be calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight by the five @-@ day square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural uran and completed ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons rounded off with a enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or less ;
if the core material should be processed together with nuclear materials , which is subject to safegu@@ ards following this agreement , processed or stored , precau@@ tions are taken on that material .
the community meets the organisation of supple@@ mentary ad@@ missions , which is necessary in the circum@@ ference , which is necessary for the successful and effective path@@ way of the organisation according to this agreement , in particular determine how to apply in the procedure specified .

furthermore , in order to simpli@@ fy the procedure for adju@@ sting the z@@ oll@@ arized demand in case of the customs tariff of one of the Parties in the future , it appears to be shown in an article 12 to record .
I ad@@ ore myself to confirm the agreement of the Community at these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entering the 1 January 1978 .
I would appreciate you , if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I ad@@ ore myself to confirm the input of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be thank@@ ful to you if you would confirm the approval of your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter @-@ changing between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of member states in the framework of the medium @-@ term financial crisis
the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tors , when banks issue a corresponding application .
the agreements could be closed up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , and within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion billing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of the future deploy@@ ments of the member countries .
but now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , whose application would be the BIS .
at each stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially take up a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions continu@@ ances , without having exceeded five years .
at the opening of the credits as well as with its extension , the BIS would charge a credit rating commission .
in addition , it would have agreed that the first draw is not taken before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can take the necessary adjust@@ ments to their own liqui@@ dity .
the drawing would be made in the currencies available in the BI@@ Z agreements , probably in US dollars ; they would have extended periods of time , taking into consideration the means of the Bank , is expected to be three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BIS turn on under similar circumstances , that means interest rates would correspond to the market rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the BIS needs to achieve the required funds , however , the next interest rate may reach a maximum , which is equivalent to a corresponding margin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would be grateful for you if you would send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tors , when banks issue a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a reag@@ ent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g the antibody , or any other ingredient .
if a reag@@ ent is used by the manufacturer recommended , the following factors or phenomena may not appear : a ) ha@@ em@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the Tit@@ er is measured in a suitable medium by always ren@@ ew the di@@ lution of the examined re@@ ag@@ ility .
the title is the correct value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um@@ ulation , in which a reaction appears ; the di@@ lution will only be calculated by the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on objects , the activity is expressed by the time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has been set for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ D as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination International Standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity will be worked out at the time of standards .
a International standard prepar@@ atory contains according to definition a certain number of international units per mg or ml ; and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in single preparations for red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ary arter@@ ies that is observed in a series of th@@ inner at a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ ten@@ tion .

if a reag@@ ent is stored under the manufacturer recommended conditions , its required properties will remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent form according to label is only one year after the last satisfactory efficacy tests .
based on the label exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agen@@ icia , based on results of re@@ ten@@ tion tests , it is appro@@ ve from state regulatory authorities .
drying reag@@ ents are kept in a atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass container that they have been dried , and that is so closed that no moisture may enter .
a dry re@@ acting may not lose the 0.5 b.@@ H. its weight if it is tested in a pressure of more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg for a pressure of more than 0.0@@ 2 mm Hg for 24 hours .
to avoid bacterial growth , the state @-@ state authorities can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , as far as the reag@@ ent substance continued its requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin of blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
the reag@@ ents , in@@ different , whether in flu@@ ent form or after recovery , must be transparent and may contain neither se@@ di@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the evidence for the international exchange of certain reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination should be om@@ itted as if possible , at least as long as an international agreement has come about a unified system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are in such a way and in such quantities , that this is not only possible to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount must be so big in a container that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the laboratory @-@ laboratory has over all levels of production and controls of reag@@ ents for blood @-@ group determination .
appropriate samples of all the reag@@ ents are so long from the laboratory of laboratory , until with some lik@@ el@@ ihood is assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the reag@@ ents used for blood group determination can contain substances such as human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to ampli@@ fy the efficacy and preservation of the reag@@ ents .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are classified according to the origin of their actual share in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents are not able to contain substances of human origin .
each single box is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following data : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the required liquid to be needed ,
also , this label , or the label on the box , in which the individual containers are located , or which contained the containers enclosed instruction manual : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . the amount or , in dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the required liquid to be needed ,
each show is a certificate of certification according to Article 4 of the Convention on the protocol to add to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of the group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B . it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ans no human red blood cells containing no A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood @-@ groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison of water disper@@ sing A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells .
in no case the effectiveness of the server must be less than 64 International units per ml .
if the anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent absorption of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination is supposed to be carried out within a double time that is required , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ A blood group or standard pre@@ par@@ at of same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of the group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood @-@ groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison of B blood cells .
if the anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent absorption of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within a double time that is necessary , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard pre@@ par@@ at of same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is extracted from the blood of the group 0 , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gene A and / or B , i.e. those of group A , including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ in@@ u@@ gens A or B , i.e. those of the group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are not ag@@ itated in the general by anti @-@ A serum for blood don@@ ors of the group B ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison point , separated against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
furthermore , it is parallel to the un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison of B blood cells to tap .
in no case the effectiveness of the server must be less than 64 International units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause a slightly recogni@@ zable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ % floo@@ ding from A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be carried out within a double period of age , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard prepar@@ atory of same activity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum for an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent absorption of B blood cells are mixed , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within a double time that is necessary , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a standard pre@@ par@@ at of same Avi@@ dity .
if an anti @-@ A + A anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent cut blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 Â ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera each speci@@ f@@ ity can be one of two types , which differ by the pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ites , under which a ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
with others , which are called &quot; in@@ complete &quot; , ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with presence of specific col@@ lo@@ ids such as herd alb@@ um@@ in or with other special methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sera ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also concerns hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the evaluation of the Sera Det@@ er@@ min@@ ation of the R@@ h Group may possibly change if International standard preparations are available . i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , immun@@ ised by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Sera must have a title of at least 1 : 32 compared to c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent boiling water solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a &quot; in@@ complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the un@@ solved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of the in@@ complete anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison of c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells .
in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum is to react with blood cells , the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Sera , which are intended to use object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , have to be mixed with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ % absorption of c@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells , within 30 seconds of a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C @-@ an@@ tigen .
this Sera is therefore specific to the C @-@ tigen only then specifically , if the tested blood cells are pushed in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent boiling solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the title of the Anti @-@ C Sera ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 vs. C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ C Sera , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must be mixed if they are mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 40@@ - to 50@@ % absorption of C@@ cd@@ de@@ e blood cells within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ E serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people , immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen E of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Sera ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a title of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Sera , which are intended to use object carriers according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in any form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed if they have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + E can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time .
if an serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period is intended for all types of red blood cells , which indicate a reaction , not less than with the ant@@ aneous antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen that is called those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain any A @-@ an@@ tigen that is called those of the blood @-@ groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison , separated by A1 , A2 and A@@ 2B red blood cells ( 1 ) .
if the anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent absorption of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be carried out if the same attempt is performed with the repeated , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ A blood group or standard pre@@ par@@ at of same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of blood group B .
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , that means those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates no human red blood cells that contain no B an@@ tigen , that means those of blood @-@ groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the recur@@ ring , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison of blood cells to type B ( 1 ) .
if the anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent absorption of B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to occur within a double time that is necessary , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard prepar@@ par@@ ate of the anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard pre@@ par@@ at of same Avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum for use in the blood group ser@@ ology must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against comple@@ mentary factors .
it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum .
if it is used according to the manufacturer , so ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates it no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , equivalent to which blood group they belong .

anti @-@ A reag@@ ent is obtained by extrac@@ ting seeds or other parts of a suitable plant , where appropriate cleaning is made .
the anti @-@ A reag@@ ent ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ anti@@ gens , that means those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1B and A@@ 2B ; it is not a human @-@ red blood cells that contain any A @-@ an@@ tigen that is called those of the blood @-@ groups 0 and B .
an anti @-@ A reag@@ ent is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard par@@ par@@ ate of anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding comparison par@@ agus , separated against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells ( 1 ) .
the effectiveness of the reag@@ ent may not be less than 64 International units per ml .
if the anti @-@ A reag@@ ent is mixed on an object bearing with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10@@ 70 @-@ blood flow of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination has to be carried out in a double time , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard pre@@ par@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity . ii ) anti @-@ B blood group re@@ acting ( veget@@ al )
anti @-@ B reag@@ ent is obtained by extrac@@ ting the appropriate part of an appropriate plant and , where appropriate cleaning is made .
