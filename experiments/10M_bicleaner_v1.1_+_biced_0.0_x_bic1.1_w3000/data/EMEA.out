it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injec@@ tion@@ able injec@@ tions ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Sho@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and ins@@ ulations ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal clusters ) have altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood .
in general , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat medium @-@ severe panic episodes and to prevent Man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection solution is used for fast control of controlled ag@@ itation or behavi@@ oral disorders if the oral medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or melting the melting tablets , which the swal@@ lowing of tablets has been prepared .
patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but lower than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since d@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic symptoms and ret@@ inal diseases .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the re @-@ appear symptoms , was investigated in three studies over a year .
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours compared to placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in another study on 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in another study to prevent the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was carried out in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , who suffered at increased rest@@ lessness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change of patients in patients were examined using a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake ( up ) .
in both studies involving the injection solution showed patients who received N@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased turbul@@ ence than patients who received a placebo .
in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was reduced in four of the five short @-@ time studies of some symptoms more effective than placebo .
in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy was more effective than placebo perceived to be more effective than placebo in previously treated patients and if it was additionally given to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy injec@@ tions were reduced in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses , also more effective than placebo perceived the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( constant motion ) , headache , water secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ical episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes , with whom the man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole expressed in comparison to the risks .
furthermore , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of controlled anxiety and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ polar episodes in case of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted an auth@@ orization for the company Ot@@ p@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily , regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder treatment was not detected at 65 years .
with regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justi@@ fies this . ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the onset or after change of anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , including the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder had no increased view@@ points with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ought to be applied for patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , con@@ ges@@ tion disease ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , cereb@@ ral failure ( dehy@@ d@@ ration , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure reduction drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sent@@ ery : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there was occasional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sent@@ in@@ ence , should be drawn up to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient developed signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
thus , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the history of history , with sei@@ zu@@ res in connection with the sei@@ zu@@ res .
56 - 99 years old ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole came to placebo compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to undes@@ i@@ rov@@ astic events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients .
hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , while weight gain is observed and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system is advis@@ able when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole combined with alcohol or other centr@@ alised pharmac@@ euticals in combination with alcohol or other central effects ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is irrelevant as clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore ought to be carried out similar dose reductions .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism can use the common application using high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , must have similar effects and therefore ought to be carried out similar dose reductions .
based on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ ish@@ öhe before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ u@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ om@@ orph@@ an ) .
the patients should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to inadequate data protection for the human being and due to the resulting data protection studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of dangerous engines , including power vehicles , to use until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative effect on them .
the following side effects were common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , D@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ingrad , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was diagnosed in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % were treated in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under Lithium Treatment .
in long @-@ term testing phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo which occurred potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the adverse events that can appear in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ mium mag@@ icians , and sei@@ zu@@ res , un@@ wanted les@@ rov@@ astic events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ do@@ si@@ tions were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without any death sequence .
there are no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . however , it is unlikely to use ha@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in treating a non @-@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma binding .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on Dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- receptor and a ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to the d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and for hist@@ amine @-@ H1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 up to 30 m@@ g. a daily dose of healthy volunteers showed a dos@@ isation of dos@@ ages of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a half of the Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol controlled trial , 52 of the proportion of the Respon@@ ses who attended study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measuring values defined as secondary study , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depression @-@ scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than on Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed significantly higher reduction of decl@@ ines which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study included in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca . 5.6 kg ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies with more flexible dose of 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks to placebo .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therapies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over placebo which was comparable to placebo or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed 12 a comparable share of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing the symptoms of reducing bacterial symptoms with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole due to placebo on the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se .
based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ d@@ ration and hydro@@ xy@@ fication of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is about 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and about almost 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients had no sexually dependent effects .
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for fast check of as@@ gi@@ ants and behavi@@ ors in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
when it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injec@@ tions should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and to minim@@ ize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle under env@@ ying of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were used earlier a anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who had conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
considered to be considered the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer patients , as much as time until deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival of the disease .
in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it must also not be used in patients who have breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neutral density numbers in the blood .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was containing more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines in which the first treatment must not be given more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs with other drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited to offer Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neutral number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy , during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy 3 is the treatment to inter@@ rupt until the improvement is reached 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced to any subsequent cycles .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with un@@ affected kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dose custom@@ iz@@ ations in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could be essentially other pharmac@@ ological features as other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and treatment of symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be diver@@ ted until the neutral number has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while clearly Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been detected in relation to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardiac dents in the inde@@ xed patient collective was not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or under@@ lying heart or lung disease .
in case of patients following the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rhoea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ e@@ tika and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive funds .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant or pregnant women , who do not practice an effective conception , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in working age should apply for a reliable reference method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child will testify .
male patients should have advised against treatment on a sper@@ mac@@ ular preservation , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane has the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and dizziness ( often ) that can affect the traffic jams and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study of all three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity ( 79 % of the patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side @-@ effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the co@@ generation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tubes inde@@ xes and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in , convey@@ s in the endo@@ theli@@ al components in the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in developed by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ rec@@ ept@@ or and based on the in@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sp@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tum@@ ors occurs .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two alone @-@ blind@@ ed studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
during inclusion in the study 64 % of patients had a common condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy alone , 27 % had only a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % because of metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 . the results for the general response rate and time up to progression free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are presented below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity vs. pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy for periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy 3 .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy for qu@@ itting on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active ingredient ( AU@@ C ) increased more linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration to multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or turn@@ out of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solv@@ ent @-@ quality pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and fabric coating , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily related to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the mean value of cum@@ ulative stim@@ ulation 4 % of the overall dose with less than 1 % of the total metabolism of 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
patients at the age of more than 75 years , however , only few data are available , since only 3 patients in this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and above light light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic @-@ carcin@@ ogenic drug , and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be maintained with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chloride in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected in a Abra@@ x@@ ane cli@@ pping bottle .
after complete addition , the solution should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good use of solid material .
then the bottle @-@ bottle should be slow to at least 2 minutes and cau@@ ti@@ ously and / or inver@@ ted , until a complete reset board of the powder is carried out .

• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the Charac@@ ter@@ istics of Product ( Technical information ) , labelling and packaging design . • A unique image representation of the correct use of the product is used for transport through patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and also includes the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medication &quot; ) .
patients with normal blood flow values may be used in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case of surgery a self @-@ bleeding is not possible and in which a blood @-@ loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed has to be conducted under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to have a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ eg@@ i@@ ver , provided that they have an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and patients who receive chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ ite values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite during adults and 11 g / dl of children ) .
the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be given for the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or patients with kidney problems may be a an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or caused that the body does not sufficiently concern the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with an injection of 4@@ 79 patients receiving kidney problems caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all those participating in this study was inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected in a v@@ ein before they were either transferred to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ite values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
in addition , the company also laid the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was studied with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ ite values of patients , which were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to this , the patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , side winding , headache , and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injec@@ tions under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that these are caused by allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that it has been provided for ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will be provided for medical specialists in all Member States of information , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a approval for the transport of ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .

treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or in@@ sufficient for the required larger operational surgery ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
as a result of a foreign orthop@@ edic treatment , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in an adult orthop@@ a@@ edic treatment in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion applications can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood @-@ loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) .
angi@@ ography symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease status is required by the doctor .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients may occasionally be observed with individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ ite values above or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bi@@ vari@@ ability , about a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ite value increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ ine value 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) exceeds the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa dose by 25 % .
patients should be supervised in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
starting dose 50 kg / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose of 25 % / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be at least 4 weeks in incre@@ ments ) .
angi@@ ography symptoms and - follow @-@ up phenomena can be different depending on age , gender , and overall disease @-@ load ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease status is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bi@@ vari@@ ability , about a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mol / l ) .
patients should be supervised in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the symptoms of angi@@ ble symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ um value increased at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the vertical number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , the dose of 150 @-@ kg / kg should be maintained a week or 450 kg / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the vertical number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 mg / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 g / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ um increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the tap count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 g / kg should be retained three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ite value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the prec@@ lu@@ u@@ lo@@ ot count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the initial value , an appeal to the ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be ab@@ orted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the prescribed deposits of ≥ 4 blood conserv@@ atives is required , de@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before operating surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood flow program - started to be available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy of large iron reserves .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 g / kg ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week of three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and day of surgery ( Day 0 ) .
ep@@ ic@@ ec@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 of a / kg each with 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards .

ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurr@@ ence of an an@@ tic@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden re@@ loss , defined as a reduction of trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reproductive value should be investigated and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fol@@ li@@ cles , or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminum loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .

if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must minim@@ ize the risk of potential thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ y@@ able an@@ emia - dose adjustable between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk @-@ risk of involvement in the respective patient who should consider the specific clinical context .
in patients who are ear@@ marked for a bigger type of orthop@@ edic treatment , if possible , before the start of the ep@@ her@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia were examined and treated accordingly .
patients who have under@@ gone a bigger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic treatment , should have an adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have increased risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in a basic cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded that treatment with ep@@ her@@ ine al@@ fa for patients with a source @-@ f@@ og@@ lob@@ ite value of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of increased risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events .
in several controlled studies , ep@@ et@@ ine was not demonstrated that they improve survival patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduced the risk of tumor growth .

during the treatment with se@@ amed , it may occur within the norm range to an easy dos@@ ing @-@ dependent increase of blood vessels , which is re@@ construc@@ ting further treatment .
your doctor will enable regular blood tests to help control the number of blood vessels during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , resolution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fol@@ li@@ cles should be taken into account and treated before the beginning of therapy with se@@ wage treatment .
very rare was reported on the occurr@@ ence of an an@@ tic@@ ular ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin inj@@ ected ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with de@@ se@@ amed and set as your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed will be given into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated due to a an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ite value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the death of death could be increased .
in increased or increasing potassium , your doctor may consider a dis@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ amed into account until the potassium values lie back in the normal range .
if you suffer chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or dust signs by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror will not exceed a certain value .
following the present time of this detection is caused by the treatment of blood im@@ pover@@ ishment in adults with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) that are not di@@ aly@@ zed for progression of kidney failure .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of efficacy of se@@ wage .
200 your physician will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your billing dose accordingly , to keep the risk of blood muscle formation ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as possible .
this risk should be carefully balanced in the treatment with Epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are ob@@ ese ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if you have already occurred with thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ tic@@ ism or lung em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed sounds like a growth factor for blood cells and may affect the tumor in certain circumstances .
if a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment was investigated before treatment with de@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ emia and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood @-@ color ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of blood vessels after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists when you use other medicines / apply or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor will commit certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM CS@@ F are funds to build the immune system , for example in cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood pressure ( an@@ a@@ emia ) is attached to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check and make sure the medicine works correctly and your Hä@@ mo@@ Bell bin@@ ar will not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 kg / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large injec@@ tions .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • O@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have suffered a little trau@@ matic hips like falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease which changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by injection in a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain , and headache .
for the treatment of mor@@ dial Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , was a part of the data material for zom@@ eta for the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years , which had suffered a hip frac@@ ture . the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in total 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase were removed in the blood ( an enzyme , bone substance ) in the blood again , or by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo by 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures were reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ ction ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients receiving placebo ( 139 out of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as in all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ o@@ arthritis ( die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw@@ s .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians to use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , as well as the similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug may be explained and pointed out , when they should turn to the doctor .

the patient &apos;s information package should be provided , and the following core messages include : • The package of contrac@@ tual activity in pregnancy and lact@@ ating women • Re@@ quired physical activity , non @-@ smoking and healthy eating • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When in medical or nursing help .
treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hips .
for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of mor@@ dial Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed by doctors that have experience in the treatment of mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was observed in patients receiving therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very wise to ensure patient suffering with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , may be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patient &apos;s group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients is similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended to use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data is missing and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
a pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated at the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic on the bone structure , a temporary f@@ yl@@ ing hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very wise to ensure patient suffering with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be carried out prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a tooth inspection with appropriate prevent@@ ative dental treatment .
for patients who require dental boxes , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the ja@@ w area .
clinical assessment by the treat doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual @-@ benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days of administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse adverse events reported by pre@@ judi@@ ci@@ ble cases was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , overall incidence of anticip@@ ation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ wanted drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ hal@@ ic was associated with kidney function , which is expressed as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cancer ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the onset of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were in a clinical study of o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cancer within 10 days after the gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium @-@ values showed that in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirrors have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a major clinical study has been reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion scheme , as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the ja@@ w area , mainly in cancer patients , above o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the ja@@ w area ) reports that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid , were treated .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including O@@ ste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental entries .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined forces in the ja@@ w area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and treated with placebo .
in case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be achieved through the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once per year has been found in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter or a BM@@ D @-@ T Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ one frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ological spine A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sen@@ ed significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a permanent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of net frac@@ tures at 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total hips of 6.0 % , the cran@@ berries around 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis in patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were collected a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vis Bay .
a micro @-@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase of frac@@ tory bone volumes and the receipt of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ ker @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 of oral or intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
impact on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total weight and scra@@ per as at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led to placebo for 24 months to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total weight and by 4.3 % on the scra@@ per .
clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon R@@ FT study were random@@ ized , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to demonstrate a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was referred to as compared to the weekly gift of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at relative to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get des Kno@@ las A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years , especially light up to moderately severe mor@@ bus Pa@@ get in the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ) according to 2,@@ 6@@ fold ( ranging from age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six month compar@@ ative studies .
in the combination of the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief was observed compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ses at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with risk @-@ treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic address given at 141 of patients treated with a@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients suffer from an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes permanent in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ hable .
after that , the plasma bar decreased rapidly at &lt; 10 % of peak value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0,1 % of the peak .
fast @-@ phase disappearance of the large circulation system with half @-@ half hours t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a period of elimination bracket for ½ hours of ½ hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the recommended dose in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the cell aci@@ dic acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ zent@@ ration at time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by using cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems metabolic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metabolic and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it turns out that a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a medium kidney function until down to a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid requires .

abstract of EP@@ AR to the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Human@@ itarian S@@ elec@@ tor ( CH@@ MP ) will be evaluated in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
additionally , it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) that can not be satis@@ fying with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fa drugs or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fa drugs or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ fa drugs or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
for more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fa drugs , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for 3.5 years .
in studies the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value which suggests that the blood sugar levels of dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of an additional gift of Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fa drugs in a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional treatment of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased , compared with 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to placebo compared to placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were bl@@ ur@@ red vision , infections of upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be applied in patients that are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ ones - inf@@ rin@@ gement - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in some use ) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where metal does not appear .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , ar@@ ched and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , their blood sugar with insulin inadequate and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate for contra@@ indications or toler@@ ability ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , a physician should commen@@ ce treatment with the lowest dose , and increase the dose of continuously increasing dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , or ede@@ ma , especially those with a reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirror reaches up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzy@@ matic values are as soon as possible to control .
in case a patient symptoms are designed to refer to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , upper stomach pains , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ matic values .
the decision whether the treatment of the patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on continued , should be led by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ isation weight gain has been detected , which can stir in fat @-@ deposits and is linked in some cases linked to fluid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ atology ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensi@@ tivity in patients who have pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ye or as a double combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ isation hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
following the introduction of the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , has been reported to report an occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma should be aware when patients report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of noti@@ fying events of adverse events , randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 years of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient is a pregnancy or a patient , the treatment is ab@@ using ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investig@@ ating the interaction have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics from dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with drugs which are posed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium can@@ v@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or are not expected .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on for 3 times .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is primarily attributable to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of breast canc@@ ers and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ red@@ dish growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data not estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and of the lens inde@@ xes , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T arri@@ vals occurred over three times the upper limit of the standard range far as often as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ye .
in an out@@ come study in patients with existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w was followed .
since the market launch , rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history .
a summary analysis of noti@@ fying events of adverse events , randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative groups .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , questionn@@ aires were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
at intake , the maximum dose of 120 mg / day took over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ation ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin sensi@@ tiveness of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral glucose in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic efficacy ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of patients treated ( versus 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficient , despite three @-@ month optimization , was randomly allocated to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c is reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients who continue to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group was observed .
in clinical trials over one year , there was a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ des compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , checked up to 18 weeks of study on type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as slightly , clin@@ ically significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , whereas under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one also reduced tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this is also improved on tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption as well as to the tri@@ glyc@@ eride absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ glyc@@ eride synthesis .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a cardiac activity study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were randomised , which received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , whereby the top concentrations of the un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one will usually reach 2 hours after use .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV represents the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in intervention studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not have relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics from dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases and reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
based on radioactive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the mar@@ ker was found mainly in the F@@ ä@@ s ( 55 % ) and found at a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination bracket for un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma @-@ cent@@ ration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are low in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearing of breast substance is similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , according to repeated pre @-@ volume plasma enlargement with hem@@ at@@ el@@ ution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e .
this is due to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast canc@@ eled and reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) the rat increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the ure@@ th@@ epi@@ theli@@ um epi@@ theli@@ um .
in a animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to an increased frequency of colon@@ iz@@ ers .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 years of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patients with women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the PRO@@ ACT@@ IVE study , a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events , questionn@@ aires were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patients ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study about two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in combination with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year , there was a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ des in comparison to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only increase the yield tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ ounces tri@@ glyc@@ eride level , this has a effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as to the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ ard synthesis .
although the study was missing on its primary end@@ point , a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cular ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , put results close to that with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular risk of cardiovascular risk .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot;
in a summary analysis of noti@@ fying events of adverse events , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 400 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and showed an increased incidence of bone brood in women .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was found in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ ph@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured the concentration of blood sugar level after 12 weeks .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human insulin .
acet@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied in patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove packages ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was eliminated in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Human@@ itarian S@@ elec@@ tor ( CH@@ MP ) will be evaluated in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug .
the medicine is an effective element in Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , insulin humane ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the process of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

acet@@ pi@@ d can not be used in patients who are potentially sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
furthermore , doses of ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d have to be adapted when it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect the blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S by approval for the acquisition of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin must be re@@ ared , then the amount of insulin will follow .
3 If the change to acet@@ pi@@ d in patients is required to allow a dose to dose , it may be necessary for the first dose or months after conversion .
before trips , which go over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his doctor since such trips can be applied , insulin and meals must be applied or taken in other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the appointment of gels - local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site during insulin therapy ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , sor@@ eness and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) occur .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape coins , cand@@ y , biscuits , or sugar fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness and sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) are treated by a proven aid kit or caused by glucose that is administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ glyc@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mol / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who have under@@ gone greater surgical intervention ( blood sugar 4,4 - 6.1 m@@ mol / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the actual maximum amount is reached within 1.5 @-@ 3.5 hours and the total active period is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and youth ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , consider that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in concentrations 0.05 g / ml - 1,0 % / ml ins@@ ane in the in@@ fusion fluids of 0.9 % sodium chloride , 5 % D glucose and 10 % D glucose with 40 m@@ mol / l cali@@ chloride can be used in polypropylene at room temperature for 24 hours .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already reported signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ances , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gre@@ ed no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; that means larger urine cryst@@ alli@@ zation , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ure@@ th@@ u@@ cle@@ ment will still be increased after two to four weeks , more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once daily .
during the first treatment of treatment still tox@@ ins occur , it is recommended that patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic more medicines for the prevention of toxic@@ ity .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had transplan@@ t transplan@@ t since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , participated in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( spotlight ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( a different medicines for treating hypertension ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose u@@ ure@@ tic acid level was under 6 mg / d@@ L during the last three measurements .
in the initial study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 million ) of the patients who once daily applied 120 mg in the final three measurements , in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ L .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients in placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart problems in history may also consist of increased risk of specific side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective at the lowering of the ure@@ tic acid in the blood more effective than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have increased risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hypertension in conditions which have already led to urine deposits ( including one out of the patient &apos;s history ) and / or a gre@@ ed arthritis ) .
if the serum concentration of 2 @-@ 4 weeks still remains at 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose of dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be considered .
in patients with severe kidney problems , efficacy and safety were not fully analyzed ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents because there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .

cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or un@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other resin acid drugs , it can occur during the treatment inci@@ dents during the treatment of an acute toxic@@ ation , because urine acid deposits initially can initially be mobil@@ ised in tissues .
B. for mal@@ icious diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increase that it comes to a di@@ stra@@ tification in the urine .
liver diseases During the phase 3 clinical trials were observed ( 3.5 % ) patients treated in the clinical studies of the liver disease ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform before the start of the Feb@@ os@@ o@@ stat@@ o and in further course depending on clinical findings and a liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ e were not performed in@@ effective studies in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition may lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line spi@@ ration ( an in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .

7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long@@ time renewal studies were 906 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years and 53 patients treated up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with a exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two Pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as below ) which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly specific serum levels of &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were in each trial .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ otonin value of study start at the beginning of &lt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / d@@ m3 .
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority among the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum levels at &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the medical visit in Week 2 and permanently retain the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney problems ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clinical significant differences concerning the percentage of recur@@ rence of the serum concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ L .
the phase 3 data collected in two years showed that the lasting decrease in the serum levels showed that less than 3 % of the patients were required in the months 16 to 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a gre@@ edy ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the no@@ d file size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the no@@ des until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma @-@ cent@@ ration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma @-@ level curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration is simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase is observed .
after taking a simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clinical significant change in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration was observed ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l to taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein integration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are primarily formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ os@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly developed by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ prominent Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine as un@@ changeable February ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose found in the chair as un@@ changeable Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabolism and their Kon@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or heavy kidney failure changed the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to normal kidney function .
the average total of AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 times by 7.5 m . h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) of liver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly reduced compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites according to taking multiple doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ ese , imp@@ air@@ ment of fermentation in male rats a statistically significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) were found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ dispens@@ er group , at approximately 11 times the exposure of the human exposure .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and Ur@@ in@@ fusion as a result of clinical use as not relevant .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are incub@@ ated ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk of low vitamin D mirrors is used .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or use of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium chloride and vitamin supplement ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie until after the first food intake of the day , which should not be placed at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used apart from other drugs which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than in those who were exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data to which the al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate dose contained in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is equal to the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones , or joints ) , and symptoms of digestive devices such as stomach pain , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhoea ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers , diar@@ rhoea ( ul@@ cer@@ ess ) , tri@@ mmed abdom@@ en ( blind@@ ed belly ) as well as su@@ ction locks .
in patients with chronic hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or any other constitu@@ ents , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be applied .
it must not be applied in cases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who cannot stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered in adult patients , a kidney or liver transplan@@ ts to prevent interference from transplan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft was already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft and data published in published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study enrolled in 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of ad@@ vag@@ inas was compared with progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients receiving transplan@@ t after a period of treatment ( by example , as often a renewed transplan@@ t or a re@@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were performed and investigated how Ad@@ vag@@ raf is recorded in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft from the body .

in patients with qu@@ en@@ si@@ tivity sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , mac@@ roph@@ y antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other parts may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with ad@@ vag@@ raf , since the adult dose or the dose of the drug may be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts , should arrange this medicine , or make changes in immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ful therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transplan@@ t @-@ effects or to an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immune supp@@ ression .
patients should always be retained the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; Modification of the formulation or of the regime should be made only under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
in a consequence of a transition to alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage for Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of rep@@ lication and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after changing the progra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ levels should be controlled prior to conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as an eye level , was comparable with both kidney and transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation below ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ life phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take a adjustment of the Ad@@ vag@@ inas @-@ Dos@@ is@@ Schem@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first postoperative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be used intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application for supp@@ ression of transplan@@ tation must be maintained ; therefore , the maximum duration of oral therapy may not be specified .
dose recommended for kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t @-@ transplan@@ tation The oral Ad@@ vaginal Therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
other dose adap@@ tations can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommended for liver transplan@@ t - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft fatigue therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dose recommended - conversion from progra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have a gra@@ ft receiver of twice daily dosage for a daily intake of ad@@ vag@@ inas , so this change@@ over is taken to a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the whole daily dose to take place .

other transplan@@ t , although no clinical experience with additives in lung cancer , pancre@@ as and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ t patients arrived in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patients group patients with reduced liver function to maintenance of blood c@@ tal@@ es in targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver function , a reduction of dose is required .
patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function has no effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
because of ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum concentration , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ lets and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the transition from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able to be careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the valley mirror in full blood . the dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of shock @-@ sho@@ cking and toler@@ ability in individual case using full blood pressure tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls on the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mud during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled by the Progra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or even when used substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Consum@@ ption ration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , custom@@ ization of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials make sure that successful treatment in most cases is possible , when the valley levels are not exceeded in the blood of 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood in the first time according to liver transplan@@ tations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with heart rate and heart@@ felt patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
blood concentrations in the range of 5 @-@ 15 ng / ml were generally used during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney , and transplan@@ t .
this led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ t @-@ sho@@ ots or other side effects , which can appear in succession of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always be retained the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; Modification of the formulation or of the regime should be made only under the eng@@ aging control of an experienced medical device ( see section 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , opposed to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ent formulation .
proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t transplan@@ tation with adult cor@@ transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents and transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents in childhood are still no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ent formulation .
because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a lowering of the tac@@ ro@@ climate levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the use of herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is included , or other plant breeding are avoided during treatment with ad@@ vag@@ inas ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients with diar@@ rho@@ e is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentration in the blood since the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , it was described as a Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy chamber or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e , which can therefore also occur among ad@@ vag@@ inas .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are a already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid load and o@@ dies .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be reduced due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for Pre@@ s such as headache , alter@@ ations of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res , and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . )
since Ad@@ vaginal Hard@@ capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lact@@ ose , is particular advis@@ able in patients with rare her@@ edit@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency , or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous application of herbal medicines or herbal medicinal products , known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Blood levels in the same @-@ term gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining even more relevant concentrations ( see section 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal verification , resulting .
highly dosed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute demo@@ lition reaction , can increase the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; hence the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that can be metabolic by CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
because Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may come down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive and thus increase the hormone ex@@ position , decisions are particularly cau@@ tious in decisions concerning recep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a minor number of examinations on transplan@@ tation system provide no indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants , increased risk of undes@@ i@@ rable events in relation to the course and the result of pregnancy .
in u@@ ter@@ o exposure there is a monitoring of the new@@ born new@@ bor@@ ns on the harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding his effect on the kidneys ) .

chronic transplan@@ tation of chronic transplan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis obl@@ iter@@ ative syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after the transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .

the number of cases where there was no acute transplan@@ tation , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the l@@ ung@@ ing patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .

factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ul@@ um and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for transplan@@ tation of the higher Clear@@ ance rates .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metabolic because the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly attributable to bile .
in stable patients conducted by Progra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose was the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Ad@@ vaginal &apos;s close to 10 % lower than in programming .

advances will be used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood pressure disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of application will be addressed , whether Adv@@ ate is applied to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human line factor VIII .
advances is similar to another in the European Union of approved drug named re@@ bin@@ ate , but is similar , however , that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ates in preventing bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ iso@@ des with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; rated .
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advances must not be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against human brain factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the remaining components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG to offer an approval for the adv@@ ent of Adv@@ ates in the European Union .
dosage : dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution of the factor VIII @-@ Man@@ gel , after the place and the extent of blood and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the appropriate plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours of patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
during the treatment , the dose of anti @-@ inflammatory dose and the frequency of injection is appropriate to determine the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ m@@ astic .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis For long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A are to be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kil@@ ogram of body weight in 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII is not achieved , or if the bleeding is not gover@@ ned with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be er@@ adic@@ ated .
the dos@@ ing rate should be addressed after the patient , where a maximum injection @-@ rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the projected activity of factor VIII , ignor@@ ant , which was quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay .
developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position stage is on the biggest and of genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 extern@@ alities and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ isation , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ Product to another , re@@ appear of ( humili@@ ating ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding have no experiences yet .
the A@@ DR@@ s were included in the greatest number of patients receiving inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had an increased risk of inhibit@@ ors of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) calculated using the sum of the blood cl@@ an factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els ( 10 - 14 . postoperative day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was maintained during the whole period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only a patient after 26 evaluation cases with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
furthermore , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) were diagnosed with a factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients with an inhibit@@ ors of factor VIII .
the response of patients on the traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibodies against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms indicate allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients showed up over the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ l gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product positions as part of the study .
7 . as with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported via hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VIII works as a c@@ of@@ ac@@ tor for the activated factor IX , and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VIII @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were obtained from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in the table below 3 .

based on the initial approval of available data , the CH@@ MP has evaluated the benefit risk pro@@ vision@@ ing as a positive value , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP is required on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE security profile that requires a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the marketing owner should apply another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval for the adv@@ ent of Adv@@ ance of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissues , connects other structures in the body , surrounded and based ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ovirus , &quot; which is so changed that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infection can trigger in humans .
advances in tum@@ ours could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow cancer cells to restore normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defect in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can &apos;t be restored .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells could continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of sub @-@ construction , in bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers from the company on which questions had checked , were still some questions un@@ explained .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP on Day 120 creates a list of questions which will be sent to the company .
after the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors bring benefits to patients .
the committee had further concerns on the processing of the medicine in the body , type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in general contact with the patient .
the company does not bet the CH@@ MP in knowledge if the withdrawal for patients who currently work on clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective ingredients are immediately released and the other will be released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergy rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tival s@@ mu@@ c@@ skin ( c@@ logged nose ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and end once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug may be ref@@ illed to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the most effective measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ crit@@ eri@@ ous symptoms , which were reported from patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in view of all the loc@@ ust symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients receiving aer@@ in@@ aze , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a were considered , the patients below aer@@ in@@ aze showed a alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7,4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common adverse events of Aer@@ ob@@ aze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( cor@@ nea ) , sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nia ( insom@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( insom@@ nia ) , insom@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge molecular entities or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different medicines for the treatment of allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze must not be used in patients who suffer from a bott@@ len@@ tic@@ ular glaucoma ( increased blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ blood pressure caused stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe , approval for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ aze within the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is not to swal@@ low on the whole ( i.e. without them to break or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ ob@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to mis@@ use and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after deduc@@ ting the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as for a long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can be removed .
after the drop in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be continued as mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ et@@ etic activity of combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ glomer@@ ate such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ ide , cab@@ erg@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective , and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations to the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment at the occurr@@ ence of hypertension or a speed@@ ometer , or any other neurological symptoms , nausea , or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or an ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
the treatment of the following patient groups is advised to be careful : • Pati@@ ents under digital disease • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the history of diabetes , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder so@@ b@@ aric or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in history .
Aer@@ in@@ aze must imp@@ ose at least 48 hours before carrying out the mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can prevent positive reactions to indicators for inter@@ actions and reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test , there were no significant differences in the patients treated with lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with placebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not identified yet so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ im@@ pe@@ des in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 un@@ inhi@@ bit and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate , nor one inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ conc@@ ub@@ ility of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , yet with a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and should not be used in the cause of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ous properties of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy .
the patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , heart @-@ circulation coll@@ ision ) and a CN@@ S ab@@ norm@@ ality ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ als .
headache , anxiety , frigh@@ tening microphone , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spi@@ ration , nausea , vomiting , preventive pain , dizziness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , tend@@ ons , and hyp@@ oten@@ sion .
a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as At@@ roph@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( oral mixture , pup@@ il rigid and di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human base cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ sion@@ ate P @-@ S@@ ine of endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fication , sub@@ jective impact or tasks that are associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed compared to placebo .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 248 patients with seasonal rhin@@ itis took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine @-@ agon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined based on the total score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ g@@ inal sw@@ ell@@ ation ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets in regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tival s@@ mu@@ te , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
according to the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equivalent of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ isation study , which was carried out with the formulation of a tablet in healthy adult subjects , was found that four volunteers des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was badly damaged .
a component inter@@ act study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in after the sole gift of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated treatment , for ac@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproductive con@@ vol@@ atility , clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ mits have no special dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed in general related to the compound P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in reproductive @-@ production studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was the combination of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the author@@ isation for author@@ isation of the pharmaceutical system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the symptoms of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance and its effect can un@@ fold .
Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms that appear in connection with seasonal rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose and t@@ ang@@ ing eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you can be sensitive to the mu@@ c@@ ous medicines of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , which is contained in this medicine .

tell your doctor if using Aer@@ in@@ aze following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed : • hypertension • cardiac ch@@ ase , pal@@ pit@@ ations • cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , headache , or ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches .
when you use Aer@@ in@@ aze with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you are taking other medicines or have taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
traffic jams and the use of machines for use in the recommended dosage is not to calculate that Aer@@ in@@ aze leads to drow@@ sin@@ ess or reli@@ es attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you should have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze than you should .
if you have forgotten the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible , and apply the next dose for the planned time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists when one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may observe side effects that are not listed in this manual information .
cor@@ ch@@ ase , Rast@@ el@@ essness with increased physical activity , mouth drying , dizziness , sore pains , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar , thirst , headache , headache , insom@@ nia , nerv@@ ousness and drow@@ sin@@ ess .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions ( respiratory , pf@@ ei@@ gh breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash was reported .
over cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , cor@@ ch@@ ase , stomach pains , nausea , vomiting , stomach pains , diarrhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zu@@ res , distur@@ ban@@ ces with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of ob@@ tru@@ sive liver values were also very rare reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( solv@@ able tablet ) , 2,5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged between one and five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which contains 2.5 ml of syrup .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml syrup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the p@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and efficiency on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
there were further studies to prove that the body utili@@ zes the syrup , solution for inser@@ ting and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application for children un@@ think@@ able .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us became an average decrease of the symp@@ tom ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symp@@ tom after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ re@@ adin or one of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe &apos;s approval for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , at alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out in accordance with the previous disease and can be resum@@ ed after the end of the symptoms and resum@@ ed in their recovery .
the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended during the po@@ uring of a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not established in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , treatment of alco@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not intensi@@ fied by taking alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the patients should not be clari@@ fied , however , that it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines .
clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo .
the most frequently visited side effects , which was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adolescents from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect of headache , which were treated in 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with placebo in 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose study , which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given no clinical relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human base cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adh@@ es@@ sion@@ ate P @-@ S@@ ine of endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical trial with multiple doses ranging from up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical trials ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interv@@ alls .
at a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables , including ampli@@ fication , sub@@ jective impact or tasks that are associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ b@@ ble , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , irrit@@ ation and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence of the duration of symptoms may also be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks .
perme@@ ating allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as is shown by the total score of the quality of life on the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the severe allergic rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal @-@ allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investig@@ ating further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the under@@ lying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to eth@@ ti@@ ology in different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recruited .
since the hist@@ amine is an elementary factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is expected , except with the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quotes at the end of the first dose interv@@ alls .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and growth significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patients &quot; bi@@ ographies were comparable to the general sa@@ ison@@ ous rhin@@ itis @-@ population comparable , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no evidence points for a clinical @-@ relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not identified yet so that inter@@ actions with other drugs are not entirely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ im@@ pe@@ des in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate , nor one inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not look to the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical trials demonstrated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ adin , in a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the toxic@@ ity of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity , repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reproductive mac@@ ulation , clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ mits have no particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of meals , including symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below 4.4 ) and that there is no data available that support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with a@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , there should be a role in diagnosis , physical tests and corresponding laboratory and skin tests .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic would be reduced and experienced a higher resolution load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are restricted to metabolic , is identical to children who do normally metabolic .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edit@@ ary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ less absorption , or a su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency does not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not established in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study NSC 631570 was not increasingly increased by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
overall incidence of adverse events with children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group , as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were given no clinical relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who came to an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment in question was a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ indo@@ sis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis , chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults of children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical trials ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness is detected in comparison to placebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no imp@@ air@@ ment of the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies an adult , it was neither with the simultaneous dose of alcohol neither a ampli@@ fication of the alcohol @-@ induced power consumption , nor to increasing the drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as ni@@ b@@ ble , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , irrit@@ ation and redness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as seen by the total score of the quality of life on the quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effectively produced by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quotes at the end of the first dose interv@@ alls .
this reduced metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger at Black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ c@@ asian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the syrup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are restricted to metabolic , observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4@@ times higher with one terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no evidence points for a clinical @-@ relevant active ingredient Cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max value of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with the recommended doses of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible body was not identified yet so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is available in type III bra@@ ung@@ laser with child@@ proof polypropylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ ysty@@ rene measuring sco@@ op , cali@@ br@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml , or with an application injection for preparations for inser@@ tion of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) .
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at once daily put in the mouth for reducing the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
immediately before the application , the Bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophil@@ es must be taken from , without damage them .

Novartis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. were officially distributed to the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) in June 2008 that the company opens its application for approval by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect influenza , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza virus .
this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a stem of the influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus has emerged , which can be easily spread from man , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the immune system in the vaccine as &quot; body foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus .
the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on membran@@ es surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) is separated , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study had not been carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
by this , the extent of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA region &apos;s guidelines in prevent@@ ative vaccines .
should you participate in clinical examination and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you want further information regarding the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are caused by the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules can be used as a solution to inhal@@ e , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not examined .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be prescribed only if the doctor has examined , which has taken an anti@@ viral medication of the patient previously , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood is that the virus will appeal to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together twice daily with 100 mg of rite avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ generated is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medication , the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level .
AIDS does not heal , however , the damage to the immune system can , and thus , to do the development of AIDS , infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medication , but without chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , investig@@ ating two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with protagon@@ ists .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased with low dose of drug A@@ gener@@ ase , with 206 adults , who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or , compared with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who had previously had taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or had had a viral load among 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics were very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ sures , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who had their previous prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ e ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , skin rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ generators too may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines , which are just as A@@ gener@@ ase and are taken to high concentrations in the blood of health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , an o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immune system syn@@ dro@@ id ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee on Human@@ itarian S@@ elec@@ tor ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication used in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medication treated with HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amp@@ lif@@ iers , but the committee noted that the benefit from A@@ generic ase in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken protein inhibit@@ or .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; only limited information at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited gave the approval to the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited , approval for the placing of A@@ generators in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication used to treat HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ generators should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic p@@ adding of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be achieved using the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inhal@@ ation is 14 % lower than one capsule , therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules is 600 mg / b@@ lown twice daily along with 100 mg of rite cavi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are used without the enh@@ ancing addition of rite cavi@@ r ( p@@ adding ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ generated ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ tig@@ ase in combination with low doses of rite or other protagon@@ ists were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to failure of data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily with moderate liver function for 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver problems , 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be applied in patients with mild or moderate liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generators cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also pose a sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations , the St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma levels and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r during intake of am@@ on@@ cavi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should not be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy did not lead to a healing of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transfer@@ ring HIV towards others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generators should be used together with low doses of rite @-@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy treatment , have increased risk of severe liver intervention with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an equivalent anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this product .
patients with existing liver function , including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ tic@@ ason or other glu@@ co@@ oc@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , which are mod@@ ulated via CY@@ P3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic @-@ smoking o@@ i@@ der effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supple@@ ression of the ad@@ oci@@ dal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because the material inter@@ change@@ over of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin strongly recommended by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of ast@@ ag@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including ra@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ality ) , are methods to determine the concentration of active concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective for reduced plasma levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r less ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic inter@@ actions with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ dic@@ ation , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ on@@ at@@ ori@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ y@@ symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rite cavi@@ ties .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity , due to the high pro@@ gen@@ esis of the A@@ generated solution , this formulation is contrac@@ ted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed for duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ e@@ as@@ yn@@ mer , has been reported using the occurr@@ ence of type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , or an ec@@ ot@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , to whose therapy drugs were needed , which are associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with metabolic disorders .
ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants , reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ ats .
in the time of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ otherapy , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infection that leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ t@@ orial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , were reported cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width , should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also pose a sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with pharmac@@ euticals , their active ingredients are predominantly associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the lowest plasma levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rite avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already entering St John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ b@@ av@@ ir@@ onic mirror and if possible , to check the vir@@ us@@ load and add the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with amp@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ gu@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
for C@@ max , 508 % increases , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg / b@@ b@@ av@@ r were used twice daily and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and in@@ conc@@ ub@@ ility of this treatment scheme .
in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ ar avi@@ r + 100 mg of rite @-@ cavi@@ r daily ) was given .
the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved in combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ ar avi@@ r + 100 mg of cavi@@ ar ( 600 mg twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg of rite cavi@@ r daily is administered twice daily .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for eng@@ aging monitoring because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ ese in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ azi@@ de component of di@@ dan@@ ese , there are at least one hour apart due to the ant@@ azi@@ de component ( see Ant@@ acids below ) .
for this reason , in combination with E@@ chel@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) and rite cavi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose to dose is required .
treatment with E@@ lo@@ ad@@ ence in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protagon@@ ists would be inhibit@@ or .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ yn@@ mer and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r .
if this medication should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ dine could be less effective because of the dimin@@ ished or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these medicines are used together , caution is necessary ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring will be performed as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ nights on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous development of Am@@ b@@ abo@@ o and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in Plas@@ ma@@ ab@@ u@@ tin ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is required together with a@@ or@@ ase , to reduce the dose of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with inter@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both medications could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole twice daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 % ) compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ra@@ b@@ az@@ ol .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can be applied in common with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ mer , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it may occur to res@@ or@@ atory disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ va , known as an enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plasma bar of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , ni@@ di@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , N@@ is@@ pin , can increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug .
simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase the plasma @-@ cent@@ ric concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ oten@@ sion , tend@@ ons , and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the rite level 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g fluor@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) were significantly reduced by approximately 86 % , while endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ( 90 % distribution interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these glu@@ co@@ oc@@ or@@ rho@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic @-@ smoking o@@ i@@ der effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose pollution is strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , are significant increases of plasma levels in simultaneous administration of a@@ or@@ ase .
because plas@@ tic@@ ular increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , including a rh@@ ubar@@ b oly@@ sis , is not recommended to use the combined use of this medicine with am@@ on@@ cavi@@ r .
it is recommended to be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zation of mirrors because the plasma @-@ cent@@ ration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the same gift of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r . ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while in the current application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advis@@ able .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with am@@ id@@ av@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium acid symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rite cavi@@ ties .
because of the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is no recommendation to adapt , such as the am@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose , when Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
at the same time of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ eman@@ cip@@ es , together with A@@ gener@@ a , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ dic@@ ation is not predic@@ table , as an alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful inten@@ tions for the mother compared to the potential risks of the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lact@@ ating rats , Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is survi@@ ving in human breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by in@@ solven@@ cy in the u@@ terus until the end of the stagn@@ ation period Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase of 12 body weight during the stagn@@ ation period .
the further development of earnings , including fertili@@ zation , and reproductive ability , was not affected by the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the mother@@ tier .
the in@@ conc@@ ei@@ ability of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
most of the treatment @-@ related side @-@ related side effects were slightly up to moderate , rose early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied , whether they are related to HIV treatment or any other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the neutral disease .
most of the ab@@ ov@@ emen@@ tioned effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , which did not pre @-@ treated patients 1,200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were weigh@@ ted from the verification than in connection with the study medication , were listed in more than 1 % of the patients ( grade 3 to 4 ) .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and toxic fatty tissues , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e of the breasts and dor@@ as cereb@@ ral fat accumulation ( sti@@ cking ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ ad@@ av@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a mean duration of 36 weeks was only one case ( sti@@ cking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - were treated with 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is above a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .

cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis mainly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the time of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ o@@ deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an anti @-@ inflammatory reaction on asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opport@@ un@@ istic infection ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI treated patients who received 600 mg of acid twice daily with a low dose of rite ( 100 mg twice daily ) , were kind and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dose of rite , very often .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is based on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures .

the 50 % natural concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of ammon@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells , and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ on@@ b@@ av@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in man is still not defined .
for the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ra@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - such as with other rite @-@ oo@@ ar treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , the 700@@ mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r was obtained twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred until week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic could be examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a four @-@ rolog@@ ical failure included in the 59 , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg / 100 mg ) with prot@@ e@@ as@@ tic@@ us treated patients with vi@@ rology failure above 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations appeared :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resist@@ or @-@ based analyses , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ nights or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rite cavi@@ ar in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is defined as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M as well as a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations , changes are subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyse resistance tests .
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ical resist@@ or @-@ based analyses , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data on the estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rite cavi@@ ar in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
companies to drive diagnostic resistance tests have clin@@ ically developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to evaluate the results of a resistance testing .
each four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ associated genetic pattern produces a certain cross@@ resistance against rite avi@@ r , which remains sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other protagon@@ ists for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r Resist@@ ers , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , in which a Fos@@ av@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ ad@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ qu@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice @-@ versa , Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits imposed on the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the effectiveness of A@@ generic ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ sid@@ an@@ alog@@ a ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , predominantly with a humili@@ ated rite level .
one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the study study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ routine wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of untreated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in studies , A@@ generic solution was used daily for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
it was given no low dose of ay@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study included plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml of a median increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered to be expected to be considered by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; innocent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of ammon@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 up to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for C@@ max , by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of ammon@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous dietary intake influenced the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and is mounted on a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ bass@@ ist from the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ at@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ used am@@ on@@ cavi@@ ties remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady State in the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drug may induc@@ ing or reduce the CY@@ P3@@ A4 or specify a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 with caution when they are given at the same time with a@@ att@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ us@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is made of a solution of 14 % less bi@@ d@@ mt as from the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar .
also the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a kidney function should be low on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ nights .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma , comparable to those who are b@@ lown up to healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg / b@@ b@@ av@@ r daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ on@@ at@@ ula in mice and rats joined male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in doses of mice ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - triple ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice a day of 1200 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 under@@ lying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of this observ@@ ational effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present examination data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro diagnostics tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core test to rats and chromosome aber@@ ration to human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
these liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical use of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment .
studies for toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which were treated from a age of 4 days , showed both in the control and with the Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r animals treated with high mortality .
in a systematic Plas@@ ma@@ ex@@ position , significantly higher ( rabbits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses of humans were observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and less@@ er skel@@ etal changes were observed on a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sules are used without the enh@@ ancing addition of rite cavi@@ r ( p@@ adding ) , higher doses have to be applied to A@@ generated ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be applied in patients with weak or lighter liver problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse events , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ality ) , are methods to determine the concentration of active concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , associated with metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
for C@@ max , 508 % increases , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .

a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ b@@ av@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended for eng@@ aging monitoring because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ lo@@ ad@@ ence in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protagon@@ ists would be inhibit@@ or .
if these medicines are used together , caution is necessary ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring will be performed as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ nights on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is required together with a@@ or@@ ase , to reduce the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available .

the 50 % natural concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of ammon@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice @-@ versa , Am@@ é@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tics @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , treatment optim@@ isation should be considered with PI treated with PI for the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ successful &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ successful am@@ on@@ at@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active changes during the dos@@ ing intervals in the Ste@@ ady State in the area of C@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss ..

&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solution was not necessary either with PI treated patients or PI treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inhal@@ ation is 14 % lower than one capsule , therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable for one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be able once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2800 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no dose recommended for the simultaneous application of as@@ er@@ ase solution to intake and low dose of cavi@@ ar , this combination may be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose of dose is not necessary for am@@ on@@ cavi@@ ties , an application of A@@ generic solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ y@@ col@@ l content , A@@ generic solution is to take with children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may result in a com@@ peti@@ tive in@@ hibition of the drug of the drug , and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening adverse events such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as disorders ( z .
patients should not be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy did not lead to a healing of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opport@@ un@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .

the applic@@ ability and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of Al@@ dar@@ a for up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , it is five weeks twice a week . • In case of acute ker@@ at@@ ry , it is available for six weeks during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is th@@ inn@@ ed in front of the sleeping spot on the affected areas of skin , so that it remains enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed away .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies in 9@@ 23 patients with War@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete de@@ allocation of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • For treatment in all four major studies , 15 % to 52 % were treated with placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma showed a complete inflation rate of 66 % to 80 % when compared with Al@@ dar@@ a treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible clim@@ bs are disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the above described treatment should be met if intense local inflammation occurs ( see Section 4.4 ) , or if there is infection in the treatment area .
if a follow @-@ up examination includes 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , les@@ ions would only be completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream , once he / she not@@ ices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is available in a thin layer and st@@ oned in the st@@ oned , with gra@@ dients of infected skin cells until the cream is completely covered .
it should be used in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and associated with a possible deteri@@ oration of its auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a decrease in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and with a possible organ sho@@ ot@@ ation or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ - response related risk .
in other studies , in which no daily proposal was carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with one of the circumcision &apos;s leading Stri@@ c@@ ture were observed .
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions came up at the output of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing the water which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly connected to a treatment with other cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of external threads in the Gen@@ ital@@ - and Peri@@ an@@ al@@ area , there are no clinical experiences yet .
limited data indicate an increased rate of F@@ eig@@ ne@@ zen@@ reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the removal of the clim@@ bers , however , indicated a less@@ er effectiveness .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with sci@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ y fish was not examined .
local hood actions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take away in general during therapy or reactions , after finishing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reaction , a treatment may be taken out of several days .
the clinical results of therapy can be judged after the recovery of the treated skin for 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
there are currently no data on long @-@ term cur@@ ing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma should be applied to other suitable treatment forms .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experience , so the use of untreated melan@@ omas is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that at large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) , a less@@ er probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip@@ tic area inside the lip@@ r@@ ots .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ eries in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ pants on low @-@ arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application @-@ purpose , so a such application is not recommended .
local hood actions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take over the therapy to intensity , or go back after using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
if local skin reactions cause big dis@@ comfort , or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for several days .
the data of an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions have lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied to care in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ant treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ red@@ ale development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .

in clinical trials for investig@@ ating I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
the average unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which equ@@ ates to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systematic concentrations of the Alp@@ ha@@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 application @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete allocation of the clim@@ bs at a I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is significantly superior to 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in total , 119 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients were fully treated ; this was in 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) .
a full healing of 23 % of 157 treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , versus 5 % of 161 treated with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) of all patients treated clin@@ ically , and this also remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of a week in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week @-@ time period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ ics , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic nu@@ - les@@ ions within a connected 25 c@@ m2 of large treatment areas as on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
results from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical ex@@ h@@ ings after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external threads , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma are usually not based on pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream has been studied in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies where dos@@ ages were not shown ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks .
a minimum systemic intake of 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during three times weekly use during 16 weeks .
the highest medicine concentrations observed in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ alled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bag ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bag ) .
the estimated half @-@ time period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ year period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study , which indicates an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study for painting toxic@@ ity , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body@@ weight and increased Mil@@ z weight . another study carried out by using a similar effects as well as four months .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ icity of mice near the oral administration was induced in three days per week .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ agen@@ das , is a risk for humans based on systemic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors were treated in mice that was treated with the effective open cream , used earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other human beings , even if these were the same symptoms as you . − If any of the side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice any side effects that are not listed in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
● blo@@ oms ( Cond@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , which formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( genital organs ) and An@@ us ( after ) formed a common , slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread on other parts of the body .
if it remains un@@ treated , it can lead to un@@ positions , in particular in the face - hence an early detection and - treatment important .
Ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ opo@@ lies are rough areas of the skin , which occur in humans , which were exposed to a lot of sunlight during their previous life .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with sigh@@ ted diagnosis of a mu@@ d@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ tin I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurological symptoms of the disease ( symptoms that are not related with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( Gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ ph@@ kan@@ e , g@@ ags ) will not be disman@@ tled , thus in most organs in the body , and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements make difficult , reduces lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a physician , who possesses experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ ation equipment , and patients need to prevent the appropriate medicines in order to prevent allergic reaction .

in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured in response to reducing the concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated at the end of the study a normal big liver .
the most common adverse events of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia , pain in lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions .
frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ die ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react in patients who are potentially over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will update all new information that may be known , check and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is receiving patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to bring an approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative for the long @-@ term En@@ cy@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ fication I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurological symptoms of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edit@@ ary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , all 15 minutes in single steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not identified , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion reactions that are defined as each related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should also continue to monitor eng@@ m@@ esh@@ y , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be available only in a reasonable clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase are expected , usually within 3 months of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience concerning the recovery of treatment after a longer break , it must be cau@@ tious because of the theore@@ tically increased risk pro@@ vision@@ ing after a dis@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ra@@ ka ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be carried out and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be hal@@ ted until the symptoms are used to decline with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with an in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 are used ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cell intake of lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase exists .
animal experiments do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase over breast milk , is advised to un@@ load during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were given mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
un@@ wanted drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during Phase 3 study and an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older are listed in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the history there were severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory shut@@ down and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children un@@ wanted drug effects in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who have been reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe floo@@ ding and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once per week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby it occurred in the patients under the age of 5 , mostly within a month period ( on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( respectively until a premature drop@@ out of the study ) were not reported by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ last@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay &apos;s proven antibody , among them 3 patients , with whom it had never been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low anti @-@ antibody mirror showed a robust reduction in the sp@@ ag @-@ mirror in the har@@ n while patients with high antibodies were found a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal until low @-@ neutr@@ alizing correc@@ tive effect on the enzy@@ matic brain activity in vitro which seemed to significantly affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse medicines , even if the occurr@@ ence of adverse medicines typically occurred along with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enzyme @-@ replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats , and preventing a further accumulation of enzyme .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells in lymp@@ ho@@ os@@ omes , the most likely about Mann@@ i @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ized in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recruited to study the whole disease spectrum , the majority of patients with the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient demonstrated the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recruited if they had accelerated exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected values , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received more 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me compared to the placebo group to improve lung function and the capacity that is shown in the following table .
in the open renewal study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the projected pro @-@ cent@@ ric FE@@ V is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with one h@@ ep@@ atomic atomic therapy reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inine ) has remained constant .
in terms of het@@ ero@@ gene@@ ous disease values between the patients receiving a combined final frequency ( at the anticipated level of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted an open Phase 2 study , mainly investig@@ ating the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study at 5 years old ( 16 patients with heavy displacement form and 4 with the middle course form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 e / kg due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was found according to the Z score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium stroke rate indicate a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe wiring form only limited or even no progress in cog@@ nitive development .
in a phase 4 study investigations were performed to pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ dos@@ ing scheme on the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once per week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the Do@@ si@@ fication scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a justi@@ fiable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing scheme is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will specify any new information that will be available , annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeat@@ ability and reproductive mac@@ ulation , the pre @-@ clinical data cannot realize special dangers for humans .
since there were no toler@@ ability studies , this drug may not be mixed with other drugs , except those listed under 6.@@ 6 .

this register will become longer @-@ term security and efficacy information related to patients who have been treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural Pro@@ gre@@ di@@ ence of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients who suffer from M@@ PS I is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ oni@@ d@@ ase , which divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( Gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ kan@@ e ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( excessive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ oni@@ d@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion reaction is any side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other drugs , please inform your doctor if you take pharmac@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you are taking other medicines or have taken recently , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
hin@@ ts for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before use and is intended for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it , all 15 minutes more gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in history , however , severe reactions came up , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory shut@@ down and facial oils .

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • J@@ e after body weight of the individual patients initially determine the number of in@@ dil@@ uted bottles .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different medicines for cancer ) in patients who have not spread any chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) or &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic , non @-@ cell lung cancer that can &apos;t attack the epi@@ theli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have previously not been treated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and patients who had previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies before , as all@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to some therapy .
to decrease side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid man@@ ure ) .
in patients whose blood is changed , or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be lowered , reduced or reduced dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
converting P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations in the active form of medication and longer mode of cancer cells .
the treatment of the Mali@@ an Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was investig@@ ating A@@ lim@@ ta in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta resulted in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients with which cancer did not attack the epi@@ theli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission announced that Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. made an approval for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each side @-@ in bottle has to be filled with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which makes a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ sh@@ sis of the necessary do@@ x is extracted and dil@@ uted with a 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is used in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic colo@@ rec@@ tal cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .

the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
as a result of the incidence and sever@@ ity of skin reaction must be given a day before and on the day of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ gifts and on the day after the treatment of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid must be taken , and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients must also receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third event cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , should be created a complete blood picture before each gift , including a differentiation of the leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te census .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ times of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose check must take place under the effects of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated accordingly to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used to apply for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 bleeding .
if patients should develop non @-@ hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , treatment must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must act before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be ab@@ orted if patients with 2 dose products or non @-@ hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ atology toxic@@ ity in Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that patients in the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients aged 65 years is an increased by @-@ effective risk management .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data for un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose @-@ adap@@ tations were necessary to carry out the recommended dose adjustment for all patients recommended dose .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with metast@@ asis of liver metast@@ asis ) were not examined especially in studies .
patients must be monitored in regard to the bone @-@ market supp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutral number is again att@@ ained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - Cy@@ pri@@ ot has achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neutral number , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as they were observed in previous treatment cycles . ( see section 4.2 ) .
a less toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ malign@@ ity toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutr@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was regarded when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients have to be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ yl@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce un@@ balanced toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ oid Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ ka ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ less than 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for treatment with pel@@ le@@ re@@ mixed , must be avoided by N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients when these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ d@@ ration , pre@@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection in trans@@ cellular space must be er@@ adic@@ ated in the trans@@ cellular space in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ astic events have been reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this ingredient was administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed live vaccine ( except yellow fever , these vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of a ir@@ reversible cor@@ di@@ ation of reproductive ability due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the patient ref@@ using to obtain advice on the sper@@ mat@@ ology .
patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can lead high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid Anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g. daily ) to a reduced breakdown of adverse effects .
therefore , be careful when in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ inine @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on day of therapy and mind@@ ing , 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the inter@@ actions with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed to be avoided .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the brain status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ eman@@ cip@@ es and ant@@ ine@@ op@@ l@@ astic chemotherapy require increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ eman@@ cip@@ ation .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed at pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites are expected during a application in pregnancy severe birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed can not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful feeding of the user for the mother and risk for the F@@ öt@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive ability due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice on the blocking strategy .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received medical examination ( randomised and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement in the clinical relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the Mali@@ an Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ oma was shown in the use of the lun@@ ar @-@ carcin@@ oma in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are caused by improving the lung functioning parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function within the time of the control .
a multic@@ enter , random@@ ized , open Phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy reported a median survival of 8.3 months with AL@@ IM@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and from 7,9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology to the treatment effect fell to the overall survival rate of AL@@ IM@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC , with NSC@@ LC , with NSC@@ LC ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate randomised , controlled phase 3 study shows that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of IT@@ T population and support non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of the AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite the gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination of AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.9 ) for the combination AL@@ IM@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 2@@ 8.2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine Cis@@ pl@@ atin .

it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in connection with a low @-@ cal@@ orie di@@ cal@@ med diet .
patients who take all@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ists .
these enzymes are inhi@@ bited them , they may not remove some fats in the food , thereby resulting in about a quarter of fats due to the diet .
in a third study all@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who were all@@ i 60 mg , compared to an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no longer could be observed for the patient of relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily st@@ ains at after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with chair , chair , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , ling@@ ering secondary secre@@ tion ( F@@ ä@@ s ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) , and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ transplan@@ tation in transplan@@ t patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it cannot be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which do not have enough nutrients from digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or lact@@ ating mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited , approval for the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction by adults with overweight ( body mass index BMI of 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in connection with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fet@@ tre@@ ated diet .
all@@ i must not be applied by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data for efficacy and safety .
as or@@ list@@ at , however , only minim@@ ally absor@@ bs , is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .

the lik@@ el@@ ihood of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase when all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be included with improved metabolic control , patients who consult a drug against diabetes prior to start of a therapy with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ists , because the dose of anti @-@ diabe@@ tic may be adapted .
patients receiving all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dose of this drug needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent damage in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ e possible failure of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study at inter@@ actions of pharmac@@ euticals as well as in several cases with the current application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a decrease of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma processor .
in combination with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators in combination with or@@ list@@ at could affect the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alization , IN@@ R ) ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins remained in the standard range .
however , the patients should be recommended before bed@@ time , an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitality ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at simultaneously , observed a minor decline of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of recorded fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg above a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the frequently occurring are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .
the frequency of the relevant side effects found after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ defined size .
+ It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ ying on possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the release reported cases of or@@ list@@ at su@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals can be assumed by a rapid recovery of a systemic effects that are attributed to the li@@ mp@@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effects in the lum@@ ens of stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine caused by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ t@@ orial Li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical studies were derived from clinical studies that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , which blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ch .
two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI of 28 kg / m2 serves the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fet@@ tre@@ ated diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ani@@ zation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) , and as a percentage of people who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mol / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mol / l ) .

plasma parts of non @-@ metabolic or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , for therapeutic doses of plasma , or@@ list@@ at could not only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml , or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mol ) and without any indication of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients who were minim@@ ally administered system@@ ically stressed dose , two major metabolic diseases , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after completion of the N @-@ forming leu@@ cine group ) , could be identified to close to 42 % of the total plas@@ tic@@ ular concentration .

alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are ( like Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi can be increased by the extra gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information .
this means that the substance that prevents the substance of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies of 1 8@@ 42 adult investig@@ ating chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of the patients who were treated with alo@@ xi were not vomiting ( 132 by 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting proved , 81 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi were not vomiting ( 153 of 189 ) , 69 % of those treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted a approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on display , patients with am@@ nesty law or signs of an acute i@@ le@@ us should be monitored after injection .
however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is advis@@ able in the current gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with drugs that extend the Q@@ T interval or patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval leng@@ th@@ ens or tend to be an extension .
except in connection with a further chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics gift , alo@@ xi should not be used in the days after chemotherapy not to prevent nausea and vomiting .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron un@@ inhi@@ bited the activity of five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis revealed that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , chlor@@ of@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , Par@@ an@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences about the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ures are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is considered to be treated by a treat doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common subjects were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which , at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity and reactions at the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ sales reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar symptoms of adverse events demonstrated as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out because of the major distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have an effective therapy at a Alo@@ ha over@@ do@@ zation .
in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ os@@ cel@@ ron ( half @-@ value 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( semi @-@ value 7.3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously on day 1 without the exam@@ eth@@ as@@ ason intraven@@ ously .
in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderately em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) chemotherapy was the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron owns the ability to block the I@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the ion channels and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of I.@@ V. ab@@ orted pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses ranging from 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in the Plas@@ ma@@ on@@ zent@@ aci@@ an initial reduction in the body with an average maturity of half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally distributed in the total dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg with dogs and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , 5 measured average ( ± SD ) was measured from the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 42 ± 34 % .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations come out that at once daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached in 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with which after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration reached 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the input of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies of metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in a less@@ er extent that are involved with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ ject , the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver function have increased the termin@@ ale elimination @-@ value and the average System@@ ic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered to be adequ@@ ately viewed over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to clinical use .
10 out of pre @-@ clinical trials , indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels which can be involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action duration .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was given to about 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure when people ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumor , endo@@ cr@@ o , pancre@@ as , ad@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the under@@ lying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high dos@@ ages and as Alo@@ xi when people use a unique application , relevance of these results is low .

in June 2006 , the Committee of Human@@ itarian Aid ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative evaluation in which the author@@ isation of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C ( Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution ) .
this means that Alph@@ eon was a biological drug named R@@ of@@ er@@ one @-@ A with the same medication that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medication &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) Hepatitis C ( one through a virus infection of od@@ or@@ ous liver disease ) .
in a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ tin amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was used to stimul@@ ate this to the formation of active substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon was based on data showing the comparison of Alph@@ eon with R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of drugs , drugs , safety , and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with Hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference doctor to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study measured how many patients were evaluated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment on the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 e @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or Distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business units only . the EMEA is : what were the biggest concerns caused by CH@@ MP to drive the approval for transport ?
furthermore , concerns were reported that the data will not suff@@ ice to the stability of the drug and of the market@@ able drug .
the number of patients with Hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alph@@ eon and R@@ of@@ eron @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease returned to more patients than with the shipping agent ; Alph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test was reported to investigate the question , in which the medicine was an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( one with a cruci@@ fying formation of incoming skin infection ) and small infected cal@@ ami@@ ties ( redness or chi@@ pped ) , s@@ lugg@@ ish and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because alarm go is potentially not effective against this kind of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go is used in patients under the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not be able to treat skin surface area more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it acts by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was delayed after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected household goods , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together , about 90 % of the patients were treated in both groups .
in these two studies , however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ans ( cor@@ rupted in body tissue ) or of infection , which were demon@@ stra@@ bly , or probably caused by MR@@ SA , is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go has reached the short @-@ time surface of the following superf@@ icial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small la@@ er@@ ations , s@@ lugg@@ ish , or paraly@@ sed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients who have no improvement in between two or three days are to be investigated again and an alternative therapy is considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tis@@ ation or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is broken carefully , the sal@@ be carefully decrease and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections when MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary in@@ appropriate open wounds the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ cocc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot .
the impact of the simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
because of the low plas@@ tic@@ ular concentrations , which were reached after a top@@ ical application of the poor skin or infected superf@@ icial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous activity of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the poor of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to the top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ iz@@ ations are not used to be used when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive capacity after oral ing@@ es@@ tion and are in@@ sufficient in relation to implic@@ ations for the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin of the gift of an systemic antibiotic .
if the breast@@ feeding is resum@@ ed / ended , the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is resum@@ ed / ended , between the use of a nursing inf@@ ant and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the women .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most commonly reported adverse event at the administration resort that concerned about 1 % of the patients .
active method Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ om@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding agency of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes , which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the bond of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bind@@ ed station and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Center .
due to binding on this binding station P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , partial P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education active 50s @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the local pre@@ val@@ ency of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some Inf@@ ection forms may appear , a advice by experts should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din should be considered .
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be was placed daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and un@@ f@@ lowed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days to the top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were won .
the sampling was carried out in 3 or 4 of the adult patients each time prior to medi@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system intake on humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es has been primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses existing vaccines , where protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immune to immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , and it is ensured that the vaccine can be led to an end in two doses .
if a refresh@@ er dose is requested for Hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vaccines have effect in destroying the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; how it can fight against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the virus and the surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults since 1996 and has been the approved Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to protect the same illnesses , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered in one out of three doses existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are contained identical substances , some of the data supported by the application of Twin@@ rix adults , are also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indi@@ an for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , who developed a protective antibody after the last injection a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injec@@ tions .
ambi@@ rix led a month after the final injection of hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated one month after the last injection of the development of hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ ence was similar with a sixth and 12 @-@ month gap between the injec@@ tions .
the most common side @-@ side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ s ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ ence may not be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals . a permit for placing the Ambi@@ rix in the entire world
the standardi@@ zation plan for the prim@@ rix is made up of two vaccines , with the first dose to be given at the date of choice and the second dose of six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a ris@@ er chim@@ ed both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size order as according to the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
it is not fully assured whether immun@@ ity @-@ prof@@ icient persons who require an hepatitis B vaccine , which require al@@ timeter as a protection since they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory due to immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injection vaccine , for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction , following the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
if a qu@@ icker protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with immune system disorders , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody is achieved so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required .
because an intra@@ oral injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to an sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus which should be avoided , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular gift .
if ambi@@ ence was administered in the form of a separate injec@@ tions at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ in@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients suffering from immune defects have to be assumed that potentially no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study , which has been carried out with 3 vaccines in this formulation , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ oria , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ ang and preser@@ vative added vaccine form@@ ul@@ ating .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccination outlets were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix are compared with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ s on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the Ambi@@ ence of Ambi@@ rix in 50,@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination vaccine .
after the complete vaccination cycle reported 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects had been given to the ambi@@ ence over pain , over 6@@ 3.8 % had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ tin combination vaccine .
the frequency of mat@@ oria , however , was comparable high ( i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects who received ambi@@ ence compared with 3@@ 6.2 % compared to the subjects who received 3 doses of combination ) .
the frequency of distinctive pain and mat@@ oria was low and comparable to that , after administration of the combination vaccine , it was observed with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- 11 @-@ year @-@ old vaccination , the occurr@@ ence of local re@@ actions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was observed .
however , with the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , after vaccination with ambi@@ rix a number of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vaccines which reported about severe adverse events during the 2 @-@ doses vaccination with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface treatments reported was not different .
in clinical trials involving vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years were the ser@@ otonin @-@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 @-@ passed dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for month 6 @-@ passed dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 years old , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were obtained the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 289 people whose immun@@ o@@ gene@@ ity was imp@@ acted , the serum rates ( SP in table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with its ambi@@ ence .
the immune response , which was reached in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , these vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with its ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs were detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambi@@ ence in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme .
the immune reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the vaccine that was diagnosed with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ an A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dose of 0,5 ml .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral , food and drinks , but can also be transferred by other ways , such as Baden @-@ contam@@ inated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , ambi@@ rix cannot protect completely from an infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , is ( though you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill at the time of the vaccination date ) may not prevent any illness .
any protection against other infections that damage the liver or symptoms that are similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be im@@ par@@ ted .
• If your child already has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the pre@@ valent administration of the second vaccination dose ) .
for a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second in@@ oc@@ ulation , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ ance .
instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced level of effective investigation ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content to effective measures will typically be given a month after the first dose and is likely to give your child a vaccination protection against the vaccination series .
sometimes ambi@@ tions suffer from persons who suffer from serious blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected in muscle . if you have weak@@ ened / your child due to a illness or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child will under@@ pull themselves a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ ence can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the response is to vaccination .
21 S@@ ort your doctor if you are taking another drug / taking part ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or that is planned in the near future .
however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and therefore the person is not opposed to one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible such lim@@ bs .
if Ambi@@ rix are given at the same time or just before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
generally , ambi@@ ence will not be administered or lact@@ ating women unless they are vacc@@ inated for Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated doses ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort in the set @-@ up or redness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • loss of appetite • loss of appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated doses ) : • swelling of the injec@@ tions of fever ( above 38 ° C ) • sin@@ cer@@ ess • gastro@@ intestinal disorders
further side effects , the days or weeks after the in@@ oc@@ ulation with comparable combination or individual im@@ pregn@@ ation against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 recorded doses ) are :
these include locally limited or extensive reports that can be ju@@ cken or cre@@ mation , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing , or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure fall and loss of consciousness .

23 Information your doctor or pharmac@@ ists , if one of the listed side effects you / your child are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice any side effects that are not listed in this package hier@@ archy .
ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les available .
based on the data , which has become known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the in@@ verter , the CH@@ MP ce@@ ases that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix has been released only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug may be limited to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia may also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ text ( brain damage caused by high am@@ moni@@ ac concentrations ) in history .
ammon@@ ia is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed , mixed with the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the abdominal wall ) or a nose probe ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ apps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo medication , i.e. without the active substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ sis may also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liqu@@ e@@ tion , taste disorders , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash or un@@ comfortable body od@@ or or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ itarian S@@ elec@@ tor ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ apps in patients were effective in patients with the u@@ rea resolution of high am@@ moni@@ als .
Am@@ mon@@ sis was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , because due to the rare disease of the condition at the time of approval only limited information to this drug .
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme has already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 living days ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ fold form ( in@@ complete enzyme defective , which manifest itself after the first life of life ) there is then an indication for the use when in the history of a hyper@@ text of en@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ um lack of carb@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ inine in a dose of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of oil s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , if the tablets do not immediately arrive in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which is the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied for patients with con@@ com@@ pres@@ sive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and o@@ dom@@ ination of clinical conditions with caution .
since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and to a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be found whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate is eliminated in human breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ wanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not related to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lact@@ ating acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of excess dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) was a case of an excessive dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which showed intraven@@ ous neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity with intraven@@ ous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic is a metabolic active link formed by acet@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is eliminated by the kidneys .
inhi@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally is comparable to u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the u@@ rea cycle may be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and early , and treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical results .
the forecast of the early mani@@ f@@ ical form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ less an@@ alogy within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ rous oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , proteins reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase survival rate of new@@ born patients in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) .
in patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ text , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many intellectual disability or other neurological defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ ous form of the disease ( including female patients with het@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ zy@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ text of en@@ cephal@@ opathy , and after that were treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurological condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys enzy@@ matic , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to an individual dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in empty healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single return and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic .
according to an oral dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma cutting by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ opath@@ ies , after different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in plasma in the next morning after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis that repeated having been treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in the plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
de@@ position The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated production Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate showed no kl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets ) or were given a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nose probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum should be held within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ um lack of carb@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ty bam@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
if rat failed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active met@@ abo@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , it came to les@@ ions in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the c@@ ort@@ ex .
an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lact@@ ating acid , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , periph@@ eral neurop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
mes@@ chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
based on examinations concerning the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the u@@ rea cycle may be assumed that for each gram , poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurological condition may occur .
according to an oral dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma cutting by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
for this purpose the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient must receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot reverse the sti@@ ck@@ led waste products , depending on the consumption of proteins in the body .
if at your laboratory studies , you have to inform the doctor that you may have AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you are taking other medicines or have taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the breast@@ feeding , you cannot take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine could pass through the breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , dis@@ orient@@ ations , memory disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logic states were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , you immediately put your doctor or with the listing of your hospital to receive a corresponding treatment .
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , you will take the corresponding dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , irregular skin od@@ or , skin rash , kidney function , weight gain , and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists when one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may observe side effects that are not listed in this manual information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS based on the cardboard box and the case according to &quot; using the expi@@ ration date .
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and the contents of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills are made of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( an abnormal measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered , and the in@@ fusion may be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with anxiety or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) , and they received other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
for the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
patients who under@@ go a PCI was equally effective in relation to all indicators as Hep@@ arin , except with severe bleeding , where it was clearly more effective than h@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ines or any other components .
it cannot be applied to patients who have recently had a blood pressure , as well as in people with heavy high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is at the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is a acceptable replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd submitted an approval for the placing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ do inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) in case of an emergency , or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is performed in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of surgery .
based on clinical requirements , the reduced incidence of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the en@@ cro@@ achment .
the recommended dosage for angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ etus of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended , even if a quick PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to below 225 seconds , a second bolt securing is 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to decrease the occurr@@ ence of low ACT values , the re@@ con@@ stituted and dil@@ uted pharmac@@ euticals before use should be mixed and administered intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with severe kidney problems ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to a PCI ( if treated with bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine vs. ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0,3 mg / kg is sufficient to date and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose .
in patients with severe kidney damage caused by the II@@ I@@ - PCI Express study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT was 5 minutes following the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ ization on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis of patients is angi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox takes 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ ction h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of Lower Hep@@ arin .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the substance or any other ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ edings or incidence of blood risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly bacterial diseases . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though using PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in most bleeding problems arise on arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation , patients who under@@ go a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ er@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ ative ratio ) should be taken in order to ensure that the value of the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in is once again achieved prior to the treatment level .
based on the knowledge on the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ eman@@ cip@@ es ( h@@ ep@@ arin , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) may be assumed that these active ingredients may increase blood risk .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in combination with Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ eman@@ cip@@ es are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ atic parameters in any case regularly check .
animal experiments are in@@ sufficient in terms of impact on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , in@@ corporate or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in group as well as in h@@ ep@@ ar@@ ine @-@ treated compar@@ isons , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than with male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measures for heavy bleeding , as defined in Table 2 foot@@ notes .

an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy blood pressure was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood concentration of ≥ 4 g / dl with a well @-@ known blood control station , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in spi@@ ration of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l. with known blood control , re@@ operation due to a blood flow , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0,1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following data on side @-@ side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with biop@@ sy in 6000 patients who under@@ go a PCI .

An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ at@@ or , which bin@@ ds both on the cataly@@ tic centre as well as on the Ani@@ on@@ enb@@ ind@@ ind@@ rical region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or to Ger@@ inn@@ sel .
the binding of bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible because th@@ rom@@ mb@@ in s@@ ails gradually spread the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) to the abdominal wall , the upper th@@ igh@@ s , or the upper arm inj@@ ected with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose pi@@ p@@ eg@@ s ( sugar ) in the blood , or cannot handle insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly of human insulin , and the change means it is faster and a shorter period of work has a short @-@ term human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin . in two studies , with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes where the body insulin does not work effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indi@@ an for its effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ kos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the remaining components , or patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ glyc@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH to bring an approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or dol@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the field of abdominal pain .
because of the reduced glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin metabolism , insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function may be lowered .
any change of the active force , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin delivery ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc del@@ ays etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can move into a change of insulin needs .
3 A inadequate dose or breakdown of treatment , particularly in patients with a insulin intake , can lead to a hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type or an insulin delivery of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can be necessary a change of dosage .
the time of the occurr@@ ence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change during transformation of the treatment scheme .
the substances which can increase blood glucose levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , fiber @-@ in @-@ converting enzyme , fi@@ br@@ ate , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , s@@ ali@@ y@@ lic ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , among the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as bed lock@@ up , Cl@@ oni@@ dine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reserve pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen are weak@@ ened or absent .
animal experiments on reproductive mac@@ ular studies showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ ls occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur neither in mother &apos;s milk , nor is absorbed after oral application .
below are the findings of the adverse effects listed in clinical trials ( exceeding common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on basis of the available data is not inv@@ al@@ u@@ able ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y Will fails to change the injection site within the injection process , can appear in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be given by a intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ tic or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose jection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as through the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be carried out in effect and the mode of mode is shorter than in hu@@ u@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ on , insulin resistance showed up to a dose of propor@@ tion@@ ate glucose effect of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 e / kg , a proportional increase in glucose effects , precisely as human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete drau@@ ght effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data , it was clearly shown that when an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable hier@@ o@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which will be 30 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal was taken , a better post @-@ den@@ ial control was given than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
insulin delivery is administered in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin delivery in every 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : before ) before the meal was given at the beginning of the meal , 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : after@@ ward ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) .
