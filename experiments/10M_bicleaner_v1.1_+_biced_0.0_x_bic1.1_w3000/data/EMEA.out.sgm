<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Employment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Humanitarian Selector (CHMP) will be evaluated in order to get recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the packing box (also part of the EPAR) or apply to your doctor or pharmacists.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want further information regarding the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as injectionable injections (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Shores thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and insulations; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental illness, in which the patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal clusters) have alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, Abilify is used to treat medium-severe panic episodes and to prevent Manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for fast control of controlled agitation or behavioral disorders if the oral medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be used to inhale or melting the melting tablets, which the swallowing of tablets has been prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify should be adjusted the dose of Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as a "partial agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but lower than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic symptoms and retinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent the re-appear symptoms, was investigated in three studies over a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased restlessness over a period of two hours compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared with Haloperidol in another study on 347 patients with Haloperidol in another study to prevent the efficacy of Abilify and placebo in which the manic symptoms were already stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was carried out in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder, who suffered at increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change of patients in patients were examined using a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies involving the injection solution showed patients who received Nlify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased turbulence than patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was reduced in four of the five short-time studies of some symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition to 74 weeks, Abilify was more effective than placebo perceived to be more effective than placebo in previously treated patients and if it was additionally given to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections were reduced in 10- or 15 mg doses, also more effective than placebo perceived the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (constant motion), headache, water secretion (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manical episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes, with whom the manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole expressed in comparison to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in quick control of controlled anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manpolar episodes in case of bipolar-I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted an authorization for the company Otpka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder treatment was not detected at 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the larger sensitivity of these patients group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justifies this. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the onset or after change of antipsychotic therapy, including the treatment of Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder had no increased viewpoints with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole ought to be applied for patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, congestion disease), cerebrovascular diseases, cerebral failure (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure reduction drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dysentery: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there was occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dysentinence, should be drawn up to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient developed signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without any additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, Aripiprazole should be applied in patients with seizures in the history of history, with seizures in connection with the seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole came to placebo compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to undesirovastic events associated with Aripiprazole patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic agents treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, the use of antipsychotics, while weight gain is observed and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system is advisable when Aripiprazole combined with alcohol or other centralised pharmaceuticals in combination with alcohol or other central effects (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is irrelevant as clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to expect other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoroxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore ought to be carried out similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism can use the common application using high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations by Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should weigh potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteashibitors, must have similar effects and therefore ought to be carried out similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">Based on the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosishöhe before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escuopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a moderate increase in the arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on metabolism of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethomorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">The patients should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data protection for the human being and due to the resulting data protection studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of dangerous engines, including power vehicles, to use until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative effect on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were common (≥ 1 / 100) than in placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below are defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a long-term study of more than 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisia, Dystony and Dyskiningrad, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% was diagnosed in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% were treated in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Halopidol treatment.</seg>

<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo which occurred potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters, yielded no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The adverse events that can appear in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dymium magicians, and seizures, unwanted lesrovastic events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdositions were observed with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without any death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis treatment with Aripiprazole. however, it is unlikely to use hadialysis in treating a non-dose, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptor and a antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an excessive affinity to the dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergen and for histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 up to 30 mg. a daily dose of healthy volunteers showed a dosisation of dosages of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and on the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1.228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half of the Haloperidol controlled trial, 52 of the proportion of the Responses who attended study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measuring values defined as secondary study, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- Depression-scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than on Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of more than 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed significantly higher reduction of declines which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapies with more flexible dose of 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disturbance Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo over 3 weeks to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapies for 12 weeks in patients with a manpolar disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo over placebo which was comparable to placebo or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed 12 a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly over 2 weeks not on lithium or valproat-monotherapy, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing the symptoms of reducing bacterial symptoms with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved a remission with Aripiprazole due to placebo on the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a bipolar relapse.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyfication of Aripiprazole, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshal period is about 75 hours for Aripiprazole on CYP2D6 and about almost 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients had no sexually dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences concerning ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic features of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different common liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect concerning the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw the shots on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity, repeatability, acotoxicity, and candiogenous potential, the pre-clinical data did not recognize any special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which exceeded the maximum dose or exposure when human beings were only limited or no significance for clinical use.</seg>

<seg id="299">Pain in the breast cord, weakness of musculature, abdominal pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the songs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity will be calculated based on a definitive fall in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation between these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules that promotes the cogeneration of microtubules from the tubes indexes and stabilized the microtubules due to their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network that is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin, conveys in the endothelial components in the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been demonstrated that the presence of Albumin developed by Paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminreceptor and based on the inuminous protein SPARC (spted protein acidic rich in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumors occurs.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two alone-blinded studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion of allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premediation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">During inclusion in the study 64% of patients had a common condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastasestellen.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy alone, 27% had only a adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% because of metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9. the results for the general response rate and time up to progression free survival and survival for patients who received &gt; First-Line therapy are presented below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity vs. paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy for peripheral neuropathy 3.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for quitting on baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of total-paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active ingredient (AUC) increased more linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous gift of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the paclitaxel plasma concentration to multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extravascular distribution and / or turnout of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumors, pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-quality paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after a solvent paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and fabric coating, Paclitaxel is primarily related to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the mean value of cumulative stimulation 4% of the overall dose with less than 1% of the total metabolism of 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which points to an extensive non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">Patients at the age of more than 75 years, however, only few data are available, since only 3 patients in this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and above light light protected over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="360">Patients with normal blood flow values may be used in connection with a blood transfusion complications, in case of surgery a self-bleeding is not possible and in which a blood-loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with seamed has to be conducted under the supervision of a physician, which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and patients who want to have a self-bleeding, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be carried out by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and patients who receive chemotherapy, the haemoglobite values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilite during adults and 11 g / dl of children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be given for the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or patients with kidney problems may be a anemia caused by a erythropoietinmangel or caused that the body does not sufficiently concern the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of Epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with an injection of 479 patients receiving kidney problems caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All those participating in this study was injected for at least eight weeks, Eprex / Erypo was injected in a vein before they were either transferred to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">Main Indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hemoglobite values between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">In addition, the company also laid the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin speckled abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo was studied with 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused anemia, the haemoglobite values of patients, which were converted to Abseamed, were maintained in the same degree as in those patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison to this, the patients who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo received an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of an encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, side winding, headache, and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against epetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, as further studies are required to ensure that these are caused by allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that it has been provided for abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, the Abseamed, will be provided for medical specialists in all Member States of information, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusions in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who received chemotherapy, and the risk of transfusion due to the general state (for example, cardiovascular status, preexisting anemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient for the required larger operational surgery (4 or more units blood for women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">As a result of a foreign orthopedic treatment, Abseamed can be applied in an adult orthopaedic treatment in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion applications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood-loss of 900-1800 ml can be applied, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration lies between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pädiatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Angiography symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease-load; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease status is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients may occasionally be observed with individual haemoglobite values above or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobbivariability, about a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobite value increased by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobbine value 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) exceeds the epoxetine-alfa dose by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be supervised in order to ensure that epoxetalfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of anaemia and anesysymptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with the initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with which initial anemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>

<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobbivariability, about a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be supervised in order to ensure that epoxetalfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of the symptoms of angible symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks of the hemoglobbum value increased at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the vertical number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, the dose of 150-kg / kg should be maintained a week or 450 kg / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobbination increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the vertical number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 mg / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 g / kg three times a week of the hemoglobbum increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the tap count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 g / kg should be retained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobite value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the precluuloot count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, an appeal to the epetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the prescribed deposits of ≥ 4 blood conservatives is required, deseamed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before operating surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood flow program - started to be available before the start of the seamed therapy of large iron reserves.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 g / kg epetin alfa, which should be given once a week of three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and day of surgery (Day 0).</seg>

<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anticated PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden reloss, defined as a reduction of transfusions (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased demand for transfusions, the reproductive value should be investigated and the usual causes for failure (iron, follicles, or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value, considering the anemia (i.e. the retikulocytes "Index"), which is detected (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / Microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogeneity at subcutaneous use of Abseamed for patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 For patients with chronic renal insufficiency should not be exceeded in the 4.2-recommended limit of hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased mortality rate and risk of serious cardiovascular diseases were observed when erythropoese stimulating active ingredients (ESA) were given to a hemoglobite target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit that is due to the gift of epochs, if the hemoglobin concentration will be increased to control of the symptoms and avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobite rise should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidensely coronary heart disease or insufficiency should not be exceeded in the 4.2 recommended limit of the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="419">Following the present knowledge, anemia is not accelerated by the treatment of anemia with epherine alfa in adults with renal insufficiency which are not dialyzed for progression of kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patient, chemotherapy was supposed to take into account for the assessment of the treatment efficiency of epetin alfa, a 2 - 3-week delay between epetin-alfa gift and erythropoetin response (patients who need to be transflawed).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2 of patients with chemotherapyable anemia - dose adjustable between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit risk-risk of involvement in the respective patient who should consider the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are earmarked for a bigger type of orthopedic treatment, if possible, before the start of the epherine-alfa therapy, the cause of anemia were examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who have undergone a bigger elective orthopedic treatment, should have an adequate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have increased risk for thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in a basic cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be excluded that treatment with epherine alfa for patients with a source-foglobite value of &gt; 13 g / dl can consist of increased risk for postoperative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>

<seg id="429">In-vitro tests on tumor cells, there are no indication of an interaction between epetin alfa and G-CSF or GM CSF regarding haematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic diseases such as myocardiology, vascular events such as myocardiology, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, lung cancer, aneuristhrombals and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys, was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under ephereditary alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epetin alfa is a dosisdependent increase in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertonia.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of rombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under the treatment of erythropoetinen.</seg>

<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responses at the end of the six-month study (on the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with risk-treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic address given at 141 of patients treated with aclasta, compared with 71 of patients treated with risedronate treated patients suffer from an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes permanent infusions of 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg of zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dosishable.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma bar decreased rapidly at &lt; 10% of peak value to 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0,1% of the peak.</seg>
<seg id="647">Fast-phase disappearance of the large circulation system with half-half hours t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1.87 hours, followed by a long Elimination phase with a period of elimination bracket for ½ hours of ½ hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above 1 ½ -values) represent probably the fast resorption in the bones and the excretion of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the recommended dose in urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance is independent from the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the cell acidic acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (Plasmaonzentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by using cytochrome P450 enzyme systems metabolic substances is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolic and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or irreversible, material-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine-Clearance, and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It turns out that a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a medium kidney function until down to a creatinine-Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the oledronic acid requires.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in patients (in particular overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) can be used together with another diabetes drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">Additionally, it can be used in addition to metformin patients (in particular overweight patients) that can not be satisfying with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa drugs or insulin, the previous dose of sulfa drugs or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of sulfa drugs or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin is better tolerated and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfa drugs, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies the concentration of a substance in blood (glyphylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value which suggests that the blood sugar levels of dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study the effect of an additional gift of Actos to existing treatment with metformin and a sulfa drugs in a lowering of the HbA1c values increased by 0.94% while the additional treatment of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin decreased, compared with 0.69% after 6 months compared to placebo compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were blurred vision, infections of upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (decreased sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be applied in patients that are possibly sensitive (allergic) against pioglitazon or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketones - infringement - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (in some use) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients, where metal does not appear.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for placing Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, their blood sugar with insulin inadequate and where metformin is inappropriate for contraindications or tolerability (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, so the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), a physician should commence treatment with the lowest dose, and increase the dose of continuously increasing dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, or edema, especially those with a reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema, when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular study involving pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and existing macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror reaches up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymatic values are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">In case a patient symptoms are designed to refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach pains, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark harn, are the liver enzymatic values.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patients with pioglitazon continued, should be led by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, a dosisation weight gain has been detected, which can stir in fat-deposits and is linked in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hematology (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative study with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3.6-4.1%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients who have pioglitazon as oral or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylharnye or as a double combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosisation hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the introduction of the treatment with Thiazoldindians, including Pioglitazon, has been reported to report an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but the possibility of a macular edema should be aware when patients report on disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of notifying events of adverse events, randomised, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 years of patients treated with pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patients with women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, questionnaires were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractions per 100 patient) of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients with 23 / 905 (0.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient is a pregnancy or a patient, the treatment is abusing (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigating the interaction have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics from digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs which are posed by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium canvblocker and HMGCoA-Reductasinhibitor are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of AUC of Pioglitazon for 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a decrease of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is primarily attributable to treatment with pioglitazon which reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of breast cancers and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for freddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and of the lens indexes, as they can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazon, ALT arrivals occurred over three times the upper limit of the standard range far as often as placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnye.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing macrovascular disease was the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone by 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon bzw was followed.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rarely has been reported about heart failure under Pioglitazon, but frequently when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the history.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of notifying events of adverse events, randomised, randomised, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients treated with comparative groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing PROACTIVE study, questionnaires were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">At intake, the maximum dose of 120 mg / day took over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific kernel receptors (Peroxisome Proliferation) Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)) which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin sensitiveness of liver, fat and skeleton cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study involving Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic efficacy (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazon in 69% of patients treated (versus 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient, despite three-month optimization, was randomly allocated to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c is reduced by 0.45% compared to patients who continue to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over one year, there was a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin-Quotides compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, checked up to 18 weeks of study on type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- Cholesterinspiegel as well as slightly, clinically significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced in comparison to placebo, metformin or gliclazid, the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel, whereas under metformin and gliclazid were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone also reduced triglycerides but also improved triglyceride level, this is also improved on triglyceride absorption as well as to the triglyceride absorption as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiac activity study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing macrovascular disease were randomised, which received either pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, whereby the top concentrations of the unaltered pioglitazone will usually reach 2 hours after use.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV represents the effectiveness in about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In intervention studies, pioglitazone could not have relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics from digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8-Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases and reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Based on radioactive Pioglitazon, the marker was found mainly in the Fäs (55%) and found at a lower extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination bracket for unchanging Pioglitazon is 5-6 hours, and that of the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma-centration of pioglitazon and its metabolites are low in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearing of breast substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, according to repeated pre-volume plasma enlargement with hematelution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophie.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with Pioglitazone reduces hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast canceled and reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for freddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) the rat increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urethepithelium epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazoldindians led to an increased frequency of colonizers.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study about 3.5 years for investigation of cardiovascular events, questionnaires were treated with 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractions per 100 patient) of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients with 23 / 905 (0.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patients) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin combination with Pioglitazon or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, there was a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotides in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only increase the yield triglyceride level, but also improved the post-denounces triglyceride level, this has a effect on the tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic tryglizard synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing on its primary endpoint, a combination of total mortality, non-deadly myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary arisation and reascular arisation of leg arteries, put results close to that with the intake of pioglitazon no cardiovascular risk of cardiovascular risk.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant-effects or to an increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immune suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always be retained the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dose; Modification of the formulation or of the regime should be made only under the engaging control of an experienced medical device (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">In a consequence of a transition to alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As the kidney function has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Because of nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum concentration, calculation of the creatininlets and monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin on Advagraf In the transition from a Ciclosporin on a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable to be careful (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the valley mirror in full blood. the dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of shock-shocking and tolerability in individual case using full blood pressure tacrolimus controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform common controls on the Tacrolimus Talmud during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by the Prograf on Advagraf, Dosiscustomization, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or even when used substances which could change the Tacrolimus Consumption ration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Because Advagraf is a drug with a low Clearance, customization of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials make sure that successful treatment in most cases is possible, when the valley levels are not exceeded in the blood of 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time according to liver transplantations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with heart rate and heartfelt patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">Blood concentrations in the range of 5-15 ng / ml were generally used during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney, and transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to serious adverse events, including transplant-shoots or other side effects, which can appear in succession of tacrolimus under- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always be retained the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dose; Modification of the formulation or of the regime should be made only under the engaging control of an experienced medical device (see section 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">Prophylaxis of transplant transplantation with adult cortransplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood are still no clinical data for retardent formulation.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that can lead to a lowering of the tacroclimate levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the use of herbal supplements (Hypericum perforatum) is included, or other plant breeding are avoided during treatment with advaginas (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Patients with diarrhoe is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentration in the blood since the tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, it was described as a Kardiomyopathy chamber or septic hypertrophie, which can therefore also occur among advaginas.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are a already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver function, infections, liquid load and odies.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the influence of sunlight or UV light should be reduced due to suitable clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advances will be used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one by the lack of factor VIII, congenital blood pressure disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of application will be addressed, whether Advate is applied to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems like bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but according to a method known as "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been brought to the formation of the human line factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advances is similar to another in the European Union of approved drug named rebinate, but is similar, however, that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advates in preventing bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepisodes with "excellent" or "good" rated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances must not be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against human brain factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the remaining components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG to offer an approval for the advent of Advates in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage: dosage and duration of the substitution of the factor VIII-Mangel, after the place and the extent of blood and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall under the appropriate plasma levels (in% of the norm or in i.e. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours of patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment, the dose of anti-inflammatory dose and the frequency of injection is appropriate to determine the factor VIII-Plasmastic.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A are to be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kilogram of body weight in 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII is not achieved, or if the bleeding is not governed with a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to verify an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic interventions must be eradicated.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing rate should be addressed after the patient, where a maximum injection-rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the projected activity of factor VIII, ignorant, which was quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Developing the risk of developing inhibitors, correlated with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposition stage is on the biggest and of genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 externalities and anamnestically known inhibitorisation, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII-Product to another, reappear of (humiliating) inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women over the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding have no experiences yet.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the initial approval of available data, the CHMP has evaluated the benefit risk provisioning as a positive value, but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored in the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP is required on the basis of the ADVATE security profile that requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the marketing owner should apply another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Human Rights (CHMP) that the company takes its application for approval for the advent of Advance of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the soft parts (tissues, connects other structures in the body, surrounded and based) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which is so changed that there is no copies of itself and therefore no infection can trigger in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advances in tumours could be injected directly into the tumors and allow cancer cells to restore normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defect in the human body of the p53 gene, usually contributes to restore damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can't be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells could continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient, with the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the area of sub-construction, in bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers from the company on which questions had checked, were still some questions unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP on Day 120 creates a list of questions which will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">After the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni-Tumors bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee had further concerns on the processing of the medicine in the body, type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in general contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company does not bet the CHMP in knowledge if the withdrawal for patients who currently work on clinical trials or "Compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified active release" "" "means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective ingredients are immediately released and the other will be released slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergy rhinitis (hay fever, caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal muctival smucskin (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is one tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and end once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug may be refilled to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The most effective measurements were the changes in the severity of the hypocriterious symptoms, which were reported from patients before the beginning of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale as hard the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In view of all the locust symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported patients receiving aerinaze, over a decrease of symptoms by 46,0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa were considered, the patients below aerinaze showed a alleviation of symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common adverse events of Aerobaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are Tachykarst (cornea), stipation, headache, fatigue, Insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (insomnia), insomnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenerge molecular entities or Loratadine (a different medicines for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must not be used in patients who suffer from a bottlenticular glaucoma (increased blood pressure), hyperthyrosis (hyperblood pressure), hyperthyrosis (hyperblood pressure), hyperthyrosis (hyperblood pressure caused stroke) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company SP Europe, approval for the placing of Aerinaze within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is not to swallow on the whole (i.e. without them to break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerobaze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to misuse and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after deducting the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as for a long-term application the activity of Pseudoephedrine can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the drop in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory system, treatment with desloratadine can be continued as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetetic activity of combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconglomerate such as bromocripitin, pergolid, Lisuride, cabergolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">Safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective, and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function, and the data is not sufficient to address relevant recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment at the occurrence of hypertension or a speedometer, or any other neurological symptoms, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or an amplification of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">The treatment of the following patient groups is advised to be careful: • Patients under digital disease • Patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardial infarction in the history of diabetes, diabetes mellitus, bladder sobaric or bronchospasmus in history.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must impose at least 48 hours before carrying out the matological tests, since antihistamines can prevent positive reactions to indicators for interactions and reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials involving desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, there were no significant differences in the patients treated with loratadine and treated with placebo regardless of whether desloratadadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for metabolism of desloratadine was not identified yet so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadimpedes in-vivo CYP3A4 uninhibit and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate, nor one inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconcubility of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, yet with a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans, and should not be used in the cause of vasoconstrious properties of Pseudoephedrin, Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">The patients should however be clarified, however, that it may occur in very rare cases to a drowsiness, which can lead to a impairment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanosis, coma, heart-circulation collision) and a CNS abnormality (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, frightening microphone, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preventive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, tendons, and hypotension.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as Atrophine-typical symptoms (oral mixture, pupil rigid and dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human base cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhessionate P-Sine of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including amplification, subjective impact or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily, no increased frequency of sleepiness was observed compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a speedometer or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients with seasonal rhinitis took part in the age of 12 to 78 years with seasonal rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine-agonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined based on the total score for the symptoms (except nasal muginal swellation), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets in regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal muctival smute, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">According to the peroral application of Aerinaze with healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equivalent of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dosisation study, which was carried out with the formulation of a tablet in healthy adult subjects, was found that four volunteers desloratadine was badly damaged.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interact study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine according to the sole gift of Pseudoephedrin after the sole gift of Pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was for exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity with repeated treatment, for acotoxicity and reproductive convolatility, clinical data with desloratadmits have no special dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the effects observed in general related to the compound Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-production studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was the combination of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of Desloratadine, very rare about cases of severe allergic reactions (respiratory, pfeigh breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Over cases of heart palpitations, corchase, stomach pains, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, diarrhea, hallucinations, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, disturbances with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of obtrusive liver values were also very rare reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg- lyophilisat (solvable tablet), 2,5 mg- and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged between one and five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which contains 2.5 ml of syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms (itching, number and size of the paddling, impairment of sleep and efficiency on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, solution for inserting and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application for children unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies have been taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius became an average decrease of the symptom (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urticaria, the decrease of the symptom after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% compared to placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, laureadin or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted SP Europe's approval for placing Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, at alleviation of symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience from clinical trials for the effectiveness of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out in accordance with the previous disease and can be resumed after the end of the symptoms and resumed in their recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended during the pouring of a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interaction were not established in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, treatment of alcoerius and alcohol was not intensified by taking alcohol (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">The patients should not be clarified, however, that it can occur in very rare cases that can lead to a impairment of traffic jams or the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical studies in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, were reported 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius, than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently visited side effects, which was reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue (1,2%) and headache (0.6%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescents from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect of headache, which were treated in 5.9% of patients who were treated with desloratadine and treated with placebo in 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multiple dose study, which up to 45 mg of desloratadine (Neunfold clinical dose) were given no clinical relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human base cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhessionate P-Sine of endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical trial with multiple doses ranging from up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 mg daily, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects were described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in the desloratadine, in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold of clinical trials) was administered over ten days, no extension of the QTc intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1743">At a single dosis- study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables, including amplification, subjective impact or tasks that are associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in the alleviation of symptoms such as nibble, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching, irritation and redness of eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in saisonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis in dependence of the duration of symptoms may also be divided in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week, or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Permeating allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As is shown by the total score of the quality of life on the quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively diminished the severe allergic rhinitis caused by seasonal-allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigating further forms of the Urticaria, because the underlying pathophysiology is similar to ethtiology in different forms, and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine is an elementary factor in all urticular diseases, desloratadine is expected, except with the chronically idiopathic urticaria, also in other forms of the Urticaria to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quotes at the end of the first dose intervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines with chronic idiopathic urticaria, the patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine treated patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and growth significantly, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patients "biographies were comparable to the general saisonous rhinitis-population comparable, was achieved in 4% of patients a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no evidence points for a clinical-relevant cumulation after a daily use of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for metabolism of desloratadine, however, was not identified yet so that interactions with other drugs are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadimpedes in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate, nor one inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with desloratadine at a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fetal, calorie rich breakfast) did not look to the availability of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials demonstrated with Desloratadine and Loratadin, in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the toxicity of desloratadine and Loratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity, repeated treatment, genotoxicity and reproductive maculation, clinical data with desloratadmits have no particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius may be taken independently of meals, including symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see below 4.4) and that there is no data available that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, there should be a role in diagnosis, physical tests and corresponding laboratory and skin tests.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic would be reduced and experienced a higher resolution load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are restricted to metabolic, is identical to children who do normally metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactless absorption, or a sucroase-isomaltase- insufficiency does not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interaction were not established in clinical trials with Aerius tablets where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study NSC 631570 was not increasingly increased by Aerius tablets and alcohol (see below section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">Overall incidence of adverse events with children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup Group, as in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="1893">Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. were officially distributed to the Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) in June 2008 that the company opens its application for approval by Aflunov on the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect influenza, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine, which could cause a stem of the influenza virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus has emerged, which can be easily spread from man, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the immune system in the vaccine as "body foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to form faster antibodies in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">The diaphragm of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on membranes surface, which recognizes the human body as body-foreign) is separated, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study had not been carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">By this, the extent of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA region's guidelines in preventative vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you participate in clinical examination and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you want further information regarding the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are caused by the human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-1) which are caused by the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow the capsules can be used as a solution to inhale, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should be prescribed only if the doctor has examined, which has taken an antiviral medication of the patient previously, and the likelihood is that the virus will appeal to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together twice daily with 100 mg of rite avir and with other antiviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerated is reduced in combination with other antiviral medication, the HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS does not heal, however, the damage to the immune system can, and thus, to do the development of AIDS, infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medication, but without chionavir, investigating two major studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase increased with low dose of drug Agenerase, with 206 adults, who had previously taken proteasinhibitor, compared with other proteasinhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main Indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in blood (viral load) or the change of viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who had previously had taken no proteasinhibitor had had a viral load among 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but of the children who had previously treated with proteastics were very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with proteastics, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other proteasinhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteassures, it came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who had their previous proteasinhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoe (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), Nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase cannot be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against amonavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerators too may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines, which are just as Agenerase and are taken to high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), an osteonecrosis (symptoms of bone tissue) or an immune system syndroid (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Humanitarian Selector (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medication used in combination with different antiretroviral medication treated with HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifiers, but the committee noted that the benefit from Ageneric ase in combination with konavir in patients who had previously not taken protein inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally licensed under "extraordinary circumstances," only limited information at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, Glaxo Group Limited gave the approval to the Glaxo Group Limited, approval for the placing of Agenerators in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1- infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) -treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenerators should be given to pharmacokinetic padding of amonavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amonavir should be achieved using the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pretreatment (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amonavir as a solution for inhalation is 14% lower than one capsule, therefore Ageneric capsules and solution are not interchangeable for one milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg / blown twice daily along with 100 mg of rite cavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase Capsules are used without the enhancing addition of rite cavir (padding), higher doses have to be applied to Agenerated (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amonavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amonavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of astigase in combination with low doses of rite or other protagonists were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to failure of data for unquestionable and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily with moderate liver function for 450 mg twice daily and in patients with heavy liver problems, 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be applied in patients with mild or moderate liver problems with caution, in patients with severe liver function, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerators cannot be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also pose a substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations, the St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma levels and a diminished therapeutic effect of amonavir during intake of amoncavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should not be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy did not lead to a healing of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV towards others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerators should be used together with low doses of rite-avir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral therapy treatment, have increased risk of severe liver intervention with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an equivalent antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this product.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing liver function, including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluorticason or other glucoocorrhoids, which are modulated via CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic-smoking oider effects including Morbus Cushing and suppleression of the adocidal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the material interchangeover of the HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitor and Simvastatin strongly recommended by CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of astagastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rahabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening adverse events, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International normality), are methods to determine the concentration of active concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective for reduced plasma levels of amonavir less (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amonavir can be the effectiveness of hormonal contradication, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amonatorir, patients should therefore be monitored on oppiatentysymptoms, especially if there are also low doses of rite cavities.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity, due to the high progenesis of the Agenerated solution, this formulation is contracted in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be removed for duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including Proteasynmer, has been reported using the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an ecoterbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, to whose therapy drugs were needed, which are associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors such as a longer continuous antiretroviral therapy, associated with metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Haemophiles patients (Type A and B) that were treated with proteasants, reports about an increase of bleeding including spontaneous subcutaneous hematoms and hemmarthroats.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In the time of HIV-infected patients with severe immunotherapy, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an anti-inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infection that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), were reported cases of osteonecrose particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width, should not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a small therapeutic width and also pose a substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be used together with pharmaceuticals, their active ingredients are predominantly associated with CYP2D6 and associated with severe plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicine causes an 82% reduction in AUC of amonavir that can lead to a virological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the lowest plasma levels by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with rite avir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ambaboo can be humiliated by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already entering St John's wort, the Ambavironic mirror and if possible, to check the virusload and add the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not required if Nelfinavir is administered along with ampavir (see also Eguirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">For Cmax, 508% increases, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amonavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg / bbavr were used twice daily and konavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the effectiveness and inconcubility of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">In combination with Kaletra (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopar avir + 100 mg of rite-cavir daily) was given.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amonavir in plasma, which were achieved in combination of amonavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopar avir + 100 mg of caviar (600 mg twice a day) in combination with 100 mg of rite cavir daily is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ambavavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended for engaging monitoring because the effectiveness and uncertainty of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didanese in combination with didanosin, but due to the antazide component of didanese, there are at least one hour apart due to the antazide component (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with Echelavir (600 mg twice a day) and rite cavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose to dose is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Eloadence in combination with amonavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protagonists would be inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other proteasynmer and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin lowers the serum concentration of Ambavavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If this medication should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdine could be less effective because of the diminished or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is necessary; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring will be performed as a precise forecast of the effect of the combination of amonavir and knights on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous development of Ambaboo and Rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmaabutin (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required together with aorase, to reduce the dose of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with intergenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both medications could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of ketoconazole twice daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0%) compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg ketoconazole daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprabazol.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied in common with Agenerase, possibly to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs, if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other Proteasehemmer, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase as it may occur to resoratory disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsva, known as an enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amonavir can lead to a humiliation of the plasma bar of amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, nidipin, nidipin, nidipin, Nispin, nidipin, Nispin, nidipin, Nispin, nidipin, Nispin, Nispin, Nispin, Nispin, Nispin, can increase the activity and toxicity of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake with Agenerase can increase the plasma-centric concentrations in conjunction with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, tendons, and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the rite level 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluorticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) were significantly reduced by approximately 86%, while endogenous cortisol rose by approximately 86% (90% distribution interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended with these glucoocorrhoids, unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic-smoking oider effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose pollution is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are significant increases of plasma levels in simultaneous administration of aorase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasticular increases of these HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors, including a rhubarb olysis, is not recommended to use the combined use of this medicine with amoncavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended to be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations until stabilization of mirrors because the plasma-centration of Cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the same gift of amonavir. (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenerase must not be applied together with oral mdazolam (see Section 4.3), while in the current application of Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam to 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with amidavr, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium acid symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of rite cavities.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low reliability of historical comparisons, there is no recommendation to adapt, such as the amonavir- dose, when Ambavavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">At the same time of warfarin or other oral anticoagulemancipes, together with Agenera, an increased control of the INR (International normative ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or amplification of the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contradication is not predictable, as an alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the benefit of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used during pregnancy only after careful intentions for the mother compared to the potential risks of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, Ambavavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether amonavir is surviving in human breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by insolvency in the uterus until the end of the stagnation period Ambavavir, showed a decreased increase of 12 body weight during the stagnation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of earnings, including fertilization, and reproductive ability, was not affected by the administration of amonavir to the mothertier.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The inconceiability of Agenerase was studied in adults and in children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the treatment-related side-related side effects were slightly up to moderate, rose early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clarified, whether they are related to HIV treatment or any other medicines at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the neutral disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the abovementioned effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), which did not pre-treated patients 1,200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were weighted from the verification than in connection with the study medication, were listed in more than 1% of the patients (grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and toxic fatty tissues, hypertrophie and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophie of the breasts and doras cerebral fat accumulation (sticking).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated individuals who had been treated with amadavr in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks was only one case (sticking) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, 245 NRTI- were treated with 245 NRTI- in comparison to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs above a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually slightly until moderately balanced, erythematous or maculopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously within two weeks, without leaving the treatment with amoncavities.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoneksis mainly reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the time of HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an anti-inflammatory reaction on asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infection (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI treated patients who received 600 mg of acid twice daily with a low dose of rite (100 mg twice daily), were kind and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were common in patients who received Agenerase together with low dose of rite, very often.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is based on signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amonavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and prevents the process of viral viral and gag-polo polyproteins in consequence of a formation of non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in akut and chronic lymphocytic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% natural concentration (IC50) of ammonavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0,08 µm with acute infected cells, and amounts to 0,41 µm with chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amonbavr against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in man is still not defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">For the treatment of antiretroviral therapy with the currently approved Fosampraviolr / Ritonavir dosages - such as with other rite-ooar treatment schemas with proteaseinbitors - the mutations described only rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral therapy, the 700mg of Fosonavir was obtained twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred until week 48, whereby 14 isolates genotypic could be examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a four-rological failure included in the 59, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32V, IO4I / M / T / V, Q58V, D60E, I54V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosonavir / 100 mg / 100 mg) with proteasticus treated patients with virology failure above 96 weeks, the following proteasinhibitor mutations appeared:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypical resistor-based analyses, Genotypic interpretations can be used to estimate the activity of amonavir / knights or Fosamprenavir / rite caviar in patients with proteasinhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir is defined as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, I84V and L90M, I84V and L90M, I84V and L90M as well as a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutations, changes are subject to additional data, and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyse resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on photypical resistor-based analyses, clinically validated phenotypic interpretations can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data on the estimation of the activity of amonavir / konavir / rite caviar in patients with proteasinhibitor resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies to drive diagnostic resistance tests have clinically developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to evaluate the results of a resistance testing.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each four with a reduced sensitivity to amonavir-associated genetic pattern produces a certain crossresistance against rite avir, which remains sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amonavir and other protagonists for all 4 Fosampavir Resisters, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-five antiretroviral therapy, in which a Fosavavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Inadavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Inquavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice-versa, Améavir retains its activity against some other proteastics-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits imposed on the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of Ageneric ase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study (viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml) together with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanaloga (standard of care, soc) with a PI, predominantly with a humiliated rite level.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the study study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SoC-PI Group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subroutine wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the efficacy of untreated Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials with 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In studies, Ageneric solution was used daily for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">It was given no low dose of ayonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study included plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml of a median increase in CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on these data should be considered to be considered to be expected to be considered by the" "" "innocent" "" "Agenerated" "" "treatment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of ammonavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 up to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax, by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amonavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ambavavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of ammonavir 12 hours to dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous dietary intake influenced the extent and the rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and is mounted on a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of ambassist from the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of active substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound amonatavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unused amoncavities remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the dosing intervals in the Steady State in the area of Cmax, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drug may inducing or reduce the CYP3A4 or specify a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution when they are given at the same time with aattase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amusavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amonavir is made of a solution of 14% less bidmt as from the capsules; therefore Ageneric solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligrammar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal clearing of Ritonavir negligible, therefore the impact of a kidney function should be low on the elimination of amonavir and knights.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to amonavir plasma, comparable to those who are blown up to healthy volunteers according to a dose of 1200 mg / bbavr daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity with amonatula in mice and rats joined male animals benigne hepatocellular adenomas in doses of mice (mice) or 3,8- triple (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice a day of 1200 mg of amonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of this observational effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present examination data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, little evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro diagnostics tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphoma test, microcore test to rats and chromosome aberration to human peripheral lymphocytes was Ambavavir neither mutagenic nor genotoxically.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical use of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now in clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in juveniles, which were treated from a age of 4 days, showed both in the control and with the Ambavavir animals treated with high mortality.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systematic Plasmaexposition, significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic doses of humans were observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymus-ongation and lesser skeletal changes were observed on a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase Capsules are used without the enhancing addition of rite cavir (padding), higher doses have to be applied to Agenerated (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara cream has been studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies where dosages were not shown (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic intake of 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during three times weekly use during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest medicine concentrations observed in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totalled 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml, on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bag) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bag).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-time period was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 hour half-year period after the subcutaneous application in a previous study, which indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application to MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable with acute keratosis or superfizial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used to treat patients with sighted diagnosis of a mudysaccharitin I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological symptoms of the disease (symptoms that are not related with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (Glycosaminoglyphkane, gags) will not be dismantled, thus in most organs in the body, and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements make difficult, reduces lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a physician, who possesses experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or hospital with revitation equipment, and patients need to prevent the appropriate medicines in order to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, however, its effectiveness was measured in response to reducing the concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme decreased the gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated at the end of the study a normal big liver.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common adverse events of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthralgia, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat-feeling, fever and reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardie (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not react in patients who are potentially oversensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Each year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will update all new information that may be known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is receiving patients who observe Aldurazyme in terms of reactions to the infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. to bring an approval for the transport of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammals-cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicative for the long-term Encyysaccharification I (MPS I, α-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological symptoms of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this, all 15 minutes in single steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h can be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not identified, and for these patients no dosing scheme is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion reactions that are defined as each related side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should also continue to monitor engmeshy, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should be available only in a reasonable clinical environment, in the revitational facilities for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, almost all patients of IgG antibodies against laronidase are expected, usually within 3 months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience concerning the recovery of treatment after a longer break, it must be cautious because of the theoretically increased risk provisioning after a disruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyraka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate infusion reaction, treatment with anti-histamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen should be carried out and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, heavy infusion-related reaction, infusion must be halted until the symptoms are used to decline with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with an infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are used (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as reducing the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because a potential risk of interference with intracell intake of laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experiments do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns that were exposed to Laronidase over breast milk, is advised to unload during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were given mainly as infusion-related reactions that were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years (duration of up to 1 year) were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme who were observed during Phase 3 study and an extension of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older are listed in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the history there were severe reactions, including bronchospasmus, respiratory shutdown and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unwanted drug effects in connection with Aldurazyme who have been reported in a phase of 20 patients with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with mainly severe flooding and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once per week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, whereby it occurred in the patients under the age of 5, mostly within a month period (on average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (respectively until a premature dropout of the study) were not reported by Radioimmunoplastitation (RIP) Assay's proven antibody, among them 3 patients, with whom it had never been to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low anti-antibody mirror showed a robust reduction in the spag-mirror in the harn while patients with high antibodies were found a variable reduction of gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal until low-neutralizing corrective effect on the enzymatic brain activity in vitro which seemed to significantly affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of gag in Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse medicines, even if the occurrence of adverse medicines typically occurred along with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasons for the enzyme-replacement therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrats, and preventing a further accumulation of enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and cells in lymphoosomes, the most likely about Manni-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were randomized in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the whole disease spectrum, the majority of patients with the middle phenotype and only one patient demonstrated the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had accelerated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected values, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received more 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients were treated with Aldurazyme compared to the placebo group to improve lung function and the capacity that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open renewal study, an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the projected pro-centric FEV is clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionally to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with one hepatomic atomic therapy reached 22 (85%) until the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the gag-mirror in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinine) has remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of heterogeneous disease values between the patients receiving a combined final frequency (at the anticipated level of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">It was conducted an open Phase 2 study, mainly investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study at 5 years old (16 patients with heavy displacement form and 4 with the middle course form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 e / kg due to increased GAG- mirror in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was found according to the Z score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium stroke rate indicate a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe wiring form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study investigations were performed to pharmacodynamic effects of different Aldurazyme-dosing scheme on the gag-mirror in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once per week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The Dosification scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be represented in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions, a justifiable alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing scheme is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will specify any new information that will be available, annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity in unique gift, toxicity with repeatability and reproductive maculation, the pre-clinical data cannot realize special dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2360">Converting Pemetremixed in its active form is easier to fit in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations in the active form of medication and longer mode of cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">The treatment of the Malian Pleuramesothelioma was investigating Alimta in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta resulted in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>

<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to sufficient data for unquestionable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a Kreatinine-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose-adaptations were necessary to carry out the recommended dose adjustment for all patients recommended dose.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinine-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- border value and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (with metastasis of liver metastasis) were not examined especially in studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in regard to the bone-market suppression and Pemetremixed can not be administered to patients before their absolute neutral number is again attained a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Thrombo- Cypriot has achieved a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutral number, Thrombocytic number and maximum non-haemological toxicity, as they were observed in previous treatment cycles. (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A less toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hematological and non-malignity toxicity, such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutrropenie was regarded when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients have to be treated with Pemetremixed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophyllactic measure to reduce unbalanced toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Kreatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous non-steroid Antiphlogiska (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, the day of therapy and mindless than 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2402">Therefore, be careful when in patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on day of therapy and minding, 2 days after therapy with pemetremixed must be avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interactions with NSAIDs with long half-value such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- xed to be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the brain status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulemancipes and antineoplastic chemotherapy require increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International normative ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient ducks with oral anticoagulemancipation.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of aloxi can be increased by the extra gift of a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years is not recommended, as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance that prevents the substance of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three major studies of 1 842 adult investigating chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients who were treated with aloxi were not vomiting (132 by 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting proved, 81% of the patients treated with aloxi were not vomiting (153 of 189), 69% of those treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in severe emetogenic chemotherapy, due to a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetoed chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be strengthened by adding a corticosteroids before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon display, patients with amnesty law or signs of an acute ileus should be monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, like with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable in the current gift of Palonosetron with drugs that extend the QT interval or patients with which the QT- interval lengthens or tend to be an extension.</seg>

<seg id="2625">Experiences about the application of Palonosetron in human gestures are not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied for pregnant women unless it is considered to be treated by a treat doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common subjects were observed in a dose of 250 microgram (total of 633 patients) which, at least possibly with aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity and reactions at the administration location (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-sales reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar symptoms of adverse events demonstrated as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out because of the major distribution volume, however, a dialysis probably does not have an effective therapy at a Aloha overdozation.</seg>

<seg id="2634">According to the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron owns the ability to block the Iventricular de- and repolarisation of the ion channels and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EKG effects of I.V. aborted palonosetron in single doses ranging from 0,25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows an initial decrease in the Plasmaonzentacian initial reduction in the body with an average maturity of half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrate time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally distributed in the total dose range of 0.3- 90 m / kg with dogs and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, 5 measured average (± SD) was measured from the Palonosetron plasma concentration in 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">The pharmacokinetic simulations come out that at once daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonosetron reached in 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with which after one-time intravenous administration reached 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was higher after the input of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated about the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies of metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 are involved in a lesser extent that are involved with CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After one-time intravenous Bolusinject, the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver function have increased the terminale elimination-value and the average Systemic exposure with Palonosetron, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions that are considered to be adequately viewed over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of pre-clinical trials, indications that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of ion channels which can be involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the action duration.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose was given to about 30fold of the therapeutic exposure when people), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumor, endocro, pancreas, adnierenmark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high dosages and as Aloxi when people use a unique application, relevance of these results is low.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee of Humanitarian Aid (CHMP) approved a negative evaluation in which the authorisation of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C (Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution).</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was a biological drug named Roferone-A with the same medication that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medication").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-term) Hepatitis C (one through a virus infection of odorous liver disease).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation indicates the liver tissue damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alantin aminotransferase (ALT) increases in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was used to stimulate this to the formation of active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon was based on data showing the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active structure, composition and purity of drugs, drugs, safety, and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with Hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference doctor to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">In the study measured how many patients were evaluated after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment on the medicine (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 e-mail: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or Distribution of this document is Authorised for non business units only. the EMEA is: what were the biggest concerns caused by CHMP to drive the approval for transport?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns were reported that the data will not suffice to the stability of the drug and of the marketable drug.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with Hepatitis C who spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon retardant the disease returned to more patients than with the shipping agent; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test was reported to investigate the question, in which the medicine was an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of impetigo (one with a crucifying formation of incoming skin infection) and small infected calamities (redness or chipped), sluggish and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarm go is potentially not effective against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo is used in patients under the age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not be able to treat skin surface area more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It acts by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterienzelle where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main Indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of patients whose infection was delayed after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected household goods, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together, about 90% of the patients were treated in both groups.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, in these two studies, Altargo was found in the treatment of abscans (corrupted in body tissue) or of infection, which were demonstrably, or probably caused by MRSA, is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation to the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo has reached the short-time surface of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, infected small laerations, sluggish, or paralysed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a approval for the transport of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients who have no improvement in between two or three days are to be investigated again and an alternative therapy is considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitisation or severe local irritation by the use of retapamulin Salbe the treatment is broken carefully, the salbe carefully decrease and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections when MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary inappropriate open wounds the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2-3 day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The impact of the simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Because of the low plasticular concentrations, which were reached after a topical application of the poor skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous activity of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the poor of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to the topical application in patients, Dosiscustomizations are not used to be used when topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive capacity after oral ingestion and are insufficient in relation to implications for the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin of the gift of an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the breastfeeding is resumed / ended, the therapy with Altargo is resumed / ended, between the use of a nursing infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo was used, the most commonly reported adverse event at the administration resort that concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Active method Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitomus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a specific binding agency of the bacterial ribosomes, which differs from the binding of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the bond of ribosomales protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-binded station and the PeptidyltransferaseCenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to binding on this binding station Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal education active 50s-bosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the local prevalency of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some Infection forms may appear, a advice by experts should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in in-vitro activity compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin salbe was placed daily under occlusion on intact and unflowed skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days to the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out in 3 or 4 of the adult patients each time prior to mediation and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual system intake on humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes has been primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro check on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in the human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats-microcore test to in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither in male nor female rats signs of restricted fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has reached an increase of up to 5 times higher exposure when the highest estimated exposure when people (topical application on 200 cm2 were lower):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (in accordance with the estimated 3-fold of the estimated human exposure (see above), development response (reduced bodyweight of the fetus and retinal toxicity) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of approval for the application must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system is present, as described in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of approval for the office is obligated to perform detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of authorisation, and all additional updates by the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for certain products for Human Use," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms of the treated place are supposed to end the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other salts, creams, or lotions on the surface to be treated with Altargo if it was not explicitly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in your eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment will be seen on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor to advice, if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After carrying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with sterilised bandage or a Gazeverband, unless your doctor has advised you to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in a aluminum tube with a plastic seal, containing 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in a aluminum bag that contains 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases which affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of one of two doses existing vaccines, where protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used when immune to immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection, and it is ensured that the vaccine can be led to an end in two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is requested for Hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have effect in destroying the immune system (the natural defense of the body), "how it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the virus and the surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the vaccine Twinrix Adults since 1996 and has been the approved Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protect the same illnesses, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered in one out of three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are contained identical substances, some of the data supported by the application of Twinrix adults, are also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indian for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, who developed a protective antibody after the last injection a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led a month after the final injection of hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated one month after the last injection of the development of hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambience was similar with a sixth and 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side-side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, mats (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambience may not be applied to patients who are potentially sensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. a permit for placing the Ambirix in the entire world</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the primrix is made up of two vaccines, with the first dose to be given at the date of choice and the second dose of six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a riser chimed both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HbsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same size order as according to the vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not fully assured whether immunity-proficient persons who require an hepatitis B vaccine, which require altimeter as a protection since they are also protected by immunological memory due to immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccine, for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction, following the gift of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quicker protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hematalysis patients and persons with immune system disorders, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody is achieved so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because an intraoral injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an suboptimal impetus which should be avoided, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with thrombocytopenie or blood coagulation disorders, Ambirix may be injected subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If ambience was administered in the form of a separate injections at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetinus-, azellular Pertuss-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- mumps vaccine was the immune response to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or patients suffering from immune defects have to be assumed that potentially no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which has been carried out with 3 vaccines in this formulation, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matoria, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in previous Thiomerang and preservative added vaccine formulating.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccination outlets were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years the tolerability of Ambirix are compared with the 3-cans-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mats on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the Ambience of Ambirix in 50,7% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 doses of combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle reported 66.4% of subjects had been given to the ambience over pain, over 63.8% had been vaccinated with the 3-tin combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of matoria, however, was comparable high (i.e. about the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received ambience compared with 36.2% compared to the subjects who received 3 doses of combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of distinctive pain and matoria was low and comparable to that, after administration of the combination vaccine, it was observed with the 3-doses vaccine vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- 11-year-old vaccination, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable with the 3-cans-combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, with the 6- to 11- year old, however, after vaccination with ambirix a number of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines which reported about severe adverse events during the 2-doses vaccination with 360 ELISA- units formalininactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface treatments reported was not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials involving vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years were the serotonin-conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6-passed dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, for month 6-passed dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15 years old, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were obtained the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogeneity was impacted, the serum rates (SP in table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with its ambience.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, these vaccinations were either a 2-doses vaccine with its ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs were detected at least 24 months after immunisation with ambience in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction against both antigens was comparable to the vaccine that was diagnosed with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitisan A-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface in a dose of 0,5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-old showed that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies are comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the altimeter of a combined diphtherie-, inactivated poliomyelitis (DTPA-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps of vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seropoconversion rates as for former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both before and after the reset, to investigate any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be caused by itching skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prevalent administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">For a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second inoculation, the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambiance.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced level of effective investigation (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated Hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content to effective measures will typically be given a month after the first dose and is likely to give your child a vaccination protection against the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2789">Ambience can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient, so that a blood test can be necessary to see how strongly the response is to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Sort your doctor if you are taking another drug / taking part (including those who have been vaccinated without prescription) or if you have been vaccinated / has been given or immunoglobulins (antibodies) or that is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient for the vaccine and therefore the person is not opposed to one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and possible such limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix are given at the same time or just before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles available.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since issuance of the first approval for the inverter, the CHMP ceases that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix has been released only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug may be limited to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia may also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hypertext (brain damage caused by high ammoniac concentrations) in history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is divided - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed with the food or via a Gastrostomieschi (through the abdominal wall) or a nose probe (through the nose in the stomach-leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonschnapps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo medication, i.e. without the active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonsis may also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, liquetion, taste disorders, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash or uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humanitarian Selector (CHMP) concluded that Ammonschnapps in patients were effective in patients with the urea resolution of high ammonials.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonsis was approved under "extraordinary circumstances, because due to the rare disease of the condition at the time of approval only limited information to this drug.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 living days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifold form (incomplete enzyme defective, which manifest itself after the first life of life) there is then an indication for the use when in the history of a hypertext of encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manium lack of carbylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranty bamylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as a risk for the emergence of oil sophagusulcera, if the tablets do not immediately arrive in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which is the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied for patients with concompressive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with sodium retention and odomination of clinical conditions with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">The subcutaneous formulation of phenylacetic to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neurons and to a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be found whether phenylacetate is eliminated in human breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the breastfeeding period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">An probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactating acid, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of excess dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) was a case of an excessive dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed intravenous neurotoxicity with intravenous administration of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetic is a metabolic active link formed by acetamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is eliminated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Inhichiometrically is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disruptions of the urea cycle may be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate may be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and early, and treatment is immediately started to improve survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The forecast of the early manifical form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infested, and the disease led to treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickless analogy within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrous oxide (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium polyphenylacetic), proteins reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase survival rate of newborn patients in postpartal (however within the first month of life).</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease had been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were already treated before the first appearance of hypertext, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with many intellectual disability or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manious form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygous form of ornithintranzyylase deficiency), which recovered from a hypertext of encephalopathy, and after that were treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys enzymatic, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined according to an individual dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in empty healthy adults and with liver cirrhosis after single return and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolism was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous gift of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetic.</seg>
<seg id="2845">According to an oral dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma cutting by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclical disorders or hemoglobbopathies, after different doses phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) was detectable in plasma in the next morning after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis that repeated having been treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the medium phenylacetate concentration in the plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Deposition The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of conjugated production Phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate showed no klastogenic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either by oral (infants and children who can't swallow any tablets) or were given a gastrostomy or a nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manium lack of carbylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranty bamylase, the substitution of Citrullin or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram sodium polyphenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat failed before the birth of phenylacetic (active metaboite of phenylbutyrate), it came to lesions in the pyramids of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">An probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactating acid, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Meschiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on examinations concerning the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disruptions of the urea cycle may be assumed that for each gram, polyphenylbutyrate may be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">According to an oral dose of 5 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate in granular form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma cutting by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product only for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this purpose the small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium polyphenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient must receive the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare cases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot reverse the stickled waste products, depending on the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If at your laboratory studies, you have to inform the doctor that you may have AMMONAPS, since sodium polyphenylbutyrate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other drugs, please inform your doctor or pharmacists if you are taking other medicines or have taken recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the breastfeeding, you cannot take AMMONAPS, because the medicine could pass through the breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, disorientations, memory disorders, and deterioration of existing neurologic states were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, you immediately put your doctor or with the listing of your hospital to receive a corresponding treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example, unstable Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different starch) or myocardial infarction (an abnormal measurement value at the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients that undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered, and the infusion may be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with anxiety or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS at which the effect of angiox in sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While the PCI was often used a stent (a short tube, which remains in the arteries to prevent a clasp), and they received other medicines for preventing blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">For the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">Patients who undergo a PCI was equally effective in relation to all indicators as Heparin, except with severe bleeding, where it was clearly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against bivalentudin, other miludines or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It cannot be applied to patients who have recently had a blood pressure, as well as in people with heavy high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is at the treatment of ACS and while a PCI is a acceptable replacement for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted The Medicines Company UK Ltd submitted an approval for the placing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina / non - ST-Hebdo infarction (IA / NSTEMI) in case of an emergency, or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0,25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is performed in another row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">Based on clinical requirements, the reduced incidence of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the encroachment.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage for angiox in patients with a PCI is of an initial intravenous bolt of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a sole Boletus of angiox was not examined and is not recommended, even if a quick PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to below 225 seconds, a second bolt securing is 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to decrease the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceuticals before use should be mixed and administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another surveillance is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with severe kidney problems (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that are subjected to a PCI (if treated with bivalentudine vs. ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0,3 mg / kg is sufficient to date and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with severe kidney damage caused by the III- PCI Express study (REPLACE-2), which led to the approval, the ACT was 5 minutes following the gift of the Bivalentudin-Bolus without Dosiscustomization on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also with dialysis of patients is angiox contraindicated (see below 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalentudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though using PCI patients under Bivalentudin most bleeding problems arise on arterial punctuation, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during treatment in principle.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bivalerudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International normative ratio) should be taken in order to ensure that the value of the treatment with bivalentudin is once again achieved prior to the treatment level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge on the action mechanism of anticoagulemancipes (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or throbocytic aggregationshemmer) may be assumed that these active ingredients may increase blood risk.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin combination with Thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulemancipes are the clinical and biological hemostatic parameters in any case regularly check.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments are insufficient in terms of impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, incorporate or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalentudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalentudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either infractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalentudin group as well as in heparine-treated comparisons, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than with male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding were defined according to the ACUITY and Timi measures for heavy bleeding, as defined in Table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleedings stood under Bivalerudin alone significantly less than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy blood pressure was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular blood concentration of ≥ 4 g / dl with a well-known blood control station, reduction of hemoglobin spiration of ≥ 3 g / dl. with known blood control, reoperation due to a blood flow, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred at more than 0,1% (occasionally), were "other" points of points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side-side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with biopsy in 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalentudin group as well as in heparine treated comparisons, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more likely to adverse events than with male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleedings come significantly less than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above were classified according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs listed in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of an overdose the treatment with Bivalirudin immediately break off and to monitor the patient engmeshy with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalentudin, a direct and specific Thrombinator, which binds both on the catalytic centre as well as on the Anionenbindindrical region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalentudin in Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible because thrommbin sails gradually spread the binding of bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4, thereby regenerates the function of the active centre of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by bivalent patients with serum from patients, in which the Throarininduced Thrombocytopenie / heparininduced Thrombosis Syndrome (HIT / HITTS) was induced, no Thrombocyte aggregate reaction is induced.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalentudin shows a dosing and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is proved by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In case of the patient, an PCI was carried out below, an additional Boletus was given from 0.5mg / kg Bivalentudin and infusion for the duration of the intervention at 1.75mg / kg / h should be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfraction heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST midmarket attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor before the beginning of the angiography (at the time of the edge) or at the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high risk products required a angiography required within 72 hours, spread evenly over the 3 arms.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children aged six years with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) to the abdominal wall, the upper thighs, or the upper arm injected with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose pipegs (sugar) in the blood, or cannot handle insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly of human insulin, and the change means it is faster and a shorter period of work has a short-term human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin. in two studies, with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes where the body insulin does not work effective, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indian for its effectiveness was the change of the concentration of the substance glykosylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or any of the remaining components, or patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH to bring an approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thighs or doltamuskels or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the field of abdominal pain.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced glucose capacity and the diminished insulin metabolism, insulin demand in patients with a limitation of liver function may be lowered.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin delivery (normal, NPH, zinc delays etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can move into a change of insulin needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dose or breakdown of treatment, particularly in patients with a insulin intake, can lead to a hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient on another insulin type or an insulin delivery of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and can be necessary a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin delivery and can therefore change during transformation of the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances which can increase blood glucose levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia, include oral antidiabetic, fiber-in-converting enzyme, fibrate, fluoroxetine, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphs, saliylic ate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, among the effects of sympatholytics such as bed lockup, Clonidine, Guanethidin and Reserve pin the symptoms of adrenergen are weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experiments on reproductive macular studies showed no differences between intra- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulls occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not occur neither in mother's milk, nor is absorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Below are the findings of the adverse effects listed in clinical trials (exceeding common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on basis of the available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual excitement or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea, and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will fails to change the injection site within the injection process, can appear in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with consciousness can be given by a intramuscultic or subcutaneous injection of glucoagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by an appropriated person or treated by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose jection, the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially due to skeletal musculature and fat) as well as through the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous Ga- be carried out in effect and the mode of mode is shorter than in huu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melon, insulin resistance showed up to a dose of proportionate glucose effect of 0.075 to 0.15 e / kg, a proportional increase in glucose effects, precisely as human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete draught effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data, it was clearly shown that when an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable hieroglycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which will be 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insullulisin 2 minutes before the meal was taken, a better post-denial control was given than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin delivery is administered in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a similar glycemic control such as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 mixes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin delivery in every 2 minutes (GLULISIN: before) before the meal was given at the beginning of the meal, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN: afterward) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
