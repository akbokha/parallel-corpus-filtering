the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative to the various icons and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it to depic@@ t file hier@@ archi@@ es with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is propor@@ tionally to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of sub@@ or@@ derly objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the size of the size of the entries is specified . therefore , large files can be easily detected , if they can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy ; therefore , it can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX Â® command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation of a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of useful color display and labelling settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle which is switched on display color mode , can display either depth for the easy recognition of wearing dis@@ counting or the figure of another file association such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various features of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can specify if there is enough space for display , or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ esses are present , or if the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ates should be used ( whereby consequently , the description of sub@@ ordin@@ ate may occur in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can design@@ ate the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
in case of performances for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be held propor@@ tionally , that the surface is propor@@ tionally kept . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be kept . in order to complete the scre@@ ech@@ ing of the entries , and this frame is not always available . note that less space is lost for frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square .
as the layout of the area is done for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left up . here , it is necessary for labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses incur@@ ably , that rec@@ tan@@ gles that are square . the best methods of this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minimal surface for one entry over the menu entry . instead , an R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an under@@ ordered entry .

modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera also appears as a disk drive system . the connection can also be realized via the Picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports communication with digital kam@@ er@@ as@@ . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , continuous software collection for digital cameras , which is an increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows to transfer images of digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . as photos generally are large files and transmission over the serial port , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ p@@ added , supports the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , which can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to move anything or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers is how easy its functionality can be expanded through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; , Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view is available . the aim is to provide the modules for the K@@ IP@@ I modules in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually every way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; by writing a small module to complement one function , when the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; even perform .

&amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technology , the hair algorithm . this enables pictures to compare these signatures . the lower the difference between two images , the more they meet . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is a range in which you can fall on each image to find a similar picture . if you can insert a picture from somewhere over the symbol of un@@ rav@@ ishing search in the left side bar , then this will open and you can fall there .
sk@@ etch : freedom and color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ tization ; the appropriate pictures can be added here .

&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a light table in a separate window available with which you can compare images . he works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To the lumin@@ aire displayed from the context menu . when you &apos;re back in &amp; digi@@ plug , the main window is open , you can open the lumin@@ ous quickly with L ex@@ tras .
from the Pre@@ ferences bar , you can compare the images that you compare to see in the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates that copy of the tool@@ bar , select and shoot at one of the images , then those in the other picture will also be executed . so , you can compare the same area of both pictures .
another mode is better suited to import quickly from a photo series . if you use Paar@@ l navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will automatically display on the same pattern to display it in the left side . it will be shown in the right @-@ right picture shown in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures .
of course the normal soldering actions operate directly from the fluorescent , e.g. F4 file editing ....
all images from the right side bar of the main engine are available for both display pictures in the light table . for example , it makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each range , you will find a built @-@ in turn@@ table function which you &apos;ll find on the crossed section of the image . to hold the visible area of the image , you need to hold them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; both pictures will be shown in the same image .
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse spro@@ cket to zoom in and out . this happens in both images if you are in mode ahead .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers each part of the process that has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent collection . each of the photos stored , sc@@ anned or digital photos will perform a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures , find , protect , protect and use photos . here we will focus on downloading , ren@@ ame , evaluate , order , sti@@ ff , archive , optimize , waiting , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital surveys takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , search , transformed , transformed , packaged and exported contents representing a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data , provide information about or documentation of other data , which are administr@@ ated by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer . if you don &apos;t even need to know how many photos you have , then you &apos;ll probably don &apos;t want to save &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze at a database as well as in the image files , very fast searching and secure archi@@ ving that you can access to other programs , platforms , and formats .
the first thing you do and know before you have to keep your system stored in your system . you have to decide whether other access to your photos should have to store if you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location . if you have enough photos , then you &apos;ll be able to organize your file as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stac@@ king processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fy a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the list of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget it then you can then save the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? in addition , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; to provide a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , as you should now select any photograph , sign@@ alling and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos .
let &apos;s start with keyword , keyword , as you are often called on other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source containing embedded keyword , then digi@@ tization will automatically add the tree to the right place . converting the hier@@ archy within the tree is no problem and can easily be replaced by removing a sub@@ tree to another . the changed sample are taken from &amp; digi@@ p@@ olls ; last updated while the sub@@ trees are pursued .
the graphic shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata is in truth out of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keyword - the next section refers to cra@@ ft@@ ings or comments using the third important tool to cataly@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata .
most of them don &apos;t want to let anybody know your photos , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how to arrive at your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer look at some details , people , the place .
and now I say you this the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period is again present , you may perhaps even hear the silence . so the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself . if you show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning to the viewer , to help him help you understand what you are moving about what you understand .
it &apos;s al@@ right if a picture is not perfect , if it &apos;s the strength only with a lab@@ eling for itself to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can save a lot of text in an international alp@@ habet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) as a lab@@ eling . if you want to export it to a selection of pictures simultaneously . if you export your images into web galleries and / or the title of web @-@ gallery system , you &apos;ll have to tell the story for opening a second time .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet on Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train from the spatial presentation is now already with light speed .
the possibilities for ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that you can open your journeys through pictures with geographical data . you can also export the pictures at reception . however , you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc . with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a p@@ un with copyright and design@@ ate the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions about the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all @-@ changed versions , i.e. for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information came in on &amp; digi@@ tization page ; as information is required :
author ( syn@@ onym for manufacturers and authors ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired , the name of a company or organisation can be used . after which this value was saved , it should not be changed anymore . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onymous with the author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples include : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a comment on the author &apos;s box , this must be filled in this case .
editor ( syn@@ onym for vend@@ ors ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ feld to identify who this photo offers . if the photographer wants to offer a news agency as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a store photo , then the image / agency will be listed here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not have any protection against abuse . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer is able to delete or modify . the solution for this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in the picture . &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; is available in the near future a module for the stac@@ king processing .

of course , we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data production company in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must not need to be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ v@@ quality . of course , you can claim even more expensive and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . whether you believe it is in your si@@ gh play@@ room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can reduce good dis@@ cos and good recording speeds , and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . it is therefore the correct one to choose .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors , even if you just wrote only . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ att@@ ing and control of control . despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there &apos;s a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it &apos;s still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to save the For@@ mat@@ krieg against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ quality media . also , please check the media with a description , date &amp; author identification and afterwards protected by a clean , dark dry and before animals protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ or@@ aries retain your statistics for themselves . its manufacturer features include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard disks : dis@@ sem@@ inal Study
shortly : dis@@ cos the longest if you are operated at the temperature range of 35 Â° C to 45 Â° C. The most common error of error , SM@@ ART cannot determine the error . some of the SM@@ ART confirmed this error . these are especially readers of readers . the expected lifetime of life expect@@ ancy amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a current account before you have secured the files , but these losses normally have to produce without great problems .
while most electrical devices are not much , this can take advantage of devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware age , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current tips is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absor@@ bing a part of the energy heat and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a slot bar . remember that not every plug bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for a over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it protects you protection against ligh@@ tening , and protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers are also applicable to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and television .
if you have a notebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for travelling .
while a over@@ voltage protection system protects your system against minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you . even an issue of a few seconds can result in loss of irre@@ plac@@ able data . it may therefore be useful to invest in un@@ inter@@ rup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ voltage devices , these devices can automatically adjust the battery power . however , some models allow them to store and keep the system ordered . if you buy a US@@ V , you should be sure that they might be able to keep the same quality requirements such as a over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the surrounding software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare and compare its safety in blackout to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection may cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you think you are using it . at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the correct configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities of data .
you are compared to the hard drives home but very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data on compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable for a solution to local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB . the professional version provides you more , in the case of Flick@@ r more dramatically . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked out in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very safe . data transfer errors are automatically cleaned up to the TCP protocol and contain a secure memory . therefore , they are des@@ aster safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calcul@@ ator . all transfers are pr@@ one to transfer errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs are at least certain data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you do not have any protection to your machine . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than in your computer .
un@@ reliable networks are a further source of trans@@ lu@@ c@@ ting , as they generate inter@@ rup@@ tions within the data flow . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transfers , you should see in the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors each year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and scal@@ able with record defects . it is open source , with many patents and is available under an GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms by using and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses in the notebook and 46 % for workplace systems . Not@@ ebooks , for not@@ ebooks , is already the proportion of theft of 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people . it is currently limited to a lower damage , such as theft steels or new@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; none of them have been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . please find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ational inter@@ ruption occurs during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the largest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic of all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result is rather deterior@@ ating . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras required your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel cameras . for higher resolutions , you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB HDD is currently available for 100 &amp; euro ; so you don &apos;t make any other users responsible for data loss . so , you can save your data frequently after a plan , and test this f@@ use before you do something dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected during the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot . forget plane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , des@@ aster fle@@ xion means a non @-@ local storage . bring your attention up the stairs into the neighbouring house , into your office or the like .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as already mentioned above is a frequent reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files is supposed to be secured . it is a moment of moments without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential : a backup of the files have been changed since last complete recovery . generates complete moments of time on two periods : the end @-@ to @-@ end security and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : backup the files that have been changed since last backup . you can restore the original status to any time . this f@@ use comes to a ver@@ sion@@ ing system on the next with the exception which is only ab@@ orted and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only the difference of files the really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore life . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the working files . at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moments for each month . any further cut@@ outs should be done manually , after which you have done a complete review .
topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associ@@ ating X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copying the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
because the future is un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable because of its nature , you need to consider and re@@ assess the time with caution . unfortunately , there is no other way to be backward . every 5 @-@ 8 years should you ask yourself as the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system , then it is important to read and install it in a virtual machine for a later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and f@@ use technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . actually , it always means to increase .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability to plan and set the range you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and add it to a new record :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command whether your new record was recognized by the system , but do not hang them .

open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create this yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should therefore not use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard for the GIF . it may be los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and a slow compression is required . this format we want to save you for saving your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression sal@@ ine ( default ) . however , a problem is , however , that this format has been adapted from many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital negative file format is a licensed free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is required to use met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer asks D@@ NG already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information are allowed to include the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the rough format , as it stores the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . however , it can be noted to problems with link between met@@ ad@@ ata file and the image file , and so you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , supporting a large area of application purposes and business models . among the activities of D@@ C@@ MI activities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve a further acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera service are , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert Roh@@ files to D@@ NG and save them in your rough archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for fine processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ plug , then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut down under any circumstances of the other programs .
protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them to Web@@ gal@@ eries , add in m@@ peg , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ p@@ . in the section adding a photos to a record , you can add a description as you can already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , use this with the calcul@@ ator , turn the camera on display mode , and turn it another . a further description is found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it may take a while to connect with your camera . if the connection is produced , a he@@ x indicator will display a while . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on each entry . with the side@@ bars features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the features of a details or met@@ ad@@ ata .
this dialogue shows file properties and the photo information to be stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras , you can &apos;t find all information available .
the met@@ ad@@ ata met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS , etc. of the picture . these information are the same as at met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available on some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then select the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug . in downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were sure to be released in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the selected editor of &amp; K@@ DE . once you have selected the photos , you can download the button downloaded and then selected . the button chosen can be selected as long as you chose some photos .
if your camera supports this is an option available to download . these pictures have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new pictures have been selected with a star in the window window . if you choose this option , you will only download the new pictures .
if you can download the buttons All download or selected files , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , displayed as normal folder , displayed in the section of My Albums . select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; downloads the photographs from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the required photos , you can delete it from the camera . if you want to delete all the button , you must first select this first and delete the delete chosen .
please note that there are no possibility that you have deleted from the camera . so the photos will not be deleted in the tr@@ ash of &amp; K@@ DE ; so you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted by the camera . if you want to delete the camera image , you should make this much faster than that .
cameras use as a fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names will normally be upgraded once again after the photos taken from the camera . therefore , it may be useful , the date and time , in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and date @-@ based sub@@ sid@@ y . if you use this last option , a folder will be created per day .
the options While the transmission opens three more options to be performed before the photos stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields are copied . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % - % d % H : % M : % S . switch the option date &amp; time . for more custom@@ ization , you should read the command &apos;s help .
if you use the camera file name , you have the ability to change the file names in lower@@ case , or if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ plug , is displayed below the name , displayed below the name , displayed the camera in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the next time .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the heart . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is switched on , and if your camera does not deliver these information , lets &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; the photo in the original orientation , use the kno@@ b and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera has been made available on the date of which the photo was made available , can be downloaded &amp; digi@@ plug into the image data . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ title . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ title . not all cameras are available to read what information your camera could be embedded in the photographs .
this option is usually off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; the photos are directly on the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button Advanced and select the option file @-@ based bottom line at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from her host to your camera is the button Download . select the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug where images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant that can be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude . the identification of data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photography , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphic an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you forgot later , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tization ; users want to locate the location of the photos , or simply use this aspect , it &apos;s good to en@@ rich the position data of a photos .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map refer@@ r@@ als . it is at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via editing the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is no camera that has a GPS unit integrated . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module to ge@@ ographic assignment .
there are various programs for Windows and Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and extract from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ established coordinates required by map@@ s.@@ google .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , all show details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; try to give you so much control over his working processes as possible . there are many settings that come into the Settings menu . to set up this settings , you must set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .

this page contains , as below , shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data will automatically be selected to the corresponding IP@@ TC data protection . in case of database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the editor : this field should be the profession of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a further description of a car field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not need to be the author , if this is a news agency , such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations will be listed here , then the group or agency that the image should be shown here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ der@@ s. by this way the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; these met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ des ; imported without being lost .
image marking as embedded fittings ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG image : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images embedded in the images . attention : in pictures that already contain signs , these are over@@ written by the digi@@ tization .
the page settings include all the options for the information that appear if the mouse pointing at the main window about one file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tization ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; digi@@ plug , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove any file extensions , who doesn &apos;t have any of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; ignored .
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on your right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ escent material of &amp; digi@@ tised ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can obtain a better understanding .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bars if you use the image processing in full@@ screen mode .
over@@ - and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this clear@@ er mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched off and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are coded in higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the specific explanation .
using P@@ NG files you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG requires a low @-@ loss algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 means a high compression .
when the T@@ IF@@ F files com@@ press com@@ press the default setting of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it has no influence on image quality , since the default algorithm is los@@ s@@ less .
with the loss of low @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can easily store loss . even if you have the loss of loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was still not supported , but found in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs . currently , it is very quickly developed to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default pattern is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this difference is a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option records the picture a bit soft , elim@@ in@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white turn of the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white is not set . standard is it a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . by using the second sensors , the effect that under@@ ette images get more details in the Spitz@@ lich@@ ens . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the hair@@ y , so the parts of your images are to catch the hair@@ y white in the settings when the in@@ ability of your camera demonstrates the setting of the setting . finally , you can try to recon@@ figure out some of the missing information in various ros@@ at@@ balls . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ utter .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not vary as quickly as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to recon@@ struct the missing green and red @-@ parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ design , you get the possibility to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted to each image individually .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . however , you &apos;ll probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing can be made small , you should be conservative .
a demo process algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particle data sensor , which have many cameras and the Matrix colorful pixels are available . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ structure .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; and D@@ cra@@ w are available to you three alternatives : Bil@@ in@@ ear , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ o@@ genetic interfaces ) , the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . Bil@@ in@@ ear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color variation of your lenses you can set the red and blue o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a different color correction , as you will be performed during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this should be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; information such as the color formations of a color space in the other , so that the colors are as closely as possible .
behavior asking questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
colour profile file set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you all store your profiles . &amp; digi@@ p@@ added , these folders will be examined during the launch .
settings of ICC Pro@@ files you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the rough file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures colored not the whole screen .
the input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you use . not all profiles are created on the same type . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain any colour mapping or G@@ amm@@ ak@@ or@@ atory . this means that you do not have to perform the colour mapping itself .
there are other options like the soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate the picture of a device again . this is very useful before you can print the picture , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors . this could be correct , instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is designed for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially :
the Canon pro@@ pane extension lets the style realize : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewing and image processing is supported . many modules have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select which you want to use , and these modules will then be downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug . these modules appear as new entries in the main menu and in addition , you will find some of the menu in the context menu .
short commands for tasks , which are performed by modules , can set in the menu under Settings short commands .
for more information ( in English ) over K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ti@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the se@@ ash@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other cross fields turn the met@@ ad@@ ata or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during display .
the camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is connected to identify the camera . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode . there are now serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage that you have to be attached to your camera here .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , you must connect the camera to your computer , put it in display mode and turn on .
try out whether &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . once you have installed your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main menu cameras from the main menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash@@ ine , you can adjust the discussion of &amp; digi@@ plug . when clearing a photos in an album , you &apos;ll find further details in the cut @-@ sections of a photos and delete a record .
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ kled by &amp; digi@@ plug , if you use the option to use changes in the right side@@ bar without feedback . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also see the display of the welcome image of &amp; digi@@ plug ; at boot time . this acceler@@ ates the start of &amp; digi@@ tization under circumstances .
the setting is looking for new photos and digi@@ tization ; the base file after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ p@@ added . if something from the base file was deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ p@@ added , whether it should be removed from the database .
various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ plug , select the main window to adapt to your taste . these settings can choose among settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers , please find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . the image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse menu to preview the preview menu and selection of details / editing .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug . so , you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can set up in the section image processing .
a status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size shows .
a menu bar on the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions .
editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , if you don &apos;t want to change the original photo before you save file , or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have stored the picture .
so , maybe you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save you with file saving .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by repe@@ ating the image processing or the kno@@ b button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since last Save .
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed and re@@ produced . the last action can be revers@@ ed , by editing editing , or re @-@ manufactured using the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the key@@ note abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for recovery and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; for a moment longer , press a context menu in the tool@@ bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have launched the image processing , you can use between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu . if you have made changes on the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back up .
you can in the photo in and get out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse &apos;s bike or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full screen , the photo is displayed in full screen mode . if you do not want to use the tool bar . if you do not want to change the tool bar . if you do not want this , you can call this out of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window . see the section to setup image processing .
if you want to print the current image , select a picture in the image menu and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the Main Menu you can print individual images or entire phr@@ ases . you only have to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album , you &apos;ll only need to follow the assistant , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected pictures . the same page bar is available without the navigation system , even in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders is cli@@ cked on :
multi@@ f@@ lap clicking on the same rider will disappear or disappear in the edges .
in the labelling view you can input signals with unlimited size or insert . the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and are designed to use special characters . if you want to use IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you comments , use either the button Apply or change to the next image , the labelling will then be saved .
besides the user button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , this is always done when you select a met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written in the pictures .
this section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . in order to evaluate more images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the assessment is written into the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword shows a search box to filtering the keywords , the sample @-@ tree , and a select box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ plug ; session @-@ related keyword .
the sample @-@ tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the selected search phrase . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering the sample in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , they are stored for fast access .
passwords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the respective local cross@@ ings in the tree . all aspects of a picture are stored into the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want to select a selection with keyword , please read the section keyword filter .
the page bar keyword is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search results . if additionally one or more sample filter from the right side will be used , only the inter@@ section of these two are displayed . all displayed keywords are available .
you can also drag and remove them . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the keyword already exists , you can easily move from the right side bar and place on the selection . then a dialogue , which you asks , whether you want to set the keyword .
in the top example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword is based on no keyword , which has been selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a keyword from the right sample tree was drawn to the selection and placed there . a dialogue asks whether this keyword is supposed to be set .
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . you can also be accessed below settings .
if you have a rule with and created and determine that it &apos;s a or must be , you can easily change this easily with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after the database is searched . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string which is already placed in the database .
for example , you can define an extends search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the check@@ box at the end of the rule , and after the kno@@ b group . the options look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flick@@ r not listed ? the free space site is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store images in full resolution there .
this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I was primarily adapted to &amp; digi@@ tised ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you set a color @-@ administered workflow , which can actually be photographed by your camera or scanners . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can get that the colors on your monitor uses the same color or scanner , and the colors that you print or publish the colors of your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic of color management comes , everyone would like to know what buttons it must press for the results he wants . unfortunately the sense of this tut@@ orials is to provide sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions make you get the desired result .
if your image sequence meets all six criteria listed below , you must not take care of the color scheme .
you work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( see further information below )
your only other picture spending are by e @-@ mail or the web , where the RGB of the de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for all so easy , why should one use another colour space and do so with so thoughts about colour controls ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that can see , the hu@@ gs @-@ shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colors , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms , and then click on info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I have to handle my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to monitor your monitor via s@@ RGB . if you are working as a RGB of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool produces five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . so , use it before you try to try further manual processing .
the norm@@ alize , un@@ equal , automati@@ cal and contrast is extending from the menu , auto @-@ correction try to automatically make your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the volume exceeding the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color sha@@ ding . this feature often is a magical correction for pictures the dark or balanced .
un@@ equ@@ alled : this method is adjusted the intensity of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity of the image is as flat . sometimes it also produces very good results in improving the contrast of the image , sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation which causes either wonder in a picture or destroys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright mar@@ gins and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast to the contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of a picture by the lowest and highest values on the largest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ us@@ ade of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be good correction for bad pictures .
the wh@@ iten@@ ess of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry the white ab@@ etting of a photos .
the white @-@ equal correction is slightly restricted to a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can operate too far from the original picture , if you can operate the white directly in rough mode , which will improve your possibilities for correction better .
this tool is based on a white equ@@ hy@@ s@@ ine of the copyright law of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . it is launching the menu entry colors white to the image processing .
the window window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original picture as well as the preview of the objective is adapted . if you want to see the original whi@@ tish , then it is enough to click on the window window .
the preview of the target photographs features a red mark@@ ers . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this mar@@ ker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right there is a hist@@ ogram shown that dynamic is modified as soon as you change one parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow of alignment makes you improve or download the shadow end@@ details of your photos .
to play the above controls above , you should use the colour temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the image preview for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
additionally , you can set the white directly with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator indicator increases the colors , if more than a colour channel of pixel over@@ exposed . this will be displayed as a pure indicator as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons saving as and loading exactly this . any attitude of the white balance you have set you can store in a text file and then load again later .
the button settings will return all the filter values again to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white comparison . note that even neutral settings are given another photo than your original . if you save them , your original picture will be changed .
you can set up the code depth per color channel per color channel . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suitable for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding requires more record space , computing time and only stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG .
this tool will open the same dialogue as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color pro@@ fil@@ s . color ton@@ ic can be carried out through the under@@ window for the use of color profiles , you can draw the chapter color management .
another important tool is available in the menu of colors of Ton@@ wert@@ correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for the Ton@@ wert@@ correction , you will find further information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Far@@ be@@ et Effects provide four colour effects , a solar thermal effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a barrier filter .
in times of chemical workmanship , it was also called Solar@@ isation , as well as Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created in partially developed under a short ligh@@ tening . this result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chemical is possible . another increase is finally created , a negative image that does not generate on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar thermal system . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that processes ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he makes a stronger contra@@ ction effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easily , he emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a full colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some pictures , especially those who weigh hard scenery , too much .
the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on counter@@ parts . parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the firing re@@ petitions . in great pictures the filter can compens@@ ate the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ance of the photos in the menu . once you &apos;re satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can reduce the reverse problem . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation . all changes you can do in preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ intensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool cl@@ er@@ correction for improving exposure . even if dialogue with this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ der . specifically the three shooting below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains one graph@@ s of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ps into the inside and the left side can change to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn operation is to shift the regulator and make sure the picture changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview of the image is dynamic , updated by the image settings . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of digital camera , linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic income is useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for bright sounds and the lowest for medium sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input of the shadow , medium and bright sounds automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
exit status : the output value allows the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values , e.g. , to create output values , e.g. , to create an external image as background , while something else is fore@@ seen in the fore@@ ground .
automatically : this button will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the image values of the image .
store and store : stored in the fil@@ esystem , stored in the file system and later re@@ loaded , the Gimp level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will automatically be adjusted for all shadows , resources and sun oils . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original figure for Red , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ ant channels .
the option Ex@@ ask@@ et Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect shown only in preview , and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see an example for the alignment of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target picture shows . the preview of view is updated dynam@@ ically , depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side the following options are available :
Modification channel : this select box allows to specify the channel , which is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are located between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . mostly linear mode is the linear mode . for pictures featuring large areas of constant colour , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a new vent@@ ri@@ cular to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are related to dar@@ ker outlet , which are dar@@ ker to the related image pixel .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marking is shown . if you want to shift this marking on the curve , a matching line is displayed on the curve , which is the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and off , until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and store : you can do this with these buttons . every curve that you can create is stored in the file system and later loaded , the file format is Gimp &apos;s format .
if you create this method and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the controls of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blu@@ e- and lumin@@ escent curve .
the option Ex@@ tended Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect shown only in preview , and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white picture that was corrected by the L@@ umin@@ aire channel . shadow and Sonn@@ ent@@ Ã¶@@ ne was used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; image processing is a tool to improve the can@@ als or to change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color @-@ Mixer &apos; menu .
you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target picture features a red mark@@ ers . if you position this in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to indicate the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction , it will enable you to adjust the image of the color . if you can also activate the corresponding color components , as the channel mixer , then DAS tool to produce great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color comes from a visible space that comes from far@@ brau@@ schen . colour@@ less consists of small smo@@ k@@ art@@ ef@@ acts that appear differently in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour@@ less first .
the saving as and store buttons are just used for this purpose . any Mixer &apos;s adjustment can be saved for later and then download . the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer .
the option Ex@@ ask@@ et Indi@@ c@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect shown only in preview , and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography always was fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step , because color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of movie roll@@ ers .

green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks great , at all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
Oran@@ tes : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a orange lin@@ den filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ tes .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate Moon@@ light from time to time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) red filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : generates warm and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the shadow . this is very similar to the trial of a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures on one image .
adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look like a oil painting , a pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry image texture is used for this image processing .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and that modified ( 2 ) . parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mould frames can be added a decorative framework to be added a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task . to keep its attention , it is a psychological barrier for the setting eye . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame , the module can be launched from the image processing .
type : with this parameter , put the image type with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounding it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button@@ ing effect and decor@@ atively add an ornam@@ ental frame with pattern .
width : the width of the frame is in percent . the range of value for width is 1 % to 50 % .
this with a separate target image will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you use the tool to cut the aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple text @-@ form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also applies to more places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . use text @-@ replacement , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features like you need . the larger the picture , the larger the character set should be . finally , select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button &quot; OK &quot; after the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool sten@@ cil , you can create a template over one image .
the menu image template : apply in image processing can be used to put templates about a picture .
for the template , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum com@@ pressing ( 9 ) to remove the file size of the template . please send an email in english to the &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ p@@ c@@ vs @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you will need to put your template folder with the kno@@ b base folder . select the folder in which you have copied template files . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder for the sten@@ cils was reflected in a building view , which is reflected the folder structure of the template &apos;s document . selecting a folder the pre@@ ference bar of sten@@ cils will be updated automatically .
below the preview , three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to reduce the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
shift : use this button to move the image below the template . use the image and put it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . image will then be adapted automatically .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; sets three different tools available for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture of shar@@ per . actually , it &apos;s not a bit more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it is a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang .
Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ her may be the best of the three , as he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is the smaller edges a bit shy . the same phenomenon can be coded into a common colour . the same phenomenon can be easily printed when color points can be printed on paper . SLR cameras need normally more retro@@ fit sharp@@ ening as normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG image , a camera has been used in internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format must always be sharp@@ ened during processing .
some scanners are already turning a sharp@@ ness while reading the image . if you dis@@ able this turn , you will get control of your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening work@@ station . you can correct it with the menu entry .
you should use it carefully because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edges of the edges , but intensi@@ fying the noise . in general , you can easily correct use of the tool ref@@ using . in ref@@ using , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to make the picture a bit soft , is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool for plas@@ tic@@ iser , and experiment a little with settings . the window window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter unmistak@@ ably m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove mu@@ ff@@ ers from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and preview can help you edit the picture . the window window is showing the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values generate frequently good results and should be tried out first . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask too strongly , get a noise and impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of a edge through the filters . high @-@ resolution images are allowing greater radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a frac@@ ture of the maximum RGB @-@ value and the differential amount . you can therefore define a minimum difference in order for a edge of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharp@@ ening and therefore the beauty f@@ law avoided in faces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ et was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ sis re@@ focuses on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copyright protective filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to make a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ sing quot ; in which it is a better approach to sharp@@ ening the photo . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tration . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening images is the use of an un@@ sharp@@ est mask . Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze usually achieves better results than irregular m@@ ask@@ et . you can launch it from the menu by calling colors Ref@@ ok@@ us@@ ze in the image processing .
in practice , the circular construction works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ illing . the Gau@@ Ã &apos;@@ sche F@@ illing is also dependent on the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original qu@@ ell@@ low pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ illing is influenced by far from the distant pixels , causing undes@@ i@@ rable outcomes .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular shaped bottom . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should be 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is very unpleasant , but then you should pay attention to Heiligen@@ pons .
Cor@@ relation : a increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in smoking filter may help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very po@@ or@@ ly . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value is added to the picture .
Gau@@ Ã &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your shar@@ pen G@@ auss is . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 to increase annoying arti@@ facts , so you may also increase the correlation and / o@@ der@@ den noise filters .
size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , this value determines good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ Ã &apos;s edge . however , you should select large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the saving as and store buttons are used exactly for this purposes . any modification of any ref@@ us@@ sis parameters you have to be stored for later and then can be loaded .
try all the cut , color and intensity correc@@ tions before the image before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture before . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not able to appear immediately , but left un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts .
if you read pictures and read it , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , non @-@ sharp mapping produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening .
theore@@ tically it must always produce arti@@ facts always remove arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the un@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it can never be at least just as good as the un@@ sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better at processing small details .
below , you can see a comparison between different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ clear colour picture has to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to sufficient light for auto focus Lin@@ se .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the control of the system sets the un@@ sharp@@ ness of the area that was dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non @-@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented levels .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different settings as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
in case you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail : p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth glass of smooth and details . a value of 0.9 should have that no sharp@@ ening is needed , that no sharp@@ ening is necessary to be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
coefficient depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value sm@@ ooth@@ es evenly across all directions , whereas a value is near 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will generate a high level of wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts will be best at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum gl@@ itter factor above all . p then defines the relative humidity . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is sm@@ ooth@@ ed . this is necessary to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repe@@ ats : returns as often the algorithm . usually 1 or 2 is usually enough .
An@@ gled step@@ ping ranges from &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle depend@@ ant integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , it should be small as well . be sure to create small angle a long run@@ time . you should therefore choose this value to be the wid@@ est possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral step@@ per size &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more to quality you get through the selection of this option is only minimal . it doubles the duration . therefore we recommend it to allow him .
the buttons saving as and loading exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below , you can see how image errors will be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used in a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . the original picture is caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; rocket production is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filter to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair , to remove . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tut@@ orial .
the screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been done with a digital camera and an high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain size that can be removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the under@@ window details and the under@@ window advanced settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . great values increase the time that filters per pixel can be applied and the image is sm@@ ooth@@ ed through the radius and the color in it becomes sm@@ ooth@@ ed and so that smaller flaws were cleaned .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ening unit . this value sets the pixel distance between the filter , and if it is increased , you will need to re@@ adjust the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and r@@ ushing or lubric@@ ating again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the edge . this value increases the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , cannot be removed all the noise or noise @-@ tops can occur . put it on a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts without any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance , to improve a picture . these settings will not affect the performance process by the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance , to improve a picture . these settings will not affect the performance process by the details pane .
gamma : controls the game tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically ar@@ ys stronger , but also the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the alignment of the ph@@ er@@ d absorption . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges may appear . if it is too high , can remove r@@ ushing and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . he can remove noise @-@ pointed and is the recommended method for this .
store and store : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters are used for rocket production which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and that was corrected using the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to make the picture a bit soft , is thank@@ fully much simpler than one image . use this tool to make the plas@@ tic@@ ist on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this surgery on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ i@@ red arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to emerge in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ tised images in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ tised images along the picture con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ tur@@ ation . the algorithm with another tool , the image defect , is performed . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ .2 and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas , even very far from it . as a los@@ s@@ less compression s@@ quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are visible in un@@ compressed image . this attitude should be correct .
the buttons saving as and loading exactly this . any adjustment of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
below , you can reduce the picture of a photo with par@@ fÃ¶r@@ mig@@ es . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can recognize the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures can be found on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts from the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mold Hot@@ pixel allows to remove hot@@ pixel photos from the camera with a CCD camera , eight were used . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are especially high @-@ quality raw material shots a problem , as many cameras have JPEG compression above a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; &quot; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is now no manual method to choose the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ zard with the button dark image . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to use the image directly inside the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD de@@ defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image . please note that the assistant not@@ ices the last dark image and re@@ loads this automatically in the next meeting .
the image field and preview can help you correct the result . the presentation window shows the output of the fil@@ ters with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all pre@@ defined areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the Fil@@ ters . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ cutting : an average of the neighbor @-@ pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ec@@ tives in a block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels , which have a distance from 1 pixel block , are drawn up to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel &apos;s pixel .
Kub@@ isch : all pixel with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , due to a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original picture has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ ungs@@ correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ ability , i.e. , to correct corners .
wide angle lens , particularly in the medium and large photo format , can often be lit up the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ ded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture , by reducing the light the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Ob@@ jec@@ tives also show this behavior .
however , it also has draw@@ backs . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should be , even with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise irregular effects can be created by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ tration and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by em@@ ulate a equivalent transformation to a rough image that is used without this filter . the algorithm uses an Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regulator , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ mask @-@ correction filter and with three more exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light ton@@ ic cushi@@ oning at the point of the largest density filter . the default density amounts to 2.0 , or randomly to compens@@ ate with an optical thickness of 2 , or randomly to compens@@ ate the density for a larger degree of vi@@ als , reduce it to compens@@ ate a small degree .
Leu@@ ch@@ intensity , Con@@ trast and Gamma Settings : the editing of a image with Vig@@ net@@ t@@ ting correction reduces the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls provide only positive values , as you have to increase the settings .
if you want a more subtle change of exposure of the target picture , let the values for lumin@@ escent thickness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ lt ; image processing of the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the correct picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ ord and Counter@@ f@@ correction was also done in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lenti@@ l di@@ stortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion . colour@@ less di@@ stortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the second degree is treated , the general geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third @-@ degree has a similar concent@@ rate effect , but fl@@ att@@ ened to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth @-@ degree angle correc@@ ts the remote corners of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ ric di@@ stortion can be almost eliminated .
generally : this value controls the strength of the second @-@ grade order . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped di@@ stortion can be corrected and positive values are cus@@ hion di@@ stortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the di@@ stortion fourth @-@ degree . this value looks more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse number of parameter general .
zoom : this value is re @-@ scale the image size and leads to a correction first by . negative values enlarge during positive the picture .
brigh@@ ter : this value is adjusted to the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview of the correction correction . the values you are using for your image , are stored and the next start as standard values are used .
the tons or cus@@ hion @-@ correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes . in case you perform this correc@@ ting as all the first . if you can re@@ arrange a picture and then carry a tons @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong of Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction you can find this tool a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , like the ocean side or a building screen , in your image and press the left mouse button in order to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the tons / cus@@ hion di@@ stortion with the help of lines .
if you correct a cus@@ hion di@@ stortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove this with the cut tool in the menu transform@@ ers or remove from the image processing or over the zoom kno@@ b of this dialog .
for most pictures the tons @-@ shaped correction came from . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective so that you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight di@@ stortion of perspective .
this is an example of the tons @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate Infr@@ ared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ Infr@@ ared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can add two parameters to sim@@ ulate film gra@@ dation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controls changes the quantity of the film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter channels to re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter image used on a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the fin@@ ishers .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; filter film grain is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , to enhance the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers of the photographic body of the photo@@ emul@@ sion .
the film rate effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , road photographic , gra@@ iny appearance , especially into your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film critic inside a black / white picture applied . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil paintings . it uses an ur@@ istic legal algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil paintings . nature paintings and styles are well suited for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for large pictures . smooth the smooth or , from the other side , the char@@ ms .
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel screen size is 1 and plain 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal cartridge . therefore , pictures of their gra@@ dients are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon sign filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved further by adju@@ sting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter engraving marks your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug , filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mo@@ ve@@ able landscape .
the depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using di@@ stortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : share the image in cells and look like if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wavel@@ ength 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 , the image is dist@@ orted with another version of glass @-@ blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the kno@@ b button .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom shar@@ pen : wi@@ pes the image along the crop @-@ shaped lines starting from a centre . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and produces a dynamic expression of often in sport photography .
radi@@ al shar@@ pen : wi@@ pes the image by rotating the pixel to a centre . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distances : s@@ wis@@ s the picture around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to occur in the background .
movement shar@@ pen : wi@@ pers the image by horizontal movement of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft tissue : wi@@ pes the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny smooth focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating a romantic portrait , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle light .
bulk soli@@ ds : wi@@ pes the image by chance shift the pixel and sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color basin in the picture and caught this without the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and is then created by the col@@ t with an average pixels value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make shelves on your picture . thus , it gives natural your pictures a good appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected protected algorithm .
drop size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop @-@ size does not automatically increase the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish does change the optical effect of drop in the image .
you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing a range free of shelves . use the range of tools to stay freely . if you start to run the shelves , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the shelves . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through mir@@ r@@ oring or rotating in the right direction . the tools you can find in the menu transform@@ ers and trans@@ forming spi@@ der .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you obtain a picture and keep the details sharply ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here is a good job here . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ former size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for size can change an linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to eliminate the pixels . if you want a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. split inter@@ pol@@ ation for the increase of a picture . &amp; digi@@ tization ; uses a further developed approach . the under@@ lying algorithm photo was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
retained aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the entry of the new size is preserved the aspect ratio of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is sm@@ ooth@@ ed . this is necessary to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons saving as and loading will be used exactly . each entry for photo can be saved as text file , and later re@@ loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very quick with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating , by adding a small color picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard penis comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequent operation , but also a frequent tool to put together a picture . in order to cut a photo with the mouse , simply press the rect@@ angle with the mouse , pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then move the mouse .
if you get rid of the mouse button , the area of the photos will be cut off . this allows you to change a good review like your photo after cut @-@ up . you can create the size of the cut @-@ up by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by pushing it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button 1 button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file store or file store using file to store the newly added photo .
in the pre@@ text area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue remains .
in accordance with aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width of the width .
the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a single aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you can see inches , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically mark the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below , you can use the Max . ratio kno@@ b to the area for cutting on the wid@@ est possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool according to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the aspect ratio ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are mir@@ ro@@ red the image and not the original picture .
enabling assistance to help , assist you to put together your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ious triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ re@@ ins , harmon@@ ious triangles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similar harmon@@ ious triangles .
golden center : the golden middle is a divi@@ ding to various natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the pet@@ als of a sunflower . it appears in all sorts of things that we find as beautiful .
the golden partition is the Ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times if you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually followed as a visually harmon@@ ious .
the golden center puts liquid aid lines at your disposal when you set up a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring good results to your target . compared to third @-@ thirds , the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow .
another rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , even golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to direct the golden spiral . it may be a line , or different objects . this one can just be there without the eye , it will fulfill his job .
the golden triangles is also discussing the golden spiral . their failure points are the middle points of the sides of the golden frame . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ is@@ cu@@ ous triangles . diagonal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic .
if you use golden triangles to break your frame around your frame , create an effect from professional photography , dynamic sy@@ mm@@ etry . try to place your focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t achieve .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . on this type , you can adjust the color of the lines your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera horizont@@ ally horizont@@ ally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things are shot at an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select Trans@@ forming free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . with the button pre@@ ferences you can set the blade back to 0 degrees . a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown right above .
for your help , the module is provided with a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse pointing out in the image preview to fix it over an important point of the image . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after fil@@ ming an image , you &apos;ll find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . possibility to repair it , it is the function transformation to utili@@ ze cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cut out . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option sm@@ ooth@@ es the picture a bit after turning . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ an transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image . the preview of the dialog is calculated automatically . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog box you will find some information to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas produced by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas produced by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left at the top : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degree at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the current angle in degree at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adju@@ sting the perspective the picture becomes somewhat lost . for individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one possibility to transfer this is the picture with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
the device tool is used to shift a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite image . this is no rotation , the image is dist@@ orted to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module via trans@@ forming scissors .
make your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you push the horizontal angle , press the angle to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown right from the pattern .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your picture .
after which you have done the dra@@ ining , the picture becomes a bit caught . for a single shot , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two c@@ ort@@ uring is twice as much s@@ wis@@ s and therefore you should avoid this .
after crossing the picture has the picture of un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is the picture with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write in some cases , depending on your system and , in some cases , from the type such as these libraries comp@@ ile , you will edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ plug .
because of these depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . but they will always be JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F under them .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ res ; shows only files in formats that know . this happens using file extension and comparison with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension in the list is shown , you can also modify this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ p@@ iers . in the section configuration , you can find further information .
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the format used . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression technique to digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also be saved if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the resource format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ ing@@ Converter of &amp; digi@@ plug . in the section configuration , you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ plug .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ iers ; supports the store of Roh@@ ing@@ ers only supported with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. all cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . below shows a short list of raw form@@ att@@ ines which came from &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format . if you click on a film file , but also don &apos;t have any built @-@ in options to view or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ p@@ added ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playing movies use the program to playback the program .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can conduct the first four alignment with the White Module .
many tools that you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , pl@@ asti@@ ci@@ zing , noise supp@@ ression , ref@@ uses , irregular m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a unified di@@ alog@@ ical type that is applied to the actual picture before the filter is applied to the current image below . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the compar@@ ision of the compar@@ ing area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically , without dup@@ lic@@ at . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ at . the upper range shows the original and the lower part of the filter is applied to the area below the selected preview range .
split ver@@ tically . the left area displays the original and the right to comparison the effect of the film .
horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in pre @-@ looking , and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on , to show over@@ - and under@@ lining . the used colors can be adapted in the general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame is a preview of preview . you can draw this frame with the mouse inside the image and see on the part of the image that you want to see di@@ e@@ preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is being updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all entries from the last use of the module are marked .
the side@@ bar features displays the essential information on the selected image and is largely expl@@ ain@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters at the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider is an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; push it button on the left side . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move a square . all images within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , it requires your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit red pal@@ ettes and to choose and ren@@ ame colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can apply either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , you are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ settings and hot user defined color and pay@@ ed colors .
in dialogue palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the files according to files .
the cur@@ sor will be displayed in the palm view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a colour .
it shows on the color . the color is described under the palm view . here you can also change the color name .
it can also be used to ej@@ ector . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to make the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse with pressing left mouse button .
if the check box is inserted under the button color , the color will be inserted into the cur@@ sor position . the color will be inserted either , or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be adjusted by selecting the cross@@ box over@@ write under the cur@@ sor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by another color . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit .
the colors in the range and the output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a colour somewhere on the screen and then select it in the color select on the left .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z . programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are not a modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alise graph@@ s . programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z file ; includes , are according to the program author &apos;s out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the features of an integrated &amp; K@@ DE .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ene . graph@@ s with all possibilities of an integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a modification of the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s is calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the Graph@@ ene in &amp; Kate ; to open or add Graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in one &amp; Kate ; -@@ Compon@@ ent to be opened
loading of large Graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program , which is the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . requires in detail :
the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in its own under@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer . in this case , the main window will open the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Inclu@@ ding files . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is bigger than the character area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
using the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below , you can see the maximum size of a graph .
if the straight in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; charged file has been changed from another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose if the Gra@@ ph will be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; may your choice also do it , so that later you can change your choice later , you can set up the menu option settings ; set up ... see , see also .
if you open a graph outside of running &amp; graph@@ er ; -@@ instance , open &amp; eg ; in file brow@@ sers or by command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; cr@@ us@@ viewer ; instance , want to display or to @-@ lad@@ ed graphite in a sub @-@ window of the already current instance .
as with the last option you can store your choice permanently , but they can also change it with the setup dialog .
for the program start , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice but later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple sites , you can choose if the parts of the graph will be attached to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph .
preview with one on several sides distributed graphite without head@@ line and with another font
the page again gives the opportunity to determine the behavior when a file has changed on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can specify a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or program any time .
the page is open to open the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer . when a graph is open outside a current session , you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window , or specify in a window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the site seat management gives the opportunity to determine the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer . you can specify a default behavior ( open files at the last meeting or not ) or determine , at each start to be asked .
the context menu , usually with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; will be opened , further features :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z . layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for geri@@ atric graph@@ s . the algorithm produces the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges , as possible as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ used graphite . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm uses , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical more dimensional economies .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for un@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ s a spr@@ ing@@ y model . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istic and includes a multi @-@ leaf trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphite .

using this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import / convert your stored images in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original port of Him is not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it creates the same results as the software from your camera makers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , choose the RA@@ W file to be converted , and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the White . the key parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue amp@@ lif@@ iers may be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays right and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
in case you have to edit your images frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format , as it &apos;s only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a disk format , met@@ ad@@ ata files will be stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file stored in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings you can start with the kno@@ b button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it .
the stac@@ king machine mode allows you to convert different images on one time . so , use this mode , i.e. by testing on a single picture which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if this has been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview of progress is not available . progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to com@@ press all images in an album . it uses the image from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of an album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the time to be used .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the image program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image and enlarge . these are four types of the image change available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . width or height of the image will be automatically selected , depending on image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for instance to adapt your picture to screen size .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printer preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo pressure . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , rim size and background colour , is adapted accordingly .

the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . its configuration is stored and each time used until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you &apos;ll need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file the comments to the pictures into a text file is joined and the mail included .
the P@@ NG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG , if you have a fast internet connection and should not be changed the photo quality . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and select the original files in JPEG format , the original output data will be added to the displayed photos .

in this section , you can define how to look at the HTML page . most of the settings are clear , why this is not specifically made here .
below the page you can adjust various resolutions for the pictures . as a result , those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 , do not download images for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . thus , it can browse your pictures with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time , browse . if he want to get a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting range , specify the different folder and URL , where your website is stored .
most of all your HTML files choose a base file and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically select for any future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if you &apos;re really looking for a URL . if you choose a URL , a web browser , after the pages have been created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
in the case that the HTML files you do not have to copy it manually . in order to copy the import function , see , right , you need to specify the final goal of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folder are located .
the just described application options have referred all three based on basic file and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder , whose name you define in output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may , of course , want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures , reception , etc. to add , then you &apos;ll have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even once .
using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other files into your database . image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file whether the pictures itself is stored in the file , or whether the file can be stored in the file , that you can have all pictures together and share this file so independently . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures in two ways . first , the images are found in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL , which you have created with the creation of HTML files , will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , dialogue for export images is described , which you can export the file via the file ... call .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether there is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available :
in the Manu@@ ally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the pictures into the same file as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automati@@ cally to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not able to com@@ press the files . if you want this , simply select the export file .
the last option of this page is limited maximum image size . if you want to send your friends picture , you want to limit the images maybe not in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here , you can limit the size that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select , will import &amp; playback database as described in described .
the assistant to import is made of four steps . first you need to select which pictures you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it can be that you are calling the Category individuals to imp@@ ose the file ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called upon your database . therefore , you will be imported in the third dialog window , which should be imported into the categories of the imported file , and what categories do they represent in your database .
in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the image .
it must be easy to browse pictures and look at : if you see images , you often want to view images from your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures shown on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will see the different steps taken from ( 1 ) determining the information on your pictures , above ( 2 ) the searches and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it was extended and today your videos will take care of . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this is also videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their pictures . this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice , such as Normal backup tools , back on a disk or revisions in the CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your pictures are saved and use this at future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry settings the photo album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual will be explained to you the various setup possibilities .
on the left you can see six different symbols , which allows you to access the options and options for the viewer . for each setting , an extensive help is available , you can access the F1 key and click on the desired option .
it was described as you can define various features for each image , such as persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
you can see dialogue , which is used to handle already existing groups . for any existing group you can select a labelling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue options , you can set up complete members of the members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a mid@@ gli@@ can .
in the list of sub@@ ordination , you can select the setting options available to you . with the above select list , you can select the category you want . in the left window , a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it shares his mod@@ ulation system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; Image Plu@@ gin Interface . n@@ avi@@ e information about this you can find on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
modules can be accessed via the modules . modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules yourself .
since the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it can be that the modules use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you should always use new modules using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu help . do not say , I wouldn &apos;t have been warned !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I have been very different , making it be very different , making some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums : this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
to sim@@ ulate the photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , i.e. all the pictures that show you the picture shows at the moment .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &apos;s the photo album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all persons , then every entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category which you have specified in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you are using the category characters , you will be selected using a photo album , so if you choose to view it and give it to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . please select the setup dialog , and select module , which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example for a start screen when you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; starting with your own pictures .
as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you can see the window with which you can browse your picture database . at the moment we will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we will display on this window , but now click here to show you an overview of all available images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any image with notes on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images to be shown simultaneously . if , for example , Jes@@ per is illustrated and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all of these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in section . if you want , you can see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text box by offering people , places and keyword . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again , when you type information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the shifting of images within the list : if you have a family party and shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be shown , so that the names used by the names are post@@ pon@@ ed , the people can find faster and allocated .
if you prefer to get a alphabetical list below , click on the icon for sort by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image , you might need to edit all selected images and have these images with notes . in this case , just click on the button and back buttons that are located under the preview of the image right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and select the menu option more than a note on once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all listed in the United States . besides San Francisco and Los Angeles , California .
on the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the House Supp@@ lements , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can also put an entry into a category and add it to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the template dialog by setting the glue that form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by pulling him outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to store the current construction and the appearance of the window .
you can also check out a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and here then window / trigger . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the record images in your browser , you &apos;ll get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures if you do not have filters . an example of this you can see here . you can try the size of the preview of mouse , by simply pointing down pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button . try it simply .
if you set a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture . if you do not have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding pictures you want to er@@ ase and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select the Edit menu . now , you will see the window displayed in the image .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures anywhere without having stored on the hard disk . of course , you &apos;ll have to record the pictures anywhere , so you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures of the hard disk can be loaded .
pictures where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , images are present , making &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the preview of this picture . however , you can also watch these images with the image viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it again . if you want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the relevant CD until now . if you like trouble , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to open for others and click on top view menu . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures you want to see and pick your little sister .
with this , you have set what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you want to un@@ lock the images of your little sister , simply select the menu entry , see the images that you want to display , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered , to un@@ lock the images . in order to establish this password , simply select password change in the menu privacy .
please remember that this picture protection cannot be safe if you can find all pictures on the hard drive and to others , any one can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text , or delete this type of password protection . this type of password protection has only to be familiar with those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to spoil the view of private pictures .
the reason why you want to manage all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is natural for you to describe them sometime . for this reason , you &apos;ll have to look at some point . for this reason , the photo album features a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview of how described .
the viewer can see you in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all information you use about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can easily configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . that then , you can see the text @-@ text menu below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on this browser , see , matching entries at this point . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and return back by using the keys image high and image down . you can reach the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as Di@@ ash@@ au . if there is a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can press a new image by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or minus the button and stopped the se@@ ash@@ au by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of viewing of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it in full@@ screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full@@ screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the image and zoom out . with the mouse , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . the Plus key zo@@ om@@ t is shown in the middle of the image and shows the result of the zo@@ oming .
with the point @-@ key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the rec@@ ol@@ it@@ aste the zo@@ oms , so each pixel is equivalent to a pixel &apos;s pixel screen .
note that the only zo@@ oming operations that work in videos that are in and zoom out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the shooting functions from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . you can &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu entry notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures you can see a picture with a person whose name you will have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you &apos;ll probably prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to launch the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you &apos;ll see one after another .
for the two examples above gives you the viewer viewing the opportunity to see images with tra@@ its while viewing them . features are the letters A @-@ Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . see a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have any attributes added to your pictures , these are available in your browser . so , you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you can view the categories in D@@ re preview , then you can press features to the picture by simply press the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you to paint a photo album ; on the picture .
the painted will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the type you can revers@@ ed your talent later .
in a picture you can see a picture on the painted . to put the painting from the text menu . to put the painting out of the text menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the top of the window .
in order to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to work on the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ master , but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should not have read and understood .
in the property @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then , the properties are displayed in the object properties and shown the object in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are fl@@ es possible positions , the following menu will be displayed , so that you can choose the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the right @-@ text menu to the right mouse menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changes properties , click on Apply to take advantage of these changes . if you have inv@@ alid values , a message will be corrected with a error message . then you can correct the input error , click on application or dis@@ rup@@ ting the changes .
if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; file documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download them here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the documentation .
if you are making a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Economic View View@@ ing View .
press a look ahead in the future view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . if you want to select a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can draw these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is selected , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and turning as well as position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window .
each object has a visual performance . you can specify this value relatively to the level of level or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their level of level smaller or equal to the visual display of the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object properties will be displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window settings , or if you need a different arrangement , you can also store them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under a separate view , drag the attachment to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the attachment to the right or left side of a view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you wish to arrange several views over each other , drag the attachment to another view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map posts up in the views .
the last possible window order rules are floating views : views that are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the attachment to the desktop or click on the small upward pointing arrow in the attachment bar .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the collection bar . to prevent the loop , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you will find entries for any type of views . new views are web@@ bing , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with view window settings ... store . it will be a dialog displayed in which you can save the window settings under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . as this manual is written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering the symbol ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu entry .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to the highest quality .
if you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , or in the tool@@ bar menu , or in the menu view R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... choose the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , choose the cross@@ word section and enter the image section to ren@@ dering in input fields .
in combination field quality , you can select the features that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user refle@@ ctions lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties will be found in the User manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
if a picture contains just a beam of pixels , different errors can be created . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ Ã¨ pattern or stu@@ ds effects in ben@@ ds and lines , and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this defect . in general , pictures with this feature better look better .
if you turn back anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is constantly divided again and adap@@ tive because every pixel depends on the calculated depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray works a beam each pixel . if the difference between the color values will be processed and then both pixels will be calculated with the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the lowest value on 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated with an extra value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixels , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue in the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel which can be followed individually and checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ u@@ sion can be adjusted with depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is reducing the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light refle@@ ctions . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map , you can set if the alpha channel should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object taken .
opening a new window for viewing the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; file output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; file to import , select the file entry file import ... and select a file from the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can move objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code to import file in the Editor . to import objects into the scene , select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object @-@ tree .
with copying and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendered . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the aid view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . here you can find the path to your copy and the version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ vi@@ st@@ ats ) into the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder , you need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different ways of the library , the first connected file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in camera view and in the window @-@ type license plates .
you can adjust the points of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid , separate for shifts , sc@@ aling , and turning .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions .
if you cross the high details on advanced projections , all wire model views will be further divided into the camera . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall will be displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
when you cross the bottom , one floor underneath the objects is rendered . the floor will be displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours .
if you want to activate the check rates , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering scenes . values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more precise information about parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window direc@@ tives . in the section window orders are explained , as you can create and store instructions .
the drop @-@ down menu arrangement : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can add and delete a selected arrangement with the kno@@ b button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can create and delete the button , and remove selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ting board the window under the existing window , with box map you get a view of card view together with the previous view and web@@ bing . view not in main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now want to start without further knowledge of the two programs . if you can create all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on a plane .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you complain about that you use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you do not adjust camera , no rules for ren@@ dering are applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t add light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive a black picture .
if you have everything wrong , see the first startup of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et wind@@ settings are :
take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
these menus and symbols are often used right now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees all the scene you produce . in particular , you notice the view from the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene .
the property @-@ tree now includes a new entry with the designation camera . if you click on it , you &apos;ll see the content of the view characteristics to find the various parameters of the camera . in the User Doc@@ umentation &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find more details .
change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera can change in view points , with which you can change the camera &apos;s target . simply click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired spot .
if you push the button Apply or SIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E , the wire model views and the property @-@ tree are changing immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera here .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you might add a cube ( inser@@ ting final body qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s an aw@@ k@@ ward way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as the floor :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button Apply or SIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E . in the property tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model list now shows the level , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane stretches out to the horizon .
if you can check out the object tree , you will find that you click on the item + before the object . in this case you can only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the bottom to the practice a unit below the horizontal line , just so that you should know some of these parameters . select shift and put the values as follows :
first choose the floor to set out his material characteristics . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialogue in which you can select how the object is added . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the objective view ( name = Floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of Pig@@ ments only features a Matt@@ es black material because you can still have settings for the pig@@ ment still . do not think that you can check the look of the materials anytime with a click on a preview of view . now , there are many possibilities for the pig@@ ment . again , there are many possibilities , but now take the sim@@ pl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see any color on Qu@@ ader and sphere , click on the button Apply and then click the preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ dering your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , you are not the color list you &apos;ve expected . here are further settings needed . in the color list you need to select two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this page more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the property @-@ tree every time imagin@@ able and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to run this step as you model the basic methods of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you already understand . the ball can be just as easy as the floor :
in view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the SIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E or the button Apply ) , so the ball would stick over the floor , because you have shi@@ fted the floor for a unit down@@ wards .
of course the ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have selected the sphere , you can now indicate a material . like the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color :
choose erotic object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pig@@ ment , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; En@@ colored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and put the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on Apply or press the ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E .
the at@@ titudes of gloss effect and reflection has already shown partly good visual effects , perfectly suited for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : even not selected is :
you should now have a good impression of which options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; yet . hopefully you &apos;ve lear@@ nt so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which reflect the scenes ) by every pixel &apos;s perspective , which reflects the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources can be used . so the scene pixels is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see nothing , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source , you see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , any scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default dialog box , you can select a file that you &apos;ve done before using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created
whenever you open a new model or create , insert the file into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space .
the scene is re@@ produced in the last stored release . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since last saved .
you can only select this menu entry , if you don &apos;t have any stored changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the most revers@@ ed command . select this menu entry , then select , if you use editing options .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialogue in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write a existing arrangement .
in this menu , you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the key@@ note and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify the short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands or add new commands .
open a dialog to set up the tool bar . you can add and remove tool@@ ols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add commands and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ Map is an option to prepare rough surfaces , without requiring any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these plots . these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ball @-@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in your own window , in the size of the image or in full@@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball @-@ show ; is very easy . the file brow@@ sers that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return Return can be shown .
you can adjust if any image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a certain file , simply tap the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue - &amp; ball @-@ show ; there are five boxes cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the mode of operation and short commands for the browser , the key@@ note may be specified for the respective window .
if this is selected , the images are open in full@@ screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can continue down below . default is not a full screen .
if this point is activated , invites &amp; ball @-@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you want to watch the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ball @-@ show ; at moving the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ball @-@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can find &amp; ball @-@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is extended for large pictures the display window on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
speci@@ fies whether the slide show is supposed to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected picture .
the period between the image changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field , or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is set as long until it is broken off by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value in input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the button abbrevi@@ ation for the various operating modes of &amp; ball @-@ show ; in the box cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ piece view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window around .
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
shows small icons for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
shows predic@@ tive pictures for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .

&amp; show@@ photo is a project that is supported by a community . so , users and developers are able to help each other . if you wish to answer any other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; here you will soon answer other users of other users . in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you will soon be spoken English . this language is therefore powerful .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . guidance to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you much control over his working processes as possible . there are many options to select the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to select on this settings , you must set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the area exposure Indi@@ cators , you can select the color that is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indi@@ an indicator has been selected , the colors with what you are to display in contrast . under@@ lining should display a bright color and exposure to a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; possesses a side bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions to the selected pictures . the same page bar is also available in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes pictures to scan and wi@@ ther .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan and wi@@ ther than images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save and save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before departure .
you can review the status of your scanner at the s@@ ane project side by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ in@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened , or if no standard scanners are specified , there will be a dialog to choose the scanner .
users can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner , exit the scanner and exit the scanner ; exit .
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat these options .
to insert a picture , the user can only start a pre @-@ pause and then scan an scanning area for the final scan . the Pre@@ sch@@ aus@@ can is started by a preview button .
to choose the image better , the user can zoom in and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview can fit into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if there is a preview of Featured in the Settings , the image is displayed in a preliminary window , as shown below . if storing is pressed , then the image is stored and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a departure and you get into the main window .
through the button settings the same name is open before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
users can look at the picture if desired , look at before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to choose the type of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images stores each image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite open the dialog before each single sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically is supposed to save with a generated name in a previously defined file , then you must first ask for asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where images should be stored in the option without following a file name . if the images are saved according to each scan , the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically stored images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix that will be uploaded automatically if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value does not change the compression value when selecting the image quality , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to end .

you may need to set existing multimedia buttons to work that they operate as &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ Short Cross@@ ing . as a result , make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ arok ; -@@ Control Centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the COP function could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use the dialog , so that the user is not running .
start the &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ and@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE binding for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the scripts scripts / templates you will find a lot of submission scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply use them to expand the required functions . you will quickly find that writing of scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; the use of each K@@ DE installation should lie .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands to execute external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be accessed relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ arok ; sends al@@ erts to all current scripts . in this reason scripts will be able to monitor their standard input and respond appropri@@ ately to events . of course , a script may also ignore the events if there is no use for this .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the file folder on the folder , where all data should be stored .
Tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script might now query &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions ask further information about the new piece ( for example , met@@ ad@@ ata or the denom@@ ination ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change of volume . the volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ization : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title , Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list . to add a user defined menu entry , you can use the D@@ COP function d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) to remove d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) .
before &amp; am@@ arok ; stop or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ arok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. recording studios , such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed using a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) which can be used as well as b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; am@@ arok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension cat@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages immediately .
the main release must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Viking Script &apos;s side of &amp; am@@ arok on . for your entry to K@@ DE @-@ apps you should use the Category am@@ arok ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; am@@ arok ; has many useful and powerful features and still is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ arok ; you can simply draw music into the play@@ list instead of endless menus . maybe you can only look for a very particular title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ arok ; &apos;s Collec@@ tors browser and the Quick Search will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have already lost some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then if the play@@ list is still difficult for you . and if your decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
usually you have to set the following folder from Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ arok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker , you should not have any problems with comp@@ ile . if you encounter problems , please tell the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ arok ; does most of the applications enable some options to activate or dis@@ able the configure script with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , so that they can be used . details in the section system requirement .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; am@@ arok branches , you should use full .
&amp; am@@ arok ; can be set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ arok ; .
player windows automatically powers the Player window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window is displayed .
tuning bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
convincing design : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . this allows the used color scheme to change bar@@ ometer .
tuning files are removed from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ arok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored on the location of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder from &amp; am@@ arok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose what browser of &amp; am@@ bition should be started when a browser is required .
other brow@@ sers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not located in the list below .
play@@ list if you want to save , save the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; am@@ arok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list .
relative paths to manually edit play@@ lists : if you turn this setting , &amp; am@@ arok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , starting from the location of the play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
as a current piece in the piece of play , it causes the play@@ list window / roll@@ ers to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when switching change to context @-@ browser changes automatically the context @-@ browser , once the next piece is played .
in the section image you can adapt &amp; am@@ arok ; s appearance . the section is part of the section in three parts .
in the font section , you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ bition ; you can select writings for the following areas : play@@ lists window , player windows and context browser . press on expressions ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with a selection of user @-@ defined color scheme you can define your choice and can define your own color scheme . in addition , use the color options for front and background colour .
reproduction starts at the start , that &amp; am@@ arok ; after the program starts the reproduction will continue with the piece on the spot , with whom it has been stopped at the last stop .
the under@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to set up the switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click here to select from dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ box shadows causes that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD .
own colours are available to you the opportunity to adapt the O@@ SD colours for writing and background . click on the color surface opens the dialog to color selection . if your own colours are not enabled , the default &amp; K@@ DE colours are used .
the input field display text indicates the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by means of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to its own needs . below , you can find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users . so you can design@@ ate the screen on a multi @-@ way monitor environment on the O@@ SD .
the audio @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio @-@ driver from the select box . some drivers are able to activate more adjustment possibilities in this box map .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ arok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder in the collection , mark the cross@@ roads next to its name . this section also includes check@@ box fields to adjust as with the selected folders .
as well as a sub@@ folder : this causes &amp; am@@ bition ; both the cross @-@ crossed as well as their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder .
monitor changes : allows &amp; am@@ arok ; to monitor selected files added to changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to allow the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import@@ ing : causes that &amp; am@@ arok ; all found play@@ lists are added to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the play@@ lists automatically appear in play@@ lists .
the part of Collec@@ tors database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another device is required in the window of MySQL .
the MySQL @-@ Setup is used to set the database for &amp; am@@ arok ; used under calcul@@ ator : if the database is set , on which the MySQL database is located . then , under the port : the network port is accessed below which the database is achiev@@ able . name : is the database name to which the connection is produced .
use us@@ ername : and password : to specify the data that needs to connect to the database .
the cart@@ ei@@ card paved .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ arok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your user name and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ arok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your pay@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar perform@@ ers are retri@@ eved : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; am@@ arok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ts to each played each piece . note : you may not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ arok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and gallery photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the Package K@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including those included programs , because &amp; am@@ arok ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ ile K@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD are predic@@ ting that your window managers support the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to assist am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these places an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ arok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report the cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of the matter is the fact that Tag@@ li@@ b is provided with reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer in bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , then try SQ@@ Lite . the support for it in &amp; am@@ arok ; is something more mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ arok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; am@@ arok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then turn off automatic . turn off when in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace to the e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically at a crash ) . if there is a common crash , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many program data write as UTF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not describe as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .

&amp; am@@ arok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list ) can be easily forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can easily detect the status center under appearance icons . this can be found in some cases up to three times on a symbol , until this attitude shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : in@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixels , then check whether am@@ aro@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be shown with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ant Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that am@@ aro@@ K finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems engage in the ligh@@ test through the help of an expert on your uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or at the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # am@@ arok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a mistake , if you find something about the correction of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the launch of &amp; am@@ arok ; only an empty play@@ list appears . how come there music pieces now ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start @-@ bottom window turned into the statistics window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the importance of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated for the assessment by the user while the points will be calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the play@@ list must be displayed in the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column evaluation . click somewhere in the new application column to determine the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is located in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from repe@@ ating menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse into the play@@ list and let them fall there , just as you would like it with other files . so simple : - )
in the tool bar of the play@@ list , next to the add @-@ button , the button is back play@@ list . click on it .
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el package and install &amp; am@@ arok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very beautiful visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find him about the menu bar under ex@@ tras ...
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; am@@ arok ; uses a back@@ end @-@ independent approach , hence the actual question of what media types is supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support this pretty much every single audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer may even support text and p@@ ng !
it may be ! maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with default no MP3 decoder are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ uation reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , EIN@@ G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ arok ; play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously available audio mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem and help a solution . if you want to specify a different S@@ ink , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink .
the doing &amp; am@@ arok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ coded first . if you want to send an MP3 to AL@@ SA . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and send the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer may type directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound@@ servers with highest priority ( real time pri@@ ori@@ ety ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ ef@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is adjusted :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause to create playback . read this error report . read the magni@@ fying sound of sound in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , instead g@@ amer or x@@ ine instead , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the faster data de@@ co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ t _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimised for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the g@@ amer driver , then crash@@ es &amp; am@@ bition . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . perform G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ amer .
try this ( finish off am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg down , comp@@ ile and install it . then , go to G@@ ST register files and once again as your normal user . delete the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run the G@@ ST register again . now start &amp; am@@ arok ; .
please report it on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g if you have an entire list of suggestions / wishes , send them best to our mailing list : am@@ arok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . put in your calendar program an alarm and release the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ arok player play
this command leaves &amp; am@@ arok ; playback the playback . make sure that &amp; am@@ arok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be caught by the gentle tones of music which you have stopped in front of the bed .
how to know the currently in &amp; am@@ arok ; ongoing titles if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functional SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows : this command gives you Interpre@@ t and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ arok player now@@ n
replace IP address with your IP and your current us@@ ername with your user name . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; am@@ arok on the &amp; am@@ arok window . press on the keyboard and the current analyst opens in an independent , in the size alter@@ able window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights mou@@ st@@ aste makes a piece in the cli@@ c series into the queu@@ es . by pushing the ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E looking for a search in the play@@ list , the first search result is played and the search returned .
OK , the player windows and the play@@ list have great functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the Control bar ?
click on &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which brow@@ sers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ K , the collection database can not be created and the console shows a lot of errors . what now ?

place the CD , then click on the menu on audio CD . you can read a file browser with multiple folders . to read the wav file , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . to automatically add files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically , this creates the previous assessment with a decl@@ ining value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has each individual assessment on the overall result .
you can insert the assessment for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button in the play@@ list window . click here . then , you can click the review of a piece as well as all other attributes also , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : review on or edit : review on the dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . you can also change the assessment on the met@@ ad@@ ata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to publish when you want to publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan which is not assembled with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please enter the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of down@@ fall and thus caused a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; am@@ arok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ amer . therefore , the .@@ configure routine does not have compiled this output modules . you need to configure &amp; install ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ arok ; new installed , but the output modules are still not released . and now ?
presumably you use a distribution that is installed separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine dev@@ el . after that you have to re@@ comp@@ ile &amp; install ; re@@ comp@@ ile and install .

the management of the queu@@ es open you over ex@@ tras and then click on + . you can add the piece in the play@@ list and then click on + . you can use the pieces just using the mouse , or add the context menu in the play@@ list . the order of pieces can then change in the queu@@ es .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details to the establishment of this follow later ) .
fills your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during the playback .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires some pieces in your play@@ list . you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work with this dynamic play@@ list .
double click on the desired play@@ list , you pull it into the play@@ list window , or click the mouse button . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list . you should save the old play@@ list so under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ list mix immediately fill up your play@@ list and you can add the playback directly . the play@@ list will be added at least one piece themselves from your collection . the recommended pieces will always be filled with the next denom@@ inations , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , then activate the latest possible dynamic mode : at@@ titudes Dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as a starting point . the same menu entry may also be disabled again .
the button ref@@ illing the current play@@ list and adds new pieces accordingly to the dynamic mode . play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the corresponding settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the opportunity to edit , click on the editing of the play@@ list .
specify any name for the play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will be constantly growing , the setting for upcoming pieces will be over and they will be active in this play@@ list , however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed under attention of setting play@@ mate .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the play@@ list . thus , you can easily see what pieces were played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the play@@ list . if you set here more than 1 , the play@@ list will be continually growing , because only one piece is played and can be removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side were already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can already cross existing play@@ lists or intelligent play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , will add &amp; am@@ arok ; random pieces from each of the crossed play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on .
you can install new &amp; am@@ arok ; scripts that you can install on script . after selecting the script , a new entry will be installed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the internet . use the kno@@ b further scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select this to delete the script then click D@@ ein@@ manually .
if you are looking for information on writing own scripts , please check in the section letter of scripts according to scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization plug@@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; am@@ arok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ in . in order to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the cross@@ roads beside the name .
this quick installation will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps a audio CD is required . to complete the steps you have to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialogue window where you can select which files you want to burn on CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed formats , then remember that you &apos;ll get a worse quality during renewed , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is created . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss of loss format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .

V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully equipped car system to edit , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super video CDs .
Nor@@ mali@@ ze : this tool will be useful to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 collections ; without Nor@@ mali@@ ze the different sur@@ names of the different albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that can be re@@ printed differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux di@@ stro . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos at the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method , recently opened projects again . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on the entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is requested after a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed , using the file and file name for the project file .
save all the opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would save attention to each single project file .
includes the current project . if a project changes and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; following what should happen . you can then stop between storing and changes . furthermore , you can break off and keep the project so open .
includes all of the opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any stored project , what should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project file .
includes all open projects and finished &amp; ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any stored project will be asked what to happen , just as if you would have called the file .
if you call this entry , you can select the same effect as you select the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional kno@@ b burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened when the project has already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . every project type has different potential settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ Help ( re@@ achable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful when you use files for a multiple session CD . this is useful if you do not use files for a multiple session CD . it &apos;s more likely to be used for you to see the files available on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function initi@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium , they just don@@ t to imported files from imported files .
open the CD copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD which you should then burn even the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also want to copy c@@ annon if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create a DVD on another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a DVD with the help of copying the dialog . moreover , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying the dialog . moreover , the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
opens the dialog for a CD @-@ RW drives . so you can er@@ ase the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drives .
open the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD Â± R ( W ) format , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between the write modes and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously set CD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously generated DVD image . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ iso -@@ file as a data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
an earlier DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the selected video , code settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges .
shows information about the inserted medium . these information is represented in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small glue is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view one or off . the folder features an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is activated , the contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and un@@ lock the drive or throw of the medium .
switches the contents view , or from . the contents view allows to select and pulling out files into the projec@@ tors . the content view is also chosen to read audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the head bar in the projec@@ ting view or off . the head bar is a narrow area that contains only visible when the projection screen has no real function , it looks only pretty and divi@@ des the projections clearly from the remaining views .
this opens up a dialogue window to change the keyboard orders for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ note form below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; direc@@ ting assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you have to set up the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
open the settings from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general application settings will be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alise and commemor@@ ate the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many others &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , so your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the accompanying programs do you give .
in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then give something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below .
the Standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , formal DVD and other functions for creating new projects .

as a result of such a cre@@ at@@ e@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : the # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b provides the top listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ interface , which is applicable to data only on data ( CD and DVD ) :
from cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) of cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String units ) , add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) , ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path ) , ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) .
this makes it possible to fill a data @-@ project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ at@@ e@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ in / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; K@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it can be stored in an audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder of the machine installed .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; file data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and are supported for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . other co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this must now be done .
for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ th@@ erer has already be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary to comp@@ ile it yourself . but if FLA@@ C is not used , this installation is also not required .
which coefficient / file format should be used ? the Chap@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio Quality and Com@@ pressed factors .
a word for copying of protected audio CDs ; s : as already mentioned , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not possible to read any copy protection ; it is not possible to avoid any audio CD ; it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ing protection . simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ing protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only one needs to be performed ( the setup dialog can be found only so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , then a daily approach to read a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert many formats - depending on which co@@ aster programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can be &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything will be covered manually .
this is just a short list of commands of the main engine . on the page step , for example , further information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program maps for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB file on request of CD @-@ data according to the installation of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case first the connection to the internet are produced . )
start reading and - if a en@@ coder was configured in the Settings menu in the setup screen - the encoding .
open a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the standard . it is to be considered that the en@@ coder interface is configured in the configuration dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as Prot@@ ocols , pi@@ ep@@ ts ) for Progra@@ mmer ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main entry dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different box cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ders and compression rates , and helps you choose the right co@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format needs to be lost . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may today have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to high quality sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality in deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices are supported only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting makes good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 - 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approx . 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of the title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of the title . good Gen@@ ug for music from young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ ographic systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Insul@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most persons and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute top quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which are taken manually or by the program automatically fet@@ ched from the Free@@ D@@ b via the internet are available as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names , as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title Param@@ eters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database , in which people can download the information , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the machine . it is to be considered that here only one text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I am not attor@@ ney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so the information cannot be added to the artist or CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so all information can be obtained in a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; active is active as an address box ( sending an address ) . for the use of Free@@ D@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address , so it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from server ( This can only know the programmer who has reviewed the code . )
there are in many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; for use of Free@@ D@@ b , the ge@@ ographic is needed to use the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of refle@@ ctions on the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , you can download the complete database or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates on the database .
which evaluation program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know it more precise , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s to be aware that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet .
for storing the regular WAV files , the code reader can be selected as a file format for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less com@@ pressing for audio data ) on the tab of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the co@@ ders can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined code . additional information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installation of a co@@ di@@ er@@ ers , more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &apos; lame &apos; will be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this can have many causes . check the device of the device model of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could indicate what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; read the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , everything understood , but somehow still uns@@ afe to do something ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will set up the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) ranging from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as a pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for lame can be found as a non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source file , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have scre@@ amed on it ( eg ; by copying the con@@ quer@@ or something inside ) .
the first section handles the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , something that is supposed to be done only once and
the second section describes the action to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for any l@@ ashing &amp; CD ;
here we determine the content code for compression of the music ( lame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 - 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program using the Free@@ D@@ b program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
even though we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read out a &amp; CD because once the appropriate settings are found .
the device model is handed over to the program program that it can read &amp; CD ; data / pieces can read .
often / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the actual device @-@ name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM and / or DVD drives .
the General Settings menu . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be displayed / entered as shown in the screenshot .
only if in@@ complete information is in@@ qu@@ iring , so that you will be informed when information about the survey by keyword ( tags ) are missing .
the box CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downlo@@ ad@@ able via the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b machine .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet , so that it can access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , is a &amp; CD ; record found immediately , when you &apos;re un@@ happy with the database entry and the folder name directory , file name and file name , you can change easily and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to set everything manually , turn the select box and Free@@ D@@ b . however , you can download it twice as if you want to download the database before . however , this is more than 620 MB of size , if you have to be selected , the two box office must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following board map .
CD@@ DB is available for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ D@@ b server via the Internet . how can the system know which data will be the CD ? read the section about Free@@ D@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen photo .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look at a mirror @-@ server nearby . on this way , the load between the machines is distributed . however , this setting will work as first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as there are many fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ D@@ b server will suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel to read and en@@ code ? the author don &apos;t know it , so simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; throw at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined file for temporary files : when you cross this , then the path / folders can be specified in which the wav files are stored . if the field is not required , the files will not be displayed in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder , if you want to do something with the WAV files .
all you enter like it is on screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , something has to be b@@ lown to a right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be er@@ ased if necessary . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of subsequent alter@@ ation of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the names of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously en@@ coded WAV files : at a du@@ al@@ core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tempted to en@@ code more than a WAV file .
this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD comes out on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is set up and set up in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ D@@ b is to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any extended &amp; CD ;
since we use a &amp; CD ; you do not have a bit different from free@@ z@@ b , you see the screen photos a bit different than those for a &amp; CD ; with successfully delivered by Free@@ D@@ b . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually select from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , such as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and can be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not happening , then you are searching for questions and answers from the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched the Free@@ D@@ b , all tracks are already filled out , and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you do not have the check@@ box for the automatic query of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) you can manually trigger your local database , but select the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD Data and the title of the first unit
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be entered in the input field &apos; Updated title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ v@@ ell pro piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply together for all the tracks of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the Free@@ D@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names ( for example , if all words are beginning with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ i@@ red comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags ; this option is set up on the code map settings ; take a look inside the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ans and file formats . see in the help of the co@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information .
just select one entry , which is obviously matched with the style of the permitted CD ; this example is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; file data anyway . for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor appears again and you can see that the fields are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply type entries for the fields of the current piece . specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the play list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before any line of a piece . only the title is selected as selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or click on the button . select all the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
by clicking on the button selection , read the read process , this window appears on confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with orders and track what runs out .
click on the tab orders for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you &apos;re trying to work with a co@@ aster that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not successfully en@@ coded using a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the file for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have a write access to the file for temporary files and target files ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece of play .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . you can read and en@@ code the status below in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and coding . with powerful machines , the calcul@@ ator with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneously reading and en@@ code ( of however , two different pieces ) .
now the final title is read , while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is en@@ coded in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window is embedded for a short period in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is used today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the combined computer package . most distri@@ butions are already a pre@@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is addressed to people who comp@@ ile source files , and not intended to use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program your needs can be adapted once , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . you can read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading right ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked on the first start of the program , without any indication of this somehow empty screen ( especially when there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what &apos;s all about ? if you read this , probably the program has started . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author can &apos;t stop this manual . it &apos;s as the first version to add or change it , may it do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has understood this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .
strange when it has been able to get the source file from the &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others he has a real @-@ time graphics and karaoke @-@ real high@@ lighting of texts also some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; support &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the song text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphic presentation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the impressive buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go into &amp; K@@ DE ; each MIDI @-@ file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to move on K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedures used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; while playing a song , K@@ Mid starts with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the desired song .
you can also have a file from a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and get the kno@@ b button in the tool bar , choose the entry @-@ play from the menu piece or reset the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically once you move it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump at any point by using the medium mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click on the arrows on the left and to the right of the speed display and change the speed speed . to get back the original temp@@ o , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like a print on the button pause or select the menu option , inter@@ rup@@ ts the reproduction . if no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set up what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you have to set a song automatically . if you have selected the URL Settings menu , you will always have the opportunity to change this if you want the other way .
if you want to set out an event type , choose from the menu settings the entries of text events or song events . the same feature also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summar@@ ize . these are played in turn . in this section , how you can use the collections efficiently .
to set a collection , first open the Collection Manager . please visit the menu collection below the point .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then indicate the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set up the entries in the collection manager .
into the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember , if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected at the Collection Manager . there , you can add a song again with the kno@@ b . it appears again the file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic Add to the collection .
when automatic Add to the collection is enabled , a piece with opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be added automatically to the active collection .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you will need to open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on the removal .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu setting of the menu collections , the songs will be played in order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list on the karaoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the right .
to jump back to a song , select the button fore@@ word , the entry previous piece from the menu piece or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the Collection Manager , select the collection of delete collection , and click on the kno@@ b button .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter if it is stored at leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano as such as Change patch to dr@@ unk@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the respective file from hand ( with your favorite gate ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary conver@@ sions for playing a piece of play .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which is as often as desired . pre@@ mise for this is , however , that each of the occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D options ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your Map file as email , so I can use in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be designed for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , the patches from General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and do not throw any line to one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay all sounds you need to lay on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun type . this includes the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( th@@ umb@@ ago ) , Patch 100 ( the drum at your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in MIDI file .
please note that here , with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which every tone is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one that means sound height of the same drum means ( like some keyboards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how sounds will be shown on a specific channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence . thus , you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keyboards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sounds on the per@@ k@@ ine channel . look for example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to shift the first and second channel , you simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( general MIDI channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , you will be sure to use the Key@@ map option . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , Patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ k@@ ine patch on the per@@ k@@ ine channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio will be multiplied in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied and then for@@ warded with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , and then the value of 40@@ 96 is used so that no dec@@ imal number is used in the Map file .
this setting is needed , because GM provides that one keyboard , that gets a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der Event with the value 40@@ 96 to be able to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some key@@ boards by two sounds up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you &apos;ll need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the Settings menu , Point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this piano , you see what sounds are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t look green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the canal view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view the menu settings below the point of view : settings
the pace LCD displays speed , which is played a song . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the temp@@ o of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the temp@@ o , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music needs to be played . it contains the same MIDI file to two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer ; you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control of everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support has been compiled . to download the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s &apos; )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
in advance , activate the automatic setting for the collection . otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can get the arrow key left from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I &apos;ve played on a &amp; K@@ DE ; Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; in this mode I have to play a MIDI file ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , merely go into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file only if you want to add one to a collection , turn off the setting automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will add to the temporary collection . open from files
let us assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you want to play the first file . so make the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains just this one MIDI file .
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have been sent to me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , animated me to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ rest@@ o ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of leisure for my hobbies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hobbies , but I try to show program MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really don &apos;t want to send me a postcard from your residence or a Mi@@ di@@ - / karaoke file from a local group . all of whom you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to record a MIDI file , but you should contact me as I already have the file .
I have posted &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get tired of money . I would like to empha@@ size that I &apos;m only so re@@ progra@@ me because / when I get back feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which can be found at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look information and see images . you can also find links to pages with other karaoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; comp@@ ile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error correction directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that is displayed if information is displayed in it .
it is possible to en@@ rich the preferred connections under the menu Book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category Dur@@ able play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ archi@@ es . if you have a record , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category , and reproduction starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if you click on a name in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player ; to select from the menu view and next edit mode . by adding a sub@@ group , the XML content is displayed only .
after changing XML files , it must be selected from the menu with play@@ list and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes have lost , if the edit mode or another group will be selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation for starting and moving may be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; general Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can easily be inserted .
it is also possible to activate any other animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / exc@@ ite / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation for Star@@ ts do not need to be short , it will automatically be completed by opening a different source . however , this would be distur@@ bing in the end of animation , but the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be a favorite photo animation : &amp; lt ; sm@@ ells ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; in the source : / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bl@@ es@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of M@@ Player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example of how a flash card using the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages must play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash to the configuration dialog file of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consol@@ es application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module . if no error occurs , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console out of the context menu ) .
this is always an excellent back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime Type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on to play all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play on TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be used on the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog to use in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ video port . there should be detected , of which one is selected ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB to it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player only can use X@@ video , X@@ video should work also ( probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux ) is also supported . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux needs to be functioning for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must therefore be contained in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources used by K@@ M@@ Player . at the time of origin of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ el , source @-@ source , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start with the play@@ list .
can there be indications how to make my CD@@ ROM drive down , if I play from him ( not at VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after connecting the device . definitely sure to make / dev / c@@ drom to the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why must my CPU be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interface and network support and is needed for comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional capture application . under Unix @-@ like systems probably will be used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution package . for installation , the distribution and installation disc should be attracted ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ha@@ ste ; web site .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; or &amp; Linux ;
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , any suggestions about the documentation is taken into account . if the support for this project or the documentation is required , the contact was to be made via the k@@ ha@@ ste ; web site .
if you have any questions or to comp@@ ile &amp; ha@@ ste ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility of using all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the possibility to complete , comp@@ ile , editing and error tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .

if there is only a good night view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to do . by &amp; lat@@ ex ; it should be correct , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W.

just like other signs , contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; a introduction to which the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , aspect ratio and text field are defined as well as a kitchen with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ &apos; document } and needs to be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the high @-@ speed assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a major feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; ha@@ ste ; the selection of the assistant ( menus ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . there are also some examples of the document related settings .
document classes : this is used to specify the type of document calculation : article ( article ) , Book &#91; Report &#93; , article &#91; Report &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , films &#91; Be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this is adjusted the character encoding . modern systems should increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary , UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list includes the usually used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they only be used in the check@@ box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find the compilation of German texts .
new users now don &apos;t worry about any concerns . it is a brief description of the functions and further information in this section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the correct ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , there is a simple way to find out that any mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it will be noticed by the humble appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the high@@ lighting time and r@@ ushing .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; s command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically create a blank line ( for example \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encourage the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most important and sub@@ mar@@ tial element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click on the respective variety .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ many file format &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the respective row in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format of the format and also other information , such as the font , or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example , there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and systems .
when using the root search , the elements of the DVI ; file with the editor of the PFT and once upon a element in the DVI ; source code spec@@ ulation . the pre@@ mise is the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , becomes the appropriate spot in the DVI ; -@@ viewer inj@@ ected .
Master @-@ Document : this feature will be used with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other input .@@ tex files simplified . in the use of a project , a project @-@ wide master @-@ document can be set to project settings .
quick construction : the lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; file sharing : in this mode the DVI ; file on the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wel@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means and there is no call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the editing tool@@ bar the three major components should be developed . the selection box is designed for the rapid support of common elements into the document . the first selection box is designed for the rapid differentiation of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The lat@@ ex &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box for further products is available for items such as tags , joints , notes , or references . the possibilities offered are :
name : this command will create a section for a section , a picture or a different element .
regarding : is used for reference to a fixed label ( select a selection box ) .
when using quote is displayed a select list with literary entries . for the editing &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã Â¶ mer@@ e is used for the establishment of the Scrip@@ tures . it can be specified for the main text , the fu@@ ther notes etc . , there are the following font names :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection options for making a new document by selecting the document art and proc@@ laim@@ ing settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason of this document .
the bra@@ ckets on the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; lays down the fon@@ ts of the font . if the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex has to be compiled ; source code compiled . the easiest way to use is the use of the menu or the drop of the button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ ile . &amp; tile ; for storing the storage automatically .
if the comp@@ ile of the document fails , should be searched in the log@@ ging according to errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should be considered .
a environment ( in English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the Scrip@@ tures should have been addressed . the command \ \ &apos; s { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } are also encouraged to maintain the per@@ sist@@ ence of the font within the environment .
the objec@@ tions are defined only within the environment ( of \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restrictions ( number ) for sub@@ divisions within a environment .
there are many possibilities for the liter@@ acy of the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , ital@@ ics , sub@@ st@@ esses , etc are added to the end of the environment , either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; \ \ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emp@@ h } : this command is available for the course of the course until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word } &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ &apos; s { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; sign language is presented , then a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ha@@ ste ; .
once in the assistant , a bit text has been entered , a few adjust@@ ments should be performed for better legi@@ bility of the document . at this time , a quot@@ ation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem for use are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor &apos;s view or C@@ tr@@ l e can be returned to the editor by editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E . at an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simple try and have fun .
DVI ; is a large file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ ered ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer monitors .
for printing one &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - you can then print the document ( in the viewer ) , then the printer can be printed correctly ( if the printer is correctly set ) .
the tool encour@@ ages the transformation of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion can start to any other formats using the Kn@@ Ã Â¶ P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar .
the for@@ warding search encour@@ ages direct jump from the editor to add one position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding attitude for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ binary files . only Modern at@@ titudes are set up with at@@ ile ... tools B@@ auen .
to search for the pre@@ ferences , the mouse po@@ inter has to be positioned in a line of the source code and close to pre@@ mise . the jump to the respective spot in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the medium mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; file by &amp; k@@ ile ; used and spec@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor should be set ( Settings ... Editor )
if using quick @-@ building the &amp; DVI ; viewer can not be mentioned , an error may be prec@@ eded . if a mistake is required , this will be displayed in the log file , or in the message window .
the log@@ ging file provides the source source in the source code . in the editor , then the Kn@@ Ã Â¶ P@@ FO@@ X error and N@@ Ã Â¼ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error has to be used in the error . in order to consider in@@ correct line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging and ha@@ ste ; jumps to in@@ correct line .
once you cli@@ cked on the matching button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template &apos;s choice for the document . the most default mapping are :
selecting the empty document a document may be used either by reason or the wi@@ zard for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section .
for example users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be generated or a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by means of an existing document and choose from the template &apos;s template .
when creating a new document of a template , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in at@@ titudes of tile ... settings in general .
for creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables will be replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ O@@ PT@@ I@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically they will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ SS@@ O@@ PT@@ I@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to creating a template is the use of the assistant and that makes use of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created on this way , the following steps will be accomplished :
when creating a new document , the template can be selected instead of the standard char@@ ms .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched , according to one in the Internet , and the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; uses &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about Kate &apos;s and Kate , the Hand@@ book to Kate will be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can be addressed directly with the editor of &amp; Kate &apos;s editor .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called for the menu of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use them as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click @-@ click C@@ tr@@ l button to remove the &amp; tex ; word for cooling . this means that this means when clicking on the \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
when pulling the text , with the lined lin@@ ker , the full text will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys , you can find parts of the source code on the editing window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source codes and empha@@ size this . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants like to collect dive marks . this is a number of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entry is highlighted the leap to n@@ ett@@ est or last jumping brand . this dive is also highlighted in the first entry of a drawing automatically .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source material added . &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing are the following commands to add text selection :
does a complete paragraph ( group of lines contained on both sides ) . this extended meaning is meant for tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only clear thing in &amp; k@@ ha@@ ste ; it is therefore that the down@@ fall is separated by two blank lines .
in case of the current cur@@ sor position , this is also an enlarged meaning , since this command also contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a r@@ ins@@ ulated star ( \ \ ) and a added star ( * ) at the end .
for sharing a part of the document can be removed from this first and can be removed by pressing the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the key collection of C@@ tr@@ l ; K with the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands for a faster application . under editing , the following commands are available at the text of the text :
remove a complete section . the definition of a section in &amp; k@@ ha@@ ste ; is included in the description of editing cooling sales .
it has already been clear that environments can play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under the editing environment for a very simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is spec@@ kled in the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the command .
this command is inj@@ ected to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor or within the command \ \ &apos; s { surrounding } is located at the end of the surrounding area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering the input of many contam@@ inated environment commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command is close to the last setting , so that the lac@@ ed environment structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are destined for bra@@ ckets { ... } . edit Te@@ X Group are a few important commands that comply with those from editing environment .
with this command , the current group is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the welded bracket .
with this command , the current group is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor will be placed directly behind the welded bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # is inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many emb@@ ell@@ ished groups @-@ bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly . this command will close the last group , so that the we@@ aned structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be dist@@ orted .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple starting signs are used . for the purpose of the purpose , the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign will be used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two close directions for a lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic setting can set up the double starting point under at@@ titudes of tile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and will be used .
there are also other specific settings ( such as n@@ olls or French ) and that in order to be used German or French positions . there are also many other languages available .
for shift from shift ; ONE G@@ AB@@ ET@@ AST@@ E for &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent cell breaks . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e. g. parade or it@@ em@@ ize ) , there is not only one line breaks but simultaneously the command \ \ item .
close within a tables environment , double &amp; tile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ are starting with a decent line breaks .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to empha@@ size pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . to set up this box under at@@ titudes ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables @-@ environments and all the em@@ ile characters ( amp ; ) to arrange each other . if this tab@@ ulator is not possible , for example , if this tab@@ ulator is not added , however , to add &amp; k@@ ile ; there is some inter@@ room for the columns to the current tab@@ s .
although &amp; Kate has already expanded a good source code , these are in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to have special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) yet , there are three different modes as needed and the other two are available for automatic shift settings . all these modes are set up for different work@@ places under at@@ titudes of tile ... Res@@ ur@@ able .
when you start a new environment using the \ \ &apos; s { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surrounding } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when turning the button bar , the last letter of entry is removed and can be inn@@ ed to the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also reduce the list by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be found in a selection of a command . alternatively , there is also a jump to these positions via Edit jump marks , denom@@ inated , and the desired parameters can be folded then .
under at@@ titudes are ha@@ ste ; set up ... chew@@ ing ; full@@ size settings for these lists . it can be used different scale lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as calf for the general language used .
the command mode is not available for use of environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ &apos; . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; create a special mode for fully operational environments .
when calling the process mode , the reference mode or the keyboard is Alt + Shift key , the command will begin automatically and it appears \ \ &apos; s . afterwards , the environment will be carried out on the easiest way and can be terminated by using the input button .
after having completed this , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile , recogni@@ zes that it is a lists environment , will even be a first \ \ item command with one &apos;s first \ item command .
under at@@ titudes ile ; set up ... chew@@ ing ; file settings for these lists . this mode uses the file list of the complete set mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; empha@@ size custom lists of ab@@ rup@@ tions , which are set up immediately by l@@ apping character strings . as an example , the lists use ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and replaced by the word processor mode , or the key ( C@@ tr@@ l + old space bar ) , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large number of washing machines are not helpful for the automatic failure . however , it has been determined that many boards have been written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile provides the full service for all of them already written .
this mode can set up in the quantity settings ... K@@ ile over@@ lay down . here , the swelling can be specified for the display of the calculation .
the installation files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / the par@@ quet home folder . fashion is there for mar@@ c@@ ination ( etching ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã Â¶ r@@ ter@@ led@@ ger ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed , designed for graphics , just as simple as possible . to the view of the basics on the graphic data , the sections should be noted and respected .
PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ direc@@ tives of pages . if the PDF output is added , the pages are arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re @-@ arranged and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to look forward to the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus for creating comp@@ ile , creating converting and creating views .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be converted to the keyboard by old ; 3 viewed , by old ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file , and by Alt ; 5 the PS file is considered .
when using the command quick@@ set , a viewer is usually called to comp@@ ile after comp@@ iling . if no one @-@ bound viewer should be used , every time a new window will be used .
a new project will continue to project new project .... In the following information , the project will be questioned about the project :
when using the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the output of EC@@ CLE@@ cript code . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical box .
the API scripts are not yet developed yet , and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first , first must be said that the distribution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite pronounced system , in which the basic functions are expanded by a variety of shared packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of varied assistance to the user &apos;s support .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; they are delivered with many documents . there is a documentation for the packages contained and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete Ref@@ ern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ at@@ oms are not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the search for a specific form@@ att@@ ing . as it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ha@@ ste ; in three important book@@ marks are divided .
because of the quantity of documents with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / lyrics live ; finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and herein a graphical user area .
all documents are divided into categories , and the larger advantage is the search for packages name or impact w@@ anders . by &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click of the mouse or the space of space @-@ button check the viewer for the document .

the plug@@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even though , have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can benefit from the extra functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone can use the t@@ apped in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used further below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start with the plug@@ ins plug@@ ins . this gives the following dialog :
this dialogue enables to manage all of the contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search path . adding plug@@ ins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search of plug@@ ins .
often work on one project several people work in a sort of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with SH@@ IFT ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the user name of user and serves for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can look for yourself from the list of Team Members who it is . this is done by pressing the team member of the list and the button S@@ etze is pressing . currently selected member ( their identification ) appears fat after you are : text .
nickname and setting of their own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by the members of the team : it can be created an event for information about the team manager if something happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens , so that later it can be seen , how much someone worked on it or if a file is secured , or a script which will enter a file into CV@@ S as soon as they are added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alog@@ es can be created , processed and deleted .
an email will be sent to the mailing list selected in the recipient list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project leaders . see in as such leaders will be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes are simple . it can be selected either from editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary area followed by text @-@ text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , the nickname of the division &apos;s nickname : team leader , head @-@ project leaders , according to the enrich@@ ing and sub @-@ project leaders should be cited , such as in the examples below .
nickname and roll@@ ers @-@ names are independent of large or small @-@ size , but spaces for the cl@@ as@@ ps and the : make the note inv@@ alid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the DT@@ D @-@ type and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scrip@@ ting languages supported .
the settings are accessed via the Settings menu . only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for others can be found in .
the settings can set up by settings Qu@@ ant@@ a ... called . this dialog extends over a few pages that will be treated each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including cars , may be changed . entries are :
big / Sm@@ all@@ ure of tags : large / small incl@@ ination of automatically added tags . normal wholesale / small incl@@ ination means , tags will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
great / Small attribute of attributes : large / small incl@@ ination of automatically added attributes . normal wholesale / small incl@@ ination means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if attached , is optional for tags , which is optional on the closing day , navigating immediately to the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above all other tags , except for simple tags .
start and departure day automatically : if enabled , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic transformation of acute characters in the corresponding co@@ ils during the typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ ing types for det@@ ecting different types of files . using button standard , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in another way as with file opening open files ( where the coding of the file can be negotiated ) . however , this attitude will be extended from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this attitude will be extended by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates regularly backup copies , so that in a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , this is not the same as the saving of the file . also for even stored documents , a backup will regularly be created , according to the set time created .
the preview of the documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or a separate view ( or documentation in a cart@@ on ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
set the window settings next to the next start is useful when the user interface passes through alter@@ ation of M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command parameter .
the warning messages area serves the tax of the possibility to en@@ force war@@ nings from no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can see the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code in shared mode . regarding the different modes , see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the image of the par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the field of mouse click on the structure @-@ tree , the following action is possible to change the action @-@ dissolved action by clicking the structure of the mouse button .
in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree is open automatically . empty knots are to be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups are found , in which there is no element in the current document .
the range for fixed abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in editing for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; it means it may have a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ cl@@ ause means something different means as in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript .
here the plug @-@ ins are managed . plug @-@ ins are part of the third page , which can be used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following must be stated :
address : the path to Plu@@ gin , if it is not located on a stand like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project ord@@ ner .
component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : verify that plug@@ in is ref@@ using to store . only @-@ l@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse to store if this option is not selected .
check the Plu@@ gin : is this activ@@ ates , then testing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the specified information is correct . if the plug@@ in is not available , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bug@@ gers have been implemented , as well as the support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations of plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
the use of the de@@ bug@@ gers for a project begins with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . using the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
a view in which the content of monit@@ orable variables is displayed . usually in the left dock .
a view , in which all gri@@ ps points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually in the lower dock .
a view to which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bug is usually displayed at the bottom do@@ ck .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bug@@ gers , anything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plug@@ in with to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ claims . this action is being opened by default , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger is used , so that in the normal circumstances must not be respected .
the meeting at the Deb@@ ug@@ ger session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or to the requirements .
sends a HTTP requirement to a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
points to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to begin with the execution of the script and the current line continuously . if this happens when the script is continued , the execution will be continued . if this happens , the script starts with the requirement .
points to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without sending information on the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is given , the execution starts , the execution will start as soon as a requirement is provided .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger introduces the next directive in the script , without going into the features or includes .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to get better .
documentation type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; abilities to provide support for mark@@ ers and scripts . its simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bars . day folder includes two file types , die &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ ging files are handwritten , symbolic glu@@ es of pic@@ ks ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions qu@@ icker into a document when a user might ever be .
&amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created simultaneously ( see below ) , downloaded , or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see details for details .
this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . briefly , an &amp; DT@@ EP .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ di@@ alog@@ es , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; itself . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of writing .
tag file are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag file bear the name of the descri@@ p@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not all necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible , so that other users have better viewing and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and limitations will be presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can only be found in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but only element type over itself .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; a function of function . ( family 2 )
valid only for the day class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( family 2 )
valid only for the Type Method . gives the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute and the attributes can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . that &apos;s a only element type element .
describes a attribute of a tags . this element may only be for each attribute . it contains the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags that should be shown as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element -@@ type element .
is the source codes used for the attributes in the day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog , and the attribute @-@ tree in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface is used within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is used for reaching the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . d@@ co@@ p methodology name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a methodology name . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % day name % , that means the name of the current tags .
one container tag contained the elements of a list together . it can only happen for an attribute description only once . it is a only element element .
speci@@ fies the position of attribute tex@@ tures a tags within a dialogue . this day can only be found for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and the size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
gives a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ased and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to review the tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to launch and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the verification only takes place at the store of the Tag@@ XML @-@ files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
in the following an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; file name . the file name for this tag@@ XML file is supposed to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Excel feature is described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; type = &quot; class &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just quite simple and there is an editor to be re@@ achable via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings . therefore , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = turn@@ around 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D @-@ indication ( / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can set up with at@@ titudes of actions ... click on New Action to the same dialogue :
this action is assigned to the abbrevi@@ ation button . with clicking the button user you can be assigned a key@@ note ; with K@@ one the current button is removable .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into a text in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see example below .
this is the most powerful action type . using the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of document ) , even are the quick start @-@ up dialog or the various look in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ EPs .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed to use the % scrip@@ t@@ ance variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ ance / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable to be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced by the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file name : / from the document name is removed .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process is replaced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is useful when D@@ COP is used to control the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by external script .
parameters for this event , normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us can be accepted at default . in the selection box , it can be determined to send the default entry . options are :
selected text : the selected area of document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful only with this attitude .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can be re@@ directed . there are two types issue : normal edition , written on the standard issue , error messages , which should be specified in accordance with the default text written , by setting the value of the selection box :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar .
complete everything and , if the day &apos;s attributes has and you are planning to re @-@ activate the dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , so that an input of using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should mem@@ ori@@ ze the action with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action is better represents , we will use &amp; k@@ ett@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics and other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ ett@@ edit ; used by default , 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select another size .
please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; .
with regard to that the day start , means , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled , that click on this symbol to insert a message ; -@@ Day in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be linked to the action . this happens via the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder , where the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , so it is still which , or do you confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to the tool@@ bar , or if it should be added to a better overview by some separ@@ ator in several groups . open the tool@@ bars to set up the tool@@ bars , make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( right up ) for my tool@@ bar . after choosing the element , that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick opportunity to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner does not know the group@@ ing . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; kno@@ b the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by means of all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
back up in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bars ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adapt their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded , if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user you can add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory if anyone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is left to you , the second we treat you here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Doc@@ umentation 1 = $ 1.@@ html , 2 = $ 2.@@ html tag@@ on , tag@@ 2 = tag@@ s.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ s.@@ html tag@@ 3
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in PHP &apos;s &amp; PHP ; documentation is something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = tri@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no well @-@ known border to the chess yeast ( except the reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents will be refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the top end of the construction manager &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; file is shown ! ) .
spaces affecting nothing , but make sure &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eries will be replaced .
the content segment is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which should be shown to design of context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file binding lines .
a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and save up to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / doc for local or global usage . then create a folder ( such as you do this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that these good and well worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. , which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud of being involved in the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the res@@ sources of resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else . at different sites there is an email sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script &apos;s tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ users can be downloaded and only made available if our team need them to make use of the resources , where it ensures a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked by your Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have several keys to pass . in the dialogue New resource may remain blank ( URL preview can remain empty ) and then click OK the up@@ loading .
upload the upload of the menu DT@@ D DT@@ D ( DT@@ EP ) to upload , upload , tool@@ bars , and folders in the templates and scripts in the templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , before the installation , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource is investigated . in the case of problems , it can be broken . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed , a message appears with the description of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , it may be time consuming , because hundreds of tag files can be necessary in the tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a DT@@ EP package .
conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and convert a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description that should be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folders .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ i@@ tive line : the string that should appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of DT@@ EP after conversion : if enabled , sp@@ it &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; Editor , with details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this chapter attempts to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; few benefits .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project involved . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses , available . by factory monitoring , everything is marked as globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administr@@ ators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be done all by &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns of up to tool bar with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simple , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ ment , the Bau@@ man@@ ners , the boxes , and the tool@@ bars . please strike in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , like close the current , other or all boxes , re@@ load , er@@ ase or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
legal click in the Edi@@ tor@@ ch section will lead to a further context menu regarding the appropriate document content ( cut / copy / paste / paste ) , editing the file name , or open the file , if the string can appear under the mouse pointing one file .
at the top of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Transi@@ tional as a standard , for which one set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars of the new functions are adapted to the new features and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , then click the icon , which is represented the day . now , you can add the data for this just one day . if you want to add a day that several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can add in a dialogue different fields .
the construction site ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate to navigate them and pass through . in the presentation of boxes , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation constructions are available .
project management is a powerful tool to provide &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload , or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all possibilities open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working range . global Templ@@ ates are always available , local templates for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as the script , edit or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of a element , the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of a element , a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among other construction sites . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change . this is possible to change the change of all available attributes with a few mouse cli@@ cks .
here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development . it can be downloaded from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can create own documentation , and add a folder doc to a project can be edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two box tra@@ ilers at the bottom of the window can be achieved : the news window and the problem window .
this box shows information about each in Qu@@ ant@@ a running script . for example , the DT@@ D of the current document and all modifications to DT@@ D are shown .
this box shows all errors in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the tool@@ bar is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool bar as a compressed t@@ ar @-@ archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they get a tool@@ bar in an email , you can back up and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file files to your system . for this , auto@@ conf has given a number of options to get to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of all the options , type . / configure --@@ help . options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with star@@ ters of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check whether your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin file also . you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H is present in front of her bin . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful features .
while effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able Mark@@ up languages ? well , this would make him an absolutely amazing web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; restricted , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then you should use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
well , to the af@@ ore@@ mentioned requirement must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the total &amp; K@@ DE ; the idea of why does someone developed ? thanks to &amp; K@@ DE ; it is not only possible to expand , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web development to increase the utili@@ zation of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity almost every task . by the program comm@@ otion , they &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; expand without any one script language skills to do . ( more on this you can find in . )
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; Plus is available in any way with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in detailed documentation is with help : / qu@@ ant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run @-@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ ant@@ a run ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for the later use . check in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template &apos;s stock , only one error reported .
conver@@ ts special signs for the cli@@ p@@ board there , contained special signs for the &amp; HTML ; -@@ note , so that it is properly displayed and cannot be understood from the browser as form@@ att@@ ing .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ dial , which is the correct way to add special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first line to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the block selection or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
seek a string or regular expression in selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or used combination with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions in order to help you .
shows the message window . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bug@@ gers .
- and switch @-@ up of the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the problem of the problem is activated once you changes to the structural tree .
shows the symbol left from the main window . this column allows you to set Book@@ mark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries predicted or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the men@@ tioning after the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . that enables you to copy video files into your project ord@@ ner or a sub@@ folder , then add it to the project .
downloads the files in your project on server . the list of available transport methods depend on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves ) .
at@@ titudes , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you find the details .
invites a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialogue to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set up using settings . tool@@ bars are stored in the tool@@ bars of the tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the visual field . del@@ etes it not from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar still not stored , you will be asked if you want to do this .
you can send their own tool bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu entry opens up a new email message with tool bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool bar to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone has made someone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / un@@ loading the en@@ typ@@ ing from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the du@@ ti@@ tes from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to re@@ fresh , without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this globally is not present and a typ@@ i@@ ration in the global K@@ DE @-@ file is not available , loading the loading .
this menu includes a list of tags that are currently loaded into the currently loaded factory settings . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day evaluation dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ men@@ tions .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . at present , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , inser@@ ts the inser@@ tion by tool bar if this day is contra@@ dic@@ ated by the rules on this place .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ in menu are listed below . click on . click on activated plug@@ ins disabled .
cho@@ oses the current file mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the makes ; -@@ version .
cho@@ oses the type of line identification . very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by the external use Ti@@ dy .
immediate changes between different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , changes sometimes need or create un@@ clear graphics . recommended is the box mode , which is also the default setting , or the under@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open under@@ window . with a selection of a contract , the corresponding sub@@ routine will be activated .
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main f@@ rank and respectively .
the changes in this dialogue will affect any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
addresses the behavior of the Edi@@ tor@@ f@@ enst@@ ers . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialogue appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which add sequences and sequences .
this should create a help in the context of the mouse pointing device , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but like with any open source project , developers always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; they will find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out at the top of the project , for example , after filling the project named the entire directory structure for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information can be changed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine , which one wants to access , one unless edited local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , default settings of the chosen log might be used . depending on the setting of the remote machine , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to project and by default templates . if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of the standard .
this is the folder to be saved in the tool@@ bars for the project . it is a relative path to project and standard tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files used for various projects should be set to this folder instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from local file system into the project . several files or whole folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you want to download static content you would like to download and change . in vers@@ ari@@ ous scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
def@@ aul@@ ts , if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be integrated . if a project is started upon new , not an@@ ha@@ ke .
with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can imagine a precise choice of good th@@ inner .
this shows a list of files in the main file . you can select the desired files through An@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the ha@@ unted , out of the project .
the latest screen assistant of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be able to upload your work in the menu window in the menu window , or with the button Shift + Shift : F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) , which are re @-@ read in projects such as project ord@@ ner .
comple@@ mentary option to above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which will be loaded with the opening of the project , can be read more about projections views .
this allows you to select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . at present , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be set with the options options . in this case the bug hunting is described .
in the under@@ window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , showing po@@ inter a separate building view for each profile .
in the under@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the under@@ window event configuration , one can un@@ lock event actions and add these actions , change or delete this actions . event transactions will be executed if a certain event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see details in the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not influence currently .
to open a different project , open the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project , open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files when you load a new project .
the project management features free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
ste@@ wards behave in the same way , however , the entries are missing and open ... in conjunction with the right mouse button menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the site of uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only longer a profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removing removing the removal .
password will retain and forget about programming . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ afe password to save files can &apos;t be found in question .
this will stop the transmission , or leave the dialogue , if you change your opinion in front of the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be uploaded and therefore the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to various servers . in editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the plate , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but each with programm@@ ers can easily be seen in plain text .
a projec@@ ting view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded into a project many views , i.e. by simple di@@ pping of the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the current opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings of the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own work mode .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best about the menu tool@@ bar . use and adding different . adding of tool@@ bars below is treated below in the section of tool@@ bars below .
the tool bar and symbols can be set out either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , you can remove any other actions such as tool@@ bars , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in the dialogue , where to be stated , which actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu on an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition , the entries will be removed and action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with at@@ titudes of tool@@ bars ... and setting actions set .
templates are contained in essential document@@ ing , code escal@@ op@@ es and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates such as a common file system with ext@@ end@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , shift or connected any of the system existing directory in the storage space . templates are available in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you intended for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted into any file unless text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are normally inserted in documents by links ( such as pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the pre @-@ stock room under global templates . further information on the Templ@@ ate tree is available in .
documents can be compiled by any text document type . on the basis of this templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficient . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ stock room under global templates . see for more information on the Templ@@ ates tree .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted into documents , but the same text area should be inserted into documents . you can find everything from a comment via a final table to be found on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl base . see some examples in the pre @-@ stock room at global templates . see in for more information on the Templ@@ ates tree .
as the name says , these templates are intended for all sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents arranged in a folder in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
design a document structure according to plat@@ ter ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As a template as a local template . save ...
once this has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . watch in the pre @-@ stock room under project templates .
select text in your document and click on the template as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged along with pulling and slip onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only into a board folder . you can use all file management functions , such as pulling and paste or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click in the file tree or in the project files building view on a folder right click and secure a name for the template . by default , it can be saved in the project ord@@ ner , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project pre@@ positions allow a highly oriented approach . you can submit head@@ lines and foot@@ er lines or link dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link with them . additionally , you can keep some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the under@@ window templates is based on the files created in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ ant@@ a / templates . each of this folder is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to determine the behavior of a folder , click on the folder with the right mouse button and select the properties menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed , as soon as El@@ ter@@ most attributes is disgu@@ ised .
this is enabled by default and adapted for everything except ordinary folders . if a trunk file had been set in principle , it would be activated in this path , unless they would be explic@@ it . in case of normal folder would appear , it would probably appear in a regular folder . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a regular folder .
allows you or posted text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ line or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to out@@ fit a whole presentation to the appropriate head @-@ line / foot@@ er lines .
additionally , you have to add context menu ( to show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be accessed via the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second file divi@@ des the editing window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch on if necessary modifications to the source code editor , in which the source code is visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; file to a document , which includes PHP ; source text indicates a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ens@@ ein of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is necessary to edit the source code . there are no plans to change these behavi@@ ours .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and the cur@@ sor in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously , this mode is already active , removes the pressure signal to the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ ant@@ a .... It can be set between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically select the period of time . basically the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing properties is also possible with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this is why you can change the following :
met@@ a tags permit the storage of information about the document itself e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click on the list allows change of content , such as key words on the column names and keyword key wor@@ d@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add CSS rules on the list below or delete . a change about the list is possible , just like the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules are currently not supported .
it is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is like in a word processor , due to moving with arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor position is distinctive as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing or button @-@ button or reset button .
the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way above the tool bar , as in the source editor , it is obvious that the inser@@ tion of tags has already been inserted , e.g. an anchor day , surround with text , must be removed every other surrounding anchor day .
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the lists are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to work in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion , the search for certain elements are possible and the execution of style may be persecuted .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ sl@@ d@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , except &amp; K@@ DE ; still use lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE .

in this command , you will be checked on a partial or entire match with a pre@@ age called my@@ ME or a specified module name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ ME , which contains the string template .
any nam@@ esp@@ ace within the specified &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; will be added according to rules defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ sl : test@@ 1 is expanded ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / trans@@ forms : test@@ 1

if the command &quot; search &quot; will be executed , a x@@ ml file called search@@ able .x@@ ml is created . this file can then be edited with a custom @-@ defined style template to present the data in different form , If the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means html &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the file search@@ result will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on systems with installed Read@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to / from the run memory of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to put together expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; set .

there are many graphical tools for compar@@ isons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the entries in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts with merge .
the program used by me knew only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed in these lines . and there was no evidence in the places where the change had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and modifications to white signs . later , lots of other useful functions were added .
if you want to compare the text quickly , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and app@@ end it in one of the compar@@ ative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently apart from one piece of code and changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to process the outcome . in this editor you can even edit the results directly . the screenshot shows three source files to merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you the same and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; perform in the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and can be adjusted the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if lines only differ in certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary of the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if no one changes the entry . )
if one file is equal , and the other is different in one line , the colour indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different .
if all files are the same name , but in different folder , then you can simpli@@ fy the typ@@ ing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder , folder 1 folder , folder 1 folder , folder 1 folder , folder 3 folder
open dialog allows manual integration of file names , select the selection above the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last edit file from the listing file . the open dialog can indicate the next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you have the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merge of folders will be selected for B and C , however , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; file name from A in both other folders .
when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active for target and is not necessarily required to specify an output file . you can also save this step further when saving .
the setting button opens up a dialog with at@@ titudes . here you can specify options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text box . the comparison begins immediately . in open dialogue , you don &apos;t need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the kno@@ b button .
you can also use pulling and drag them : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes contains a file , e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar functions are , it would only be a relatively big effort . you would only need to download two corresponding files , to add them to &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can copy the relevant sections easily , insert and then compare .
note : there you can do nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the f@@ law can be supported in a comparison window .
warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the pulling and copy of text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text box there is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line includes the sign A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that windows are optional ) , leave the mouse to rest about the line . then a small relief window will show the whole name . )
the three sources are the letters A , B and C . A has the colour blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees the colour which file differs . if both files are different , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
left next to the text is the summar@@ ization column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the colour is not so important to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. , white signs are only in character strings and comments , relevant for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the summary column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line is activated , the line is represented in broken lines .
the results window ( under the comparison list ) also has an information line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons on the next dissolved / un@@ used conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ isons are used , each difference is to be solved simultaneously , a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group &apos;s first line is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also appear a jump in the window in the window , where the group will appear in the background . ) This group becomes highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes it remains through the automatic merge or through manual processing no further line more in the group ; it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you will change your opinion and perhaps choose another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking which you might copy and paste something different .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the results window . be careful with this function .
note : when choosing the sources , select the options to ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs .
navigate primarily with the image running and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you &apos;re in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys to the right , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ beginning and tr@@ l @-@ end , si@@ f as you can also use it from other programs here .
in the eye window you can also use the other buttons to edit mode . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and transfer mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ized columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the context of merge and editing window ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g picture downhill ) or the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upwards / Str@@ g picture downhill ) or the next / previous conflict . therefore , all non @-@ sol@@ dered conflicts are still considered a conflict . therefore there must be a distinction between deleted and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ insert ) . if enabled , will be automatically copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board and manually . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are stored in accordance with the basic operating system . UNIX and Win32 @-@ based systems use chari@@ ot @-@ return + c@@ ab cables \ \ \ \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the source files for use , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and list of last used files will be automatically stored and re @-@ established at the next start ( menu adju@@ sting - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialogue also provides writings with variable width , you should not use them . )
when you turn this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen scrip@@ ture does not support this display , nothing happens .
systems with only 16 or 256 colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered automatically . on these systems the button settings will automatically display an odd colour .
if this option is enabled , a tab@@ ulator sign will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign will be inserted .
when you enter or press return , the setting of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board . manual copying into the cli@@ p@@ board then falls .
you can select which tick @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the common choice on the operating system used .
when changing files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during the first step can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es any line . in this step , white signs will not ignore . even when mer@@ ging , white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a car tra@@ d &apos; \ &apos; ends at the end of one line , but then you could only look up with different sizes in the page @-@ on @-@ side comparison , but then you might be different . when this option is activated , this option must be de@@ activated . in default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analyses , numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; ) ignored . however , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively still looking for smaller differences . the option is activated in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
the automatic res@@ p mode determines this setting , as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next inv@@ alid conflict will continue .
dis@@ sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are used in many files , then take advantage of the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are able to ignore it or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in chapter on scanning by folders and de@@ duction of a mer@@ ging . look for details below document@@ ing to the directory @-@ comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , then the original version will be added , then the original version will be added with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original , it will be deleted without further backup .
fits the language of user interface . this option does not apply to current running program . you need to end &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; finish and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set to the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set to control over the control centre . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if using this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
regarding the selection fields for encoding appears a short note , what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and merged with different encoding .
if you have edited a file , you can define what encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you may not have to function with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can handle 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the processing command can only be set with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the coding of the output commands .
switch off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are logged or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour@@ fully coded transition column . but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files . after choosing A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal even a second transition column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . keep out the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the compar@@ isons next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for viewing of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . current file merge together . a simple click starts up the merge menu as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart inter@@ actions , then the name of the last used output file is retained . )
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your requirements . for example , you can use this function for example , or to correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is passed to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is given the input commands . you can only write your own pre@@ processor , which is exactly your requirements . each input line must have a related issue @-@ line .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program itself . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases , sed or per@@ l perfectly sufficient .
use this prec@@ ep@@ tive command to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ conver@@ ts the folded text in capital letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some key words to include files ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experim@@ ented with sed experim@@ entation , you may be able to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar items .
the Ig@@ nor@@ ms of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another prec@@ ep@@ tive command for c@@ turn@@ tables . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every characters between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a matches , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several consider@@ ations at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the proceeds from each other . example :
instead of sed , you can also need something different such as per@@ l -@@ p @-@ e &apos; s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; However , for per@@ l some details are different . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processors are maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the further operations change only the data , which sees the line @-@ like Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line processor will see the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but , as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences in the worst case important data .
often you need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ itali@@ c .
... make a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without it really ,
... leads to selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or just with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you only need to specify folders on command line or in the file file .
if there are three folders , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was specified , it uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not merge the merge , select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
during the folder the folder inform@@ s you a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed , which have been compared until then .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list with the results on the left , ...
every file and any file that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can click on the + / - click or click on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory contains two functions of the sub@@ directories and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can upgrade all the folders .
when you click on a file , the file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window on the selected object . in such a case , the merge action can not be automatically chosen . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the above picture .
in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders will be considered identical if its entire content is identical . then , you also have the same color . among folders , the age is un@@ remarkable for its colour .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow is and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. A folder and B one file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B does not have the same file type ( e.g. A folder and B one file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders were given , and if the option is synchron@@ ize , then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , that after a entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user can only be seen as visible file names for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
if two folders will be merged and select the option new file instead of merge ( uncertain ) , then the error message appears . if the files are different , but the date is identical . files are identical , but the date is identical .. While the error is not fixed , the files can &apos;t be started .
during the merge , a file is deduc@@ ted after the other . it status column indicates that when the merge was successful , and according to other messages if something unexpected is completed , you should check out a last review and see if the status is fine .
if in the configuration dialog , the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ itary conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or related . )
you can either run the just selected entry ( file or or@@ aries ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all mer@@ ging actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can launch the coll@@ ision .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then the three @-@ file merge mode C is used as target , in the two @-@ file merge mode , A and / or B is used as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in folder structure , there are some options to be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check out these options to avoid un@@ lov@@ able surprises :
to bring together all entries : select directories together / continue in the directory &quot; menu or press F@@ 7 ( button abbrevi@@ ation ) . to put together the current entry , choose the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if contra@@ dic@@ tory data types still exist un@@ inv@@ alid actions , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you assemble all entries , a dialogue window with the options lead , sim@@ ul@@ ating and ab@@ rupt .
select sim@@ ulate when you want to see what would happen , without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all promotions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; leads then certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window opens ( note the screenshot ) .
if you &apos;re done with a file , choose folders / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , an appropriate dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work goes on with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you fix the cause of the problem . if you have the opportunity to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with merge .
if some entries were individually assembled , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in current session ) and execute them together . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries are taken out as closed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that adjust to the specified patterns are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . separate pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is not to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that will also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this may be specified with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( check under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a batch attribute . in other file systems marked a previous point . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to the links below . this is de@@ activated in the default .
in links to file : if the option is switched off , the links will be addressed and recur@@ sive . ( note that if the option is switched on and recur@@ sive , the links will result in a link which contains a link on itself . ) This option is switched off in default .
execute a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ es , un@@ worn , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding Anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may seem to compare only the date of change and file size . please use caution . this option is activated in the default setting .
similar to confidenti@@ ality of date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical when copying the date of date . please use caution . this option is activated in the default setting .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target file has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are identical . the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences instead of merge the copy of the newer file as an action . ( this will be considered uns@@ afe , because the other file is not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is displayed in default .
if a file or file is replaced by another or delete , then the original version will be renamed , then the extension .@@ orig@@ ines already exists , this will be er@@ ased without another backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of single files , not just the merge full folder . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the file @-@ merge view@@ point is visible from the merge of single files ; you can turn the window divi@@ ding with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can dis@@ able the windows directory in the window menu and switch between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . however , you can also merge a single file directly together without the folder . once you save the result , the status is set to merge and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost , however , if you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders , which are on local or remote networks .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
one URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relatively . or .. contain . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system , sometimes by the protocol , sometimes a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link will display on a file or folder . then a file is accepted as a link @-@ target . ( FTP : , FTP : ) .
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change @-@ date . therefore , per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note this option is possible only with local files . )
the main purpose is currently used as differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts at first always the built @-@ in differences viewer . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the viewer viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if it is used as a part , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names will exist in the Uni@@ fied format . then , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; patch patch is to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports compar@@ ing two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the comparison of folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is Kom@@ fi ) already exist . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 is already pointing out that it can merge the program diff@@ 3 out of the di@@ ff @-@ tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs already very long and have learned a lot while I looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone to this path or are going to be so .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not have the right PRE@@ F@@ IX to K@@ DE . pres@@ et installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . for more information regarding the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only one non @-@ white characters different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines for next to Each other , this is mar@@ gin@@ ally this is more often the case .
the editor does not notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is lost , however , if the result is simply stored as text file , and it &apos;s too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information .
the effort for this was too large . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , it &apos;s suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; appeared and the text doesn &apos;t delete . what does it mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you !
to be able to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage .
a list of last changes will be found at htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file of Ch@@ angel@@ og in the source package .
to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; use the following command in the basic file of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives you the folder in your system where the K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems when comp@@ ile . should still be encountered difficulties , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists .
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or sch@@ sch@@ alt @-@ removing ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or switch @-@ insert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position resp@@ . replace the current marking .
only differences are shown : files are identical in all folders , and therefore not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder on these options )
there are only entries to display the differences . this also causes identical files to merge in the target folder . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing after merge . ( behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is displayed in the default program .
note the buttons for choosing the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button again .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ scores in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , to end their size , to end it or move it . this works both within a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work@@ stations as well as the applications running . the applications can be selected and even can be moved to the desktop and other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both Desktop and other working areas .
the context menu depends where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; but if it was cli@@ cked on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; but if there is also the symbol and the name of the application and the entries to minim@@ ize , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . commands are the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of desktop . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on an application .
sends application to selected virtual Desktop . only appears when an application was cli@@ cked on .
if this cross box is labeled , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed .
this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . it is displayed along with name , the names with ord@@ inal numbers are provided , eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background is displayed as a background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs will appear as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed in order to enable its selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple , simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of real program code . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very rapid systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main lines will be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in some other windows managers are known ; horizontal , all virtual work@@ spaces are present in a horizontal row and per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular in a vertical range , which is very good for the display side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with their content and post@@ p@@ one . also , it runs outside the control bar .
right click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and you can set up sel@@ ector switches ... letting the dialog appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not apply as user root or apply to your system administrator . in this file you need to apply the key wind@@ ow@@ le fashion and apply to this one value . possible values are :
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE Basic package .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen menu . you can read with &amp; k@@ mag ; you can read one part of the screen . this application is interesting for different users : this application includes artists , web designers and people with a tend@@ on . this documentation is to be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag ;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly extended to expand new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
if you like &amp; k@@ ah ; start a window as pictured above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged window of the screen . in the following , this window displays the magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of screen and is referred to as the selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the range around the mouse pointing device as a mobile phone . alternatively , you can set &amp; k@@ mag ; add a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ to mode ) or the environment of the mouse pointing device at the screen ( eg ; on the left ) .
do you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse pointing device . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognise the shape of the mouse pointing device . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse pointing device .
in the drop @-@ mode mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrows and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse pointing device in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can inv@@ ade the contents of the magni@@ fying window and move it with the arrow keys .
if you need to read the &amp; SH@@ IFT key , press or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the box window . note that the upper left corner of the drop cap is fixed , and only the lower right corner can be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; owns a lot of functions . you can copy the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts / stops the up@@ dating of the display . the up@@ dating of up@@ dating results causes the needed CPU time against 0 .
select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a select window will display . the selected area will appear in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically used your setup files for storing files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ ers ( using the button document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ sions &amp; etc .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen menu . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of screen , so as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from research or artists to web designer , or visually han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from re@@ peti@@ tive strain inst@@ ants ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and those any mouse click pains . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle pain when using the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may need to feel pain associated with the use of your computer , you should look for a doctor if this is not yet happened .
to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain avoid pain , which are caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by the cause of mouse , us@@ eless . and , as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be dropped for each different .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the motion .
is the intelligent shift activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the cr@@ ut@@ ches of the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little exercise , but you get used to it quickly .
this delay time has to be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; take a mouse click .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the rotary box is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set off , the m@@ k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after lowering the mouse button , before the mouse button is dischar@@ ged , if the mouse button doesn &apos;t get started .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the right and return , followed by a break , click on the right and returns a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt file when the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can catch &amp; K@@ DE ; to move the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , choose the sound system and click here to the tab . there is a sli@@ p@@ eg@@ ler sound buffer , which you turn on a lower value to reduce the antenna times .
if this setting is marked , will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; K@@ DE . this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , to find out how you start a program automatically .
sets the settings back to the values that were set when opening the dialog . you already have the button Apply , the settings are reset to the stand after the last push of application .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent reference should be switched off first . if you have used to get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the antenna times of &amp; K@@ DE ; at sounds too .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window , which do not display a link , does not lead to un@@ inten@@ tionally allergic reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it is usually quite easy . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come with the mouse ball into contact .
first you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse is to mouse . however , it should be clear , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have the ball away , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole that the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or finger nails .
in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the operating system of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re just going to shift the smart step , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end through rele@@ asing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click . this is reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; back and you can continue as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool to perform mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want to have it . but if you don &apos;t want to run the mouse on a neutral field of desktop , if you don &apos;t want to run out the mouse on a neutral field of mind . secure zones for the mouse pointing out , the grey areas around the tool bar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent inter@@ lock , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes his time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very likely to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board , to move it into the cli@@ p@@ board . however , it will probably cause them to cause some problems . here are some advice :
do not use the smart phone if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use it instead : perform a mouse click at the end of the text box while moving the mouse pointing to the other end of the text , and again the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always be played when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button lets you use a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , you have to have the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be the case in most system .
the feature of the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is available only if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; sec@@ ret@@ ched the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointing short . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and to which the beg@@ ot of the bri@@ st@@ ful pain is prepared .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins to get rid of the mouse process before the mouse button is started . in this way , also the pulling and lying with the mouse can be carried out .

at the first page of the assistant ( left ) enter the command , which is later used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup .
on the second page , select the standard text password book . you can often choose the text passages without need to type . text passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right screenshot ) you determine the dictionary for the word term . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words into the Wor@@ ter@@ ior section .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is confident and contains essentially a input field for the keyboard of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a run storage of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; correct , you can input the pro@@ positions you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the file memory . you can select from it sets that should be used again .
set up with the menu entry icon ; set up ... open the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialogue includes two box cards , speech output and settings , the site Wor@@ ter@@ ior , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service .
in the input field of the voice box , give the command to the language of the language . in the box below the input field you specify the character encoding , with the text to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the text box , if the text is unchanged as default entry to the language generator .
if the check@@ box is not selected , the text will be specified as a parameter , and you can use the following plac@@ eholder :
of course it depends on the language version of your language generator . you can find this command in documentation about your language generator . examples to be found in App@@ endi@@ x .
if you want to continue our language service as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . if that is successful , the further settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is available . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box , you specify which action is triggered by the key@@ note or by selecting a text passage in the Text password book , or in the box for text password .
with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen text passage is addressed directly , and additionally added to the input area . the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box Sch@@ ed@@ ging of the editing window , you can define whether the text password book can be stored automatically in the closing of the editing system .
with the selection of text password book , the book is stored . if you dis@@ card changes , the text password book will not be saved . select and ask , ask if the text password book shall be stored .
the site Wor@@ st box contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ter@@ ior . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this select box you can select the word used in the word processor .
with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books , or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary .
to select this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is easily identified by counting the list . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to include only correct words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask then , which may summar@@ ize dic@@ tion@@ aries , and how these weights are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly introduced words automatically adds to the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main area of the window to the processing of text boxes is two divided . in the upper part , the text books are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower section , you can edit an selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can only select the text passage or the associated button . if you select a text password book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text password or books add or selected text passages and books can either er@@ ase the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
you can change the sequence of text boxes or text @-@ passages by pulling together with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of the drive .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected , this will be used otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ wap mode .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text in input field is used , this will be used otherwise the selected sets of s@@ ali@@ va .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shifting tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands are displayed by default . by mouse click on the narrow@@ ly left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow glue is displayed in the bottom part of the main engine with points above the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , it will be displayed as default on the editing window directly under the tool bar . by mouse click on the narrow@@ ly left side and toes , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have the command for the speech output is not correct or not completely entered . open settings to mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for the speech output in the map language version . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer ) .
Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free to use and dis@@ semin@@ ate any restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for the speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the file / usr / local / festival . the command to language is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports the English language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free and spread without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ er folder . the language version is then possible with one of the three following command samples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default entry . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it turns a list of phon@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ st and / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la installed .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax like to be swallowed up the final mark of the text , so an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete order is more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ st / t@@ bro@@ mine -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ bro@@ la / de@@ 1 / / usr / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to be turned on as default input .
the speech output dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ no language service , available to all &amp; K@@ DE ; uses a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems .
since the language of the language can only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use a t@@ ach@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set up .
to set the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which will be installed in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t speak , can be able to spend text by the computer . it is stored a list of already spoken pro@@ positions that the user can always be re @-@ spending again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( give either this URL to the mailing bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or restart k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the speech output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is one of modules existing services that allows each application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for speech output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a joint application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications using T@@ TS capabilities . furthermore , it offers interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ applications is embedded .
the speech output is provided via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as the peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the production of language spending on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ aux@@ ili@@ ary program .
in the future : support for Speech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice service of &amp; K@@ DE ; an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d above kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the text of a website or parts .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read or partially read .
additionally to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ i ; in the K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility Mail@@ ing list . the developers can also find at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you &amp; kt@@ ts use , you have to install speech disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are established , the box map is displayed . see also . if you have established at least one speaker , the card number will be displayed . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , such as different male or female , or such , which can be seen in volume or speed . you should also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer ; use at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard loud@@ speaker .
different spokes@@ persons for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with multiple press lines for the same printer .
when you click on the board card speakers in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the box map is displayed . this will also appear automatically if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and is not yet a speaker .
all already recorded speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear above in the list . the upper speaker is used for speech output if a application does not provide a speaker .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to remove the spokes@@ man from the list .
select a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the order of the actors in the list determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ system .
select a mood type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girls voice to choose from .
if you click here , it appears on the new speaker on the board card speaker . to change the settings of this microphone , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; go back almost . go back to cart@@ ei@@ card , and check if the T@@ TS service is running ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so you can download &amp; kt@@ ts ; please click on the box card orders to create text applications and manage . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can launch the voice system of &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the cart@@ el tra@@ cker in general to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark the check@@ box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text requests and read text requests and be read . see . remove the marking , will be K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; K@@ DE ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , unless the field of language is dis@@ able ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this cross box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , dis@@ appears once the reading is complete .
with the buttons in this series , you can start text requests , pause and record again .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ section template or read a text file to read . you can also change the spokesperson for a job .
click on Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the box ticket orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD was started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cart@@ el tra@@ cker in general and cross the check@@ box ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . check out the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tools read text . after a short time the language will begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ st@@ lines and other un@@ seen stamps are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text file . check out the text , which should be read , and select in the main menu tools read text . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ a ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; which you will notify about of you fixed events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE , you can set up various types of messages . you can be noti@@ fied , if you notice that when in a IR@@ C channel a message appears when your nickname is found . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C news text .
supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application .
filter for the drawing item also offer a good opportunity in &amp; kt@@ ts ; it &apos;s a good example . it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b out of the messages sent by email , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as this is believed to be accepted as provided in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
in filtering , text is processed before it is sent to program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . you are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the methods of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will continue all other orders and keeps these orders . if the edition of the Screen @-@ Reader is read , the orders received will continue .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be reserved . a warning has priority and keeps the output from news and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of the warning .
News have the next collective priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of using normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of using a long text on a web site , you can meet &amp; k@@ mouth ; somebody is welcome to enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications are also news . read this .
the rest are simple text orders . every mission you used by the card card is a text job . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text applications . text requests are intended for issue longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are commissioned in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if a application sends the output of an Screen Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this issue is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen re@@ lie@@ vers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text applications as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News .
filters are editing the text , giving it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
replacing parts of a text by other text . you can deliver either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is provided with pre @-@ defined strings of chat messages such as : - ) by text or for transfer@@ ring news from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the scope of supply &amp; folders ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are used for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
for example , you can send orders depending on the text of the text or depending on the program that send the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have posted a female voice on the box , you can read text from K@@ DE messages . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filters is adjustable , according to which it is applied to a language version . if the filter determines its rules does not apply , it will continue to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text reservation , a warning , warning , or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all activated filters that were installed on the page below . editing is done in order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of shared normal filters . if a filter is not communic@@ ated , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following setup di@@ alogs .
if you have a list of words or regular expressions , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and small incl@@ ination is not considered .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose any name that you only have to distinguish from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , replacing it in accordance with the string out of the column . the list is shown in the displayed sequence from above down@@ wards .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list , or delete a list from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list .
if a language is registered , the filter is only used if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also press multiple languages when you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
if a value is registered , the filter will only be used if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple schemes separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you can only use the q@@ d@@ bus program with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; numbers need to take away . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; application @-@ ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is available , you are only allowed to type .
the drawing entry filter is applied only to the text if all conditions associated with one entry in box di@@ ments filter if matches . are all input fields empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when compared , the string re@@ plac@@ er filters use regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited by parti@@ tions ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; copy &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can be found in the box .
&amp; XML ; trans@@ former trans@@ duc@@ ers &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such applications . but it can only be installed on well @-@ formed XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c has to be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is achiev@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
for example , you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up on the box map , or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can define that text from k@@ mail can be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter is over@@ looked , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker properties that the program gives , the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the characteristics of the speaker speaker is selected . with the speaker selection filters you can over@@ write the chosen spokes@@ man .
if a value is registered , the filter is applied if the text has the selected regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; click on the button to get help on the input .
in order to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
place the properties of the desired microphone . if the text is checked up , the speaker is selected , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements . click on the button to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to store or download or delete all settings .
the speaker system is used only to apply to the text if all conditions apply with a entry in box Di@@ ameter filter if applicable . you have to apply at least one condition .
the voice API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programmer can lend its applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ;
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing it to use syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers .
the following section contains a brief description of &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is and Acc@@ essibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand speech output services via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ speech .
a text of text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands give you
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . start the tom@@ ts@@ d in a window , then tom@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have installed the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; file filters are set up , but when using the module for festival will not be read .
due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone to make sure that S@@ able is working at all . you can also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and you can find out about the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or character sequences appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences ski@@ pped or just Kau@@ b @-@ cat@@ fish . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . is there any problems with certain character or words , these may be solved by a drawing item filter . see .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or on the question web pages . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE Source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find the source code in the folder . in addition , you will find the source code of c@@ turn@@ out under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / .
includes many languages , a list of all current supported languages you will find at the Project page htt@@ p : / / Speci@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / famili@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
KT@@ TS is also working with any language syn@@ thesizer , which can be launched on the command line in one &amp; console .
the list of mentioned languages can be in@@ complete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , refer the description of syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and expand ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the developer team in connection .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filters is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need to comp@@ ile a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source code chi@@ v for k@@ de@@ co or to have downloaded from Tar@@ ball , translate and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ ts use , check first if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ sk@@ ript SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr must be so developed that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is di@@ pped into individual sets . the user can pick @-@ down or drop @-@ off , repeat the output or break off .
if an application provides text on &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have established a speaker , this language is English and whose sex is feminine , otherwise it will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , you see a speaker , you will see in .
if you click on the board card speaker , click to insert a present@@ er into the list or to edit , the card interface is displayed . as an example , the module interface for Festival Interactive is shown . details on modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you will only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting will be automatically made . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you represent volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot choose a some controllers and display these grey , the voice you can &apos;t choose these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ Vo@@ ices need to be loaded after their size several seconds due to their size . if you load this check@@ box , these voices will already be loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set is faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t added any speaker yet ( or click on Apply ) . see .
if this cross box is marked , the program window panel is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in system section to display the program window .
if this cross box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr still doesn &apos;t run , it appears in the system area when K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or ste@@ er otherwise .
here are all orders in the queu@@ es listed , along with the application , which has set the order , the number of sets and the straight set . the spokes@@ man ID is equivalent to the column ID on the box map speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can choose a full @-@ point in the order that is selected in the list below , or go back . ( but not every mission consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all the changes of the settings ( also on the other cart@@ on cards ) and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will shr@@ unk to the icon on the system section . click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de instead , click on the map audio . see also .

on this map , you can set particular actions that will always be executed if the text contract is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of speech contracts :
the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it is drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the Screen @-@ Reader has been read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
war@@ nings have priority a common priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor will be subject to hot . a warning keeps the output from news and normal text . these orders will be resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web site , you can greet you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; yet somebody welcome you to enter the room .

this audio file is always played when a normal text is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are valid only for normal text applications . for news , war@@ nings , and expenses of screen re@@ lie@@ vers there are no special actions , if they are interrupted by a higher priority .

the speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a speech output . this standard contains brands for control of voices , sound speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for the control of pron@@ unci@@ ation for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you have to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) because this is the default voice , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML issue .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog don &apos;t go to 100@@ L ; SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and Sat@@ u@@ bound@@ less recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . therefore , the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , as only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not to jump or pause or cancel , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers cannot directly support this directly .
here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the input is automatically set up automatically . you can change its settings or add another pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter , but the recipi@@ ents are rounded off .
at the easiest , you will learn the setup of the speaker selection . check out the box selection , select a number of properties and check out how the selection of the microphone has changed . of course , you have to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then , faster with reading , because only the first set must be processed and not the whole text box , which can last long ,
they then write records on the box card or break off , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ less recognition filter is automatically set up when you start a kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just be removed . change nothing at that filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition filter compare text with a regular expression of pun@@ ishing and app@@ end a tab@@ ul@@ ators ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) in front of the filters automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard sentence changes will be retained .
S@@ BD filter will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; messages ( k@@ not ) , war@@ nings , messages or the output of screen ra@@ bugs .
if you have removed the normal Sat@@ z@@ bound@@ less recognition filter , you can insert this again by charging the in &amp; kt@@ ts ; included file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the board game selection , you can over@@ write the application settings for application . the card card is displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the board card speaker ) . in other words , no inter@@ changeable qualities are sti@@ pul@@ ated .
use of the proper speaker , which has all the properties of a furnished speaking person . if you select the user &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; follow this speaker ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the nar@@ r@@ ator , who originally set the original properties .
select the method to input the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the select button .
select the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t play a role , you do not give anything .
mark this check@@ box when the property should have priority before other features . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output , it will always be used as a primary feature . if you want this feature rarely , you may need to specify the attribute language , if you know that a specific application text in another language is sent out in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area , which is most likely to clear the following , click on the drop button and then use the speaker , which is the closest to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr stops immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support but I do not get back trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts , was finished . probably , you have to register the G@@ ST register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer may be installed . you can try to upgrade or un@@ install g@@ amer .
the audio output of AL@@ SA is not working when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text reservation , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : drop to open PCM .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts involving AL@@ SA will prevent the simultaneous open of multiple PCM devices . hin@@ ts for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org .
I downloaded an extra voice for festival online . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals added the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL , on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the map of audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program SO@@ X has to be installed and has to be installed via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ ology shows how festival Interactive offers an attitude to speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filters for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML file filter , and put the microphone speed up .
I don &apos;t create that websites with a female voice read . I created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta appears the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . this makes the x@@ sl file for converting SS@@ ML according to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same is also true for VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a own drawing entry filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ ary or go back . on the box , orders will be displayed , the order cover only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
character sequences ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation point , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out filter . instead , use a filter for the pun@@ ctu@@ ality recognition instead .

you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions that are supplied with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions regarding the transfer .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that enables the administration of networking interface , routine and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable the user to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . module settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t install . physical devices and their drivers have to be functional and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all possible and enables the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on installation of &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network devices will be added later , the driver must be loaded with adaptation to the following files :
the module settings will be loaded when the network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is chosen to automatically detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform can not be recognized , the recommended selection is offered , the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and will be best . by checking the setting non @-@ re@@ ask , the definition can be met permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically be pres@@ et automatically .
changing the network settings are possible only in system administration mode . before , all options will be shown , which means the settings can only be considered , the change mode is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will enter the button mode at the right end of the module mode . it is necessary to enter the password mode .
in the system administration mode , the module &apos;s total functionality is available . this is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the adjusted network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button ... set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings menu displays the dialog with further opportunities .
with the selection Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP server will be fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode the TCP / IP information is required for each system start , so no additional setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP should be selected according to the system .
with the selection manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can set the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field net@@ mask , the net@@ mask is fixed .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alize the network interface of the bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not allowed , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address would not be used on the network . if an IP address would already be used . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or disabled according to requirements . switching on an inserted network device is performed by selecting from the list and click on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled according to requirements . activ@@ ating a activated network device takes place from selecting the list and click on the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net , convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks .
if computers are more than a network interface , the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway Computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name for the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS is trig@@ gering this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator on the name solution part of the Reit@@ er@@ solution solution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS entries can be arranged through a selection of a contract and connection or her@@ l@@ assi@@ fication in the list with the dum@@ plings , or to be arranged in priority .
by clicking button ... from the machine calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ vers dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of DNS server and then click the button Add . entry will then be added in the list .
from a group of calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will edit the dialog .
the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host name @-@ to @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily in the boat when no DNS servers are available . in small , connected networks can replace the DNS server .
usually , the list includes well @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses . these are still in the test release of IP must replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... The New alias entry is displayed .
enter the name of the known host and click the button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , de button Add several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of an emin@@ ently known host from the list and select Edit .... The dialog named Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command needs to be removed .
the homepage by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE will not be sufficient , but also the development planning with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended to be experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should afford this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic networks are given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf files are discussed . changeable configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . this app@@ endi@@ x will only support basic information about the integration of the PCs into a small ( home ) network .
currently , IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found large spreading . IPv6 is expected to pass through the future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the response administrator if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be selected any arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up one &apos;s own small ( home ) network use the IP address to be selected for this purpose , to avoid IP address accounts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , so their use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a Gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks usually addresses are used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all the computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP continuation .
the network address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in your local machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7@@ .0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files are located , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed in DSL connections , so it is no surprise when in case of active DSL connections , another content is defined to be specified .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is known that this file is sorted by using the scripts in sub @-@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can see a list of already selected tasks and corresponding environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear both for all users of the system as well as for system internal tasks . each file can be opened and will be folded .
for a de@@ activated job , program name and parameters are not displayed and below description appears disabled .
the variable environment variables , otherwise , are the existing environment variables for all listed tasks , except force . when a de@@ activated variable appears to be disabled .
to create a new task , first select the tasks folder . go to edit New ... Altern@@ atively you can also click on the right @-@ right mouse button and click on New ... Select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
enter the name of the start program . you can either specify a relative or an absolute boy name . if you want to search the program first , press exit ....
select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be carried out . using &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
if you specify both monthly day ( s ) as well as week@@ day ( s ) , the program will be executed at a suitable date as well as on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the selected months , regardless of the week &apos;s day , no matter what the date they fall .
as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been stored .

to delete a task , select the task of del@@ eting tasks . go to edit menu Edit .
to enable or dis@@ able a task , select it , and select the condition with the menu option Edit . active tasks are marked in their description with in@@ active .
alternatively , you can also select and select with the right mouse button on the task and select . verify that program name , parameters and description will be displayed correctly .
to execute a task immediately , select it and go to Edit Now .
to create a new environment variable , first select the variables folder . go to the menu Edit New ...
alternatively , you can click on the variables folder and select New ... Select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; N .
specify the name of the variables . you can also select one out of the list of the most commonly used environment variables . please click on the arrow next to the Vari@@ ant name . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the rest programme to another as the normal address
as in the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab has been stored .
to cut a variable , choose first to remove the remote variable . go to edit output .
to copy an environment variable , first select the variable variable , go to edit copy .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select copying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .

if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you &apos;ll need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu option to save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements of tasks or variables will only be active .
it appears the standard K@@ DE ; -@@ dialog box . if you select ID , you see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the dialog box .
printed the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users , the extended per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the user plans .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ ity &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a f@@ use for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was to create a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar in a quick , selective outlet . the second target was the answer of a question that my wife asked : how much longer it takes to be secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be stored by &amp; dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ itting the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ferences on the band are not , you will be asked whether the tape is supposed to form@@ at@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ ju@@ dice , looking for the appropriate index on your record . cannot be found whether the band index is to be created .
everything went smoothly , the symbol is changing for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the Status Bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the band can now be searched for the band .
before throwing the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this to do this :
&amp; dat ; gives a change of symbol for the band that the binding is solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without risk .
before a band can be used by &amp; dat ; it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted .
a tape drives must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not comply with the form@@ att@@ ing at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not need to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band of &amp; k@@ dat ; form@@ at@@ ted a form@@ att@@ ing of the band ahead , DA@@ T drives do not work .
after entering the band name and the capacity will drive &amp; k@@ dat ; with the band &apos;s form@@ att@@ ing . all data on the band are lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process the tape is automatically inserted and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the encrypted files . this can happen to three types :
select one file or folder in local file tree . it will only be saved to this file or folders .
mark a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in local file tree with a h@@ ooks . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder are secured .
right click the right @-@ right mouse button on the local file @-@ tree and select in the Sh@@ ech@@ os menu ...
once the backup was initiated , the dialog will open for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , dialogue : dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or folder in one of the file entry for the drive . it &apos;s only checked the selected file or folders .
mark the files in one of the files for the tape with a h@@ ooks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ....
once the test procedure has been launched , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , dialogue will appear . this dialogue shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can use the recovery , the files you need to recover will be selected . this can be made up to two types :
select one file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a ch@@ icks . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select in the menu ...
once the recovery process has been launched , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and change the file folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialogue appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the transformation process , and the data through@@ put , and the remaining time .
sometimes it shows itself as necessary to recre@@ ate the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process cle@@ ars all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
this is a f@@ use profile with the just selected files and default settings . you can use the following settings for ensuring the safety profile :
the current working folder , in which the backup should take place . the list of noti@@ fied files is automatically updated according to the selected file folder .
for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files are stored on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are mounted on other file systems , you can name separately under backup files . each entry is considered from tar independently from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files are secured , which have changed since then .
the name of the file , which is used for determining the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before the tar call . this causes all files to be secured and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files were not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set up on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in menu settings . the following settings can be required :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ location version of the band device .
if this setting is active , transmit &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command is dischar@@ ged to the drive . for some drives this is necessary , before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; kno@@ dat ; to un@@ lock the throw from the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the loos@@ ening of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically cast the tape . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware size is to change for tape drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to tell &amp; dat ; in any case , block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the band . this file should only prove one memory block on the band . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the name : seconds , where the name is the complete name of the system , which the band form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era has been form@@ at@@ ted into the band .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can be administr@@ ated directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act for incre@@ mental f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup copy . this symbol is only active when a band is in@@ bound .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system , or where the system log the different protocol files . moreover , the system enables quick access to information about problems based on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . it is a simplified representation of the protocol @-@ files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log allows you to provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , some advanced functions are preparing to extract and evaluate the protocol @-@ files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 offers &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a series of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screenshot you see &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with their help to filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file easily and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
following the start &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol , will not be displayed . if you &apos;re not running a small message window , you &apos;ll usually find it on Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to filter strings . in default settings the list of log files will be automatically deleted . in default , a protocol line will be displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line is displayed only if included in one of the columns of the filter search criteria .
you can also select another entry on this site . the string of the filter search ri@@ ffs will then be matched only with entries in the protocol @-@ file system protocol , and apply in the filter bar on the name of a process , so you can download &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you identify the important protocol lines . protocol @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a visible color as protocol lines of level hint . the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off .
if you want to display certain process only ( for example in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can be useful for example if you want to investigate the output of a particular command such as the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can add the option to new lines in the context menu of the main f@@ lin@@ ers to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ stations . to open this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you have selected a window , select a protocol on display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website at htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum software softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g D@@ ort you will find further information about the source sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log .

welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather well known ( and in the following also named as ) &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the V In@@ it System develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program launches in the &amp; Linux ; hence , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re @-@ form@@ att@@ ing . therefore you need to be sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service , which you want to start taking on another run@@ level . system services include such matters such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such stuff like set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on its part under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use of it . you can also make a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection .
the kernel searches for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first he finds .
the default run@@ level is available in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably discover that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand , then you can repair it manually by using the system re @-@ run and run the following :
but how does it begin with all the right scripts ? if you do -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument such as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one includes a K , the script will be called with the argument . if it includes an S , the script will be called with the argument .
some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could take &amp; eg ; a server running level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user @-@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index is easy to say not to say tri@@ vial : simply pull one entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ els or modify the position within one level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if they draw out a entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed if you have to copy these in a new run@@ way . to select it only on a new run@@ level , you must select explicitly copy from the menu menu and insert into the target range -- even then , if the same record already exists in the target range of action .
the sor@@ ti@@ ary number of a details can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the surrounding numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service .
note : there are currently no way to restore entries which were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab button to activate the various working ranges ( Available System Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous .
to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ti@@ ary number or the name of a details manually , press the input button to open the properties dialog . please use the dialog by re @-@ pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
because of the risk of data los@@ s@@ ement , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are collected in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; again , changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with standard Run@@ lev@@ els , and now the machine starts permanently new . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ use mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should be all right ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the type of which system services are started in these distri@@ butions , however , is simplified the configuration for proprietary deposits in this distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please verify that all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also , whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) simply quit without message if your configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me more information about the Run@@ level so that this manual may be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you need to store them . either use the corresponding icon of tool bar or entry store in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two box cards , user and user guide . to edit the desired users or the desired group with double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog User and Group Features .
some box cards are only represented when you have activated extended system settings . only if you have activated multiple restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , you will be able to display individual settings . additional boxes cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD uni@@ forms .
the password card password is published if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD uni@@ forms are installed .
this card card is only activated , if for at least one @-@ connected file system space limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( det@@ ectable in the file quot@@ as / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby the limited restrictions are in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the field &apos;s help field .
the board map groups inform@@ s information about the group assign@@ ments of the selected user . the default group , to which the user you will find in the Pri@@ m@@ eric Group . furthermore , the user can mark in other groups by marking it in the large field .
the dialog characteristics of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , add the user or group menu , or click the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected users or the selected group works similar .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO @-@ Boot@@ Manager , remove and change the boot password , remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
