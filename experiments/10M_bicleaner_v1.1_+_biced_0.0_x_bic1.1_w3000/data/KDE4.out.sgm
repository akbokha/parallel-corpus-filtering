<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; represents another view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative to the various icons and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists in it to depict file hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportionally to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of suborderly objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the size of the size of the entries is specified. therefore, large files can be easily detected, if they can be seen far below in the folder hierarchy; therefore, it can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX Â® command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation of a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles of useful color display and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle which is switched on display color mode, can display either depth for the easy recognition of wearing discounting or the figure of another file association such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various features of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature you can specify if there is enough space for display, or whether the area of subordinate recesses are present, or if the surface of subordinates should be used (whereby consequently, the description of subordinate may occur in the sign of the Treemap). furthermore, you can designate the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of performances for Treemaps, the rule should be held proportionally, that the surface is proportionally kept. in the Treemap in & FSView; this target will not always be kept. in order to complete the screeching of the entries, and this frame is not always available. note that less space is lost for frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the layout of the area is done for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left up. here, it is necessary for labelling and avoidance of space losses incurably, that rectangles that are square. the best methods of this are lines, columns, or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal surface for one entry over the menu entry. instead, an Rautenpattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an underordered entry.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact & Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera also appears as a disk drive system. the connection can also be realized via the Picture transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">The program gPhoto2 supports communication with digital kameras. gPhoto2 is a free, continuous software collection for digital cameras, which is an increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 is also supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows to transfer images of digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calculator. as photos generally are large files and transmission over the serial port, this connection is now obsolete. & digipadded, supports the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 needs to be created with libexif support, which can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not be able to move anything or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digipiers is how easy its functionality can be expanded through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is a approach to develop a joint module structure for & digipiers;, PhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview is available. the aim is to provide the modules for the KIPI modules in this section.</seg>

<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before you have to keep your system stored in your system. you have to decide whether other access to your photos should have to store if you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly on your location. if you have enough photos, then you'll be able to organize your file as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will not be able to organize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option in the list of metadata in & digitize. this ensures that Exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget it then you can then save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change? in addition, & digitize; to provide a metadata Editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now select any photograph, signalling and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's start with keyword, keyword, as you are often called on other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source containing embedded keyword, then digitization will automatically add the tree to the right place. converting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be replaced by removing a subtree to another. the changed sample are taken from & digipolls; last updated while the subtrees are pursued.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overcut. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keyword - the next section refers to craftings or comments using the third important tool to catalyze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of them don't want to let anybody know your photos, they want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how to arrive at your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer look at some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say you this the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may perhaps even hear the silence. so the labelling has changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself. if you show images, you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning to the viewer, to help him help you understand what you are moving about what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It's alright if a picture is not perfect, if it's the strength only with a labeling for itself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can save a lot of text in an international alphabet (UTF-8) as a labeling. if you want to export it to a selection of pictures simultaneously. if you export your images into web galleries and / or the title of web-gallery system, you'll have to tell the story for opening a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet on GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train from the spatial presentation is now already with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities for geolocalization are already countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that you can open your journeys through pictures with geographical data. you can also export the pictures at reception. however, you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc. with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and designate the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions about the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all-changed versions, i.e. for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information came in on & digitization page; as information is required:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for manufacturers and authors): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired, the name of a company or organisation can be used. after which this value was saved, it should not be changed anymore. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonymous with the author): associated with the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples include: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a comment on the author's box, this must be filled in this case.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for vendors): use the Anbieterfeld to identify who this photo offers. if the photographer wants to offer a news agency as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a store photo, then the image / agency will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not have any protection against abuse. everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computer is able to delete or modify. the solution for this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and Halb professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in the picture. & digipiers; is available in the near future a module for the stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record defect, record loss, current, ECC, transmission error, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desaster, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we are not talking about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kind of losses are the same which can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll Ontrack, the largest data production company in the world, has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you must not need to be treated more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archivquality. of course, you can claim even more expensive and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves. whether you believe it is in your sigh playroom.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you can reduce good discos and good recording speeds, and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. it is therefore the correct one to choose.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors, even if you just wrote only. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for formatting and control of control. despite this massive protection they are needed by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there's a favourable program called IsoBuster. it works under Windows and & Linux; it's still not available for Macs. there are also similar applications the damaged data of damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to save the Formatkrieg against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-quality media. also, please check the media with a description, date & author identification and afterwards protected by a clean, dark dry and before animals protected site. don't forget to copy the data on the next generation of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Flooraries retain your statistics for themselves. its manufacturer features include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard disks: disseminal Study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos the longest if you are operated at the temperature range of 35 Â° C to 45 Â° C. The most common error of error, SMART cannot determine the error. some of the SMART confirmed this error. these are especially readers of readers. the expected lifetime of life expectancy amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a current account before you have secured the files, but these losses normally have to produce without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices are not much, this can take advantage of devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware age, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current tips is a overvoltage protection. this is a device that is absorbing a part of the energy heat and the rest. it is usually available in the form of a slot bar. remember that not every plug bar also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for a overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it protects you protection against lightening, and protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers are also applicable to telephone lines and cable modems, which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks, and therefore you also contain the protection for the modem. so you are ideal for travelling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection system protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you. even an issue of a few seconds can result in loss of irreplacable data. it may therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overvoltage devices, these devices can automatically adjust the battery power. however, some models allow them to store and keep the system ordered. if you buy a USV, you should be sure that they might be able to keep the same quality requirements such as a overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the surrounding software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare and compare its safety in blackout to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection may cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you think you are using it. at the end you should always remember all cables before you go to holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service. with the correct configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux; Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup target for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any quantities of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are compared to the hard drives home but very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you have to send the data on comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable for a solution to local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB. the professional version provides you more, in the case of Flickr more dramatically. for $25 a year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked out in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, web solutions are very safe. data transfer errors are automatically cleaned up to the TCP protocol and contain a secure memory. therefore, they are desaster safe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the calculator. all transfers are prone to transfer errors. the file system and btrfs are at least certain data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you do not have any protection to your machine. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable networks are a further source of translucting, as they generate interruptions within the data flow. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transfers, you should see in the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors each year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle and scalable with record defects. it is open source, with many patents and is available under an GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms by using and is also available for & Linux; but it's not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses in the notebook and 46% for workplace systems. Notebooks, for notebooks, is already the proportion of theft of 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people. it is currently limited to a lower damage, such as theft steels or newinstallations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux; none of them have been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. please find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigational interruption occurs during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the largest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. this means that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic of all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the final result is rather deteriorating. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel cameras. even DSLR cameras required your limit at 10-12 megapixel cameras. for higher resolutions, you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB HDD is currently available for 100 & euro; so you don't make any other users responsible for data loss. so, you can save your data frequently after a plan, and test this fuse before you do something dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of records or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected during the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget plane accident: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster flexion means a non-local storage. bring your attention up the stairs into the neighbouring house, into your office or the like.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as already mentioned above is a frequent reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files is supposed to be secured. it is a moment of moments without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential: a backup of the files have been changed since last complete recovery. generates complete moments of time on two periods: the end-to-end security and the last difference.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup the files that have been changed since last backup. you can restore the original status to any time. this fuse comes to a versioning system on the next with the exception which is only aborted and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only the difference of files the really changed. this happens and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore life. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the working files. at the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly moments for each month. any further cutouts should be done manually, after which you have done a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associating XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, re-finding images and metadata, copying the pictures to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year, that is about the time period in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Because the future is unforeseeable because of its nature, you need to consider and reassess the time with caution. unfortunately, there is no other way to be backward. every 5-8 years should you ask yourself as the current system backward. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so, if you have an old system, then it is important to read and install it in a virtual machine for a later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and fuse technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. actually, it always means to increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability to plan and set the range you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and add it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command whether your new record was recognized by the system, but do not hang them.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / SDB [#] of = / dev / SDC # source is / dev / SDC & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBgt; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is available, you can create this yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. you should therefore not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard for the GIF. it may be lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and a slow compression is required. this format we want to save you for saving your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression saline (default). however, a problem is, however, that this format has been adapted from many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital negative file format is a licensed free and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer asks DNG already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. file information are allowed to include the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the rough format, as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can be noted to problems with link between metadata file and the image file, and so you should consider whether you use DNG as container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, supporting a large area of application purposes and business models. among the activities of DCMI activities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifying efforts to achieve a further acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the pictures on the camera service are, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert Rohfiles to DNG and save them in your rough archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the pictures again with & digiplug, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut down under any circumstances of the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. export them to Webgaleries, add in mpeg, use in contact page, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digip. in the section adding a photos to a record, you can add a description as you can already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing pictures to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, use this with the calculator, turn the camera on display mode, and turn it another. a further description is found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it may take a while to connect with your camera. if the connection is produced, a hex indicator will display a while. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need to see the camera information on each entry. with the sidebars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the features of a details or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialogue shows file properties and the photo information to be stored in the camera. a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras, you can't find all information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's notice, GPS, etc. of the picture. these information are the same as at metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or the image processing. note that these metadata is not available on some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then select the photos from their camera to a single album in & digiplug. in downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were sure to be released in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the selected editor of & KDE. once you have selected the photos, you can download the button downloaded and then selected. the button chosen can be selected as long as you chose some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this is an option available to download. these pictures have not yet been downloaded from & digiplug. in this case, the new pictures have been selected with a star in the window window. if you choose this option, you will only download the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download the buttons All download or selected files, a dialogue with which you can select the target album, displayed as normal folder, displayed in the section of My Albums. select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digipadded; downloads the photographs from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the required photos, you can delete it from the camera. if you want to delete all the button, you must first select this first and delete the delete chosen.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility that you have deleted from the camera. so the photos will not be deleted in the trash of & KDE; so you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted by the camera. if you want to delete the camera image, you should make this much faster than that.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as a filename for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the file names will normally be upgraded once again after the photos taken from the camera. therefore, it may be useful, the date and time, in which the image was made to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and date-based subsidy. if you use this last option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the transmission opens three more options to be performed before the photos stored on the disk. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information into the IPTC fields are copied. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-% -% d% H:% M:% S. switch the option date & time. for more customization, you should read the command's help.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the ability to change the file names in lowercase, or if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digiplug, is displayed below the name, displayed below the name, displayed the camera in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digipiers; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the heart. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section side bar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is switched on, and if your camera does not deliver these information, lets & digipadded; the photo in the original orientation, use the knob and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made available on the date of which the photo was made available, can be downloaded & digiplug into the image data. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same subtitle. not all cameras are available in the same subtitle. not all cameras are available to read what information your camera could be embedded in the photographs.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case stores & digipiers; the photos are directly on the target album. if you want to change this option. use the button Advanced and select the option file-based bottom line at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from her host to your camera is the button Download. select the file extension dialog & KDE; you can also select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the Standard & KDE; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug where images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. thus, a position is meant that can be displayed in longitude and latitude. the identification of data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photography, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographic an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you forgot later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a postcard to another & digitization; if you want to locate a postcard to another & digitization; users want to locate the location of the photos, or simply use this aspect, it's good to enrich the position data of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map referrals. it is at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via editing the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual) and last about the manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is no camera that has a GPS unit integrated. but there are a few that work with GPS receiver. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsone or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the GPX format, as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for Windows and Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and extract from the GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: psCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the pre-established coordinates required by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street types. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, all show details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digipiers; try to give you so much control over his working processes as possible. there are many settings that come into the Settings menu. to set up this settings, you must set up in eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can be shown on deposit preview or image editing will be set. they put the standard behaviour of & digiplug. fixed when you click on a entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as below, shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data will automatically be selected to the corresponding IPTC data protection. in case of database synchronisation, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the editor: this field should be the profession of the photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a further description of a car field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not need to be the author, if this is a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations will be listed here, then the group or agency that the image should be shown here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC-Felders. by this way the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digipadded; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digitides; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image marking as embedded fittings (JFIF) in JPEG image: this synchronizes the comments that you can add to your photos, with the images embedded in the images. attention: in pictures that already contain signs, these are overwritten by the digitization.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings include all the options for the information that appear if the mouse pointing at the main window about one file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitization; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to determine which file types & digiplug, you can add the file extensions of this list and remove any file extensions, who doesn't have any of these extensions, from & digipadded; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">Default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on your right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminescent material of & digitised; can be set on this page to the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. however, the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; should you only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can obtain a better understanding.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch the toolbars if you use the image processing in fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brighter color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this clearer mode with F10 and F11 can be switched off and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are coded in higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the specific explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG files you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a low-loss algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. thereby, 1: a low and 9 means a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">When the TIFF files compress compress the default setting of TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, since the default algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss of low-free JPEG 2000 files you can easily store loss. even if you have the loss of loss of loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata was still not supported, but found in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photographs. currently, it is very quickly developed to manipulate your photos. with this dialogue, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default pattern is that all green pixels are equal to ultraviolet light. if you use this option, this difference is a bit soft, eliminates this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option records the picture a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 lattice with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white turn of the camera will be used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white is not set. standard is it a fixed color balance, which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. by using the second sensors, the effect that underette images get more details in the Spitzlichens. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the hairy, so the parts of your images are to catch the hairy white in the settings when the inability of your camera demonstrates the setting of the setting. finally, you can try to reconfigure out some of the missing information in various rosatballs. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not vary as quickly as green and red. & dcraw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red-parts from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option redesign, you get the possibility to set a level. this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted to each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. however, you'll probably need to set it somewhat higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitization; image processing can be made small, you should be conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo process algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particle data sensor, which have many cameras and the Matrix colorful pixels are available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color-structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digipiers; and Dcraw are available to you three alternatives: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenetic interfaces), the first algorithm created by Dcraw. it produces color artefacts on the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color variation of your lenses you can set the red and blue ofreading values here. this is certainly the best method for a different color correction, as you will be performed during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this should be given back. there are also LCMS and & digipadded; information such as the color formations of a color space in the other, so that the colors are as closely as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior asking questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Colour profile file set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you all store your profiles. & digipadded, these folders will be examined during the launch.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC Profiles you have the opportunity & quot; standard squot; for your profiles, everything can be changed when opening the rough file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures colored not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be fit to the camera manufacturers and model that you use. not all profiles are created on the same type. there are some, like Canon, which do not contain any colour mapping or Gammakoratory. this means that you do not have to perform the colour mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft Proof-Profile, with which you can emulate the picture of a device again. this is very useful before you can print the picture, as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors. this could be correct, instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is designed for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon propane extension lets the style realize: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & KDE; image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a series of & KDE; image viewing and image processing is supported. many modules have been written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select which you want to use, and these modules will then be downloaded from & digiplug. these modules appear as new entries in the main menu and in addition, you will find some of the menu in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks, which are performed by modules, can set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) over KIPI modules, you can get via the KIPI project at http: / / www.tipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the seashau should be easy to understand. the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other cross fields turn the metadata or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is connected to identify the camera. if you want to use it, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image display mode. there are now serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have a USB- or FireWire-mass storage that you have to be attached to your camera here.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, you must connect the camera to your computer, put it in display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out whether & digipiers; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. once you have installed your camera, your camera appears in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main menu cameras from the main menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the trashine, you can adjust the discussion of & digiplug. when clearing a photos in an album, you'll find further details in the cut-sections of a photos and delete a record.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes due to the right sidebar can be tackled by & digiplug, if you use the option to use changes in the right sidebar without feedback. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also see the display of the welcome image of & digiplug; at boot time. this accelerates the start of & digitization under circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting is looking for new photos and digitization; the base file after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digipadded. if something from the base file was deleted, asks & digipadded, whether it should be removed from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be used in & digiplug, select the main window to adapt to your taste. these settings can choose among settings design from the toolbar. a preview of available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digipiers, please find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement. the image processing can be launched by a click with the left mouse menu to preview the preview menu and selection of details / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug. so, you are not part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, you can set up in the section image processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom edge of the window, the filename, current filename, magnifying factor and the current image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar on the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, if you don't want to change the original photo before you save file, or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have stored the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So, maybe you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save you with file saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by repeating the image processing or the knob button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done on the photo since last Save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be reversed and reproduced. the last action can be reversed, by editing editing, or re-manufactured using the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keynote abbreviation, Ctrl; -z for recovery and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; for a moment longer, press a context menu in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have launched the image processing, you can use between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the menu. if you have made changes on the current photo, you will be asked if you want to back up.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can in the photo in and get out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse's bike or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the menu menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen, the photo is displayed in full screen mode. if you do not want to use the tool bar. if you do not want to change the tool bar. if you do not want this, you can call this out of the & digiplug; main window. see the section to setup image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, select a picture in the image menu and get the Standard & KDE; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the Main Menu you can print individual images or entire phrases. you only have to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album, you'll only need to follow the assistant, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side bar on the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected pictures. the same page bar is available without the navigation system, even in the image processing. it is displayed if one of the five riders is clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiflap clicking on the same rider will disappear or disappear in the edges.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view you can input signals with unlimited size or insert. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and are designed to use special characters. if you want to use IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you comments, use either the button Apply or change to the next image, the labelling will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, this is always done when you select a metadata setting, which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">This section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. in order to evaluate more images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written into the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword shows a search box to filtering the keywords, the sample-tree, and a select box with the previously mentioned in this & digiplug; session-related keyword.</seg>
<seg id="362">The sample-tree is adapted dynamically to the selected search phrase. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword fast. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering the sample in a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, they are stored for fast access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Passwords can also be set by markers of the respective local crossings in the tree. all aspects of a picture are stored into the IPTC field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want to select a selection with keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search results. if additionally one or more sample filter from the right side will be used, only the intersection of these two are displayed. all displayed keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and remove them. suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can easily move from the right side bar and place on the selection. then a dialogue, which you asks, whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword is based on no keyword, which has been selected with Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword from the right sample tree was drawn to the selection and placed there. a dialogue asks whether this keyword is supposed to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at each start of the program. you can also be accessed below settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and determine that it's a or must be, you can easily change this easily with a double-click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string which is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can define an extends search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the checkbox at the end of the rule, and after the knob group. the options look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space site is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I was primarily adapted to & digitised; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you set a color-administered workflow, which can actually be photographed by your camera or scanners. with a color-managed workflow, you can get that the colors on your monitor uses the same color or scanner, and the colors that you print or publish the colors of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic of color management comes, everyone would like to know what buttons it must press for the results he wants. unfortunately the sense of this tutorials is to provide sufficient background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image sequence meets all six criteria listed below, you must not take care of the color scheme.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture spending are by e-mail or the web, where the RGB of the de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for all so easy, why should one use another colour space and do so with so thoughts about colour controls?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that can see, the hugs-shaped region, and the colours in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colors, visit Bruce Lindblooms, and then click on info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to handle my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the sRGB color space or not, you need to monitor your monitor via sRGB. if you are working as a RGB of sRGB, you must either use your monitor on sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool produces five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. so, use it before you try to try further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The normalize, unequal, automatical and contrast is extending from the menu, auto-correction try to automatically make your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects, to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the volume exceeding the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shading. this feature often is a magical correction for pictures the dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Unequalled: this method is adjusted the intensity of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity of the image is as flat. sometimes it also produces very good results in improving the contrast of the image, sometimes it also produces a very powerful operation which causes either wonder in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright margins and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast to the contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminous intensity of the RGB values of a picture by the lowest and highest values on the largest possible area and a rejiusade of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The whiteness of & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to carry the white abetting of a photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-equal correction is slightly restricted to a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can operate too far from the original picture, if you can operate the white directly in rough mode, which will improve your possibilities for correction better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white equhysine of the copyright law of Pawel T. Jochym. it is launching the menu entry colors white to the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, both the original picture as well as the preview of the objective is adapted. if you want to see the original whitish, then it is enough to click on the window window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photographs features a red markers. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right there is a histogram shown that dynamic is modified as soon as you change one parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow of alignment makes you improve or download the shadow enddetails of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play the above controls above, you should use the colour temperature Pipette. press on this button and then click on the image preview for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">Additionally, you can set the white directly with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator indicator increases the colors, if more than a colour channel of pixel overexposed. this will be displayed as a pure indicator as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons saving as and loading exactly this. any attitude of the white balance you have set you can store in a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button settings will return all the filter values again to their standard values and the corresponding neutral white comparison. note that even neutral settings are given another photo than your original. if you save them, your original picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set up the code depth per color channel per color channel. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suitable for high-quality images. however, this encoding requires more record space, computing time and only stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialogue as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profils. color tonic can be carried out through the underwindow for the use of color profiles, you can draw the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu of colors of Tonwertcorrection. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction. in the manual for the Tonwertcorrection, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool Farbeet Effects provide four colour effects, a solar thermal effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a barrier filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical workmanship, it was also called Solarisation, as well as Sabatier, a effect that was created in partially developed under a short lightening. this result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what chemical is possible. another increase is finally created, a negative image that does not generate on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar thermal system. the original picture is the (1) and that processes (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation that he makes a stronger contraction effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easily, he embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a full colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours at daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some pictures, especially those who weigh hard scenery, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on counterparts. parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the firing repetitions. in great pictures the filter can compensate the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and luminance of the photos in the menu. once you're satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can reduce the reverse problem. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation. all changes you can do in preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchintensity / contrast / Gamma is the tool clercorrection for improving exposure. even if dialogue with this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of slider. specifically the three shooting below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains one graphs of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slips into the inside and the left side can change to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn operation is to shift the regulator and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview of the image is dynamic, updated by the image settings. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set if the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of digital camera, linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic income is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for bright sounds and the lowest for medium sounds, often called gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original picture to adjust the input of the shadow, medium and bright sounds automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit status: the output value allows the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values, e.g., to create output values, e.g., to create an external image as background, while something else is foreseen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: this button will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the image values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Store and store: stored in the filesystem, stored in the file system and later reloaded, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input will automatically be adjusted for all shadows, resources and sun oils. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original figure for Red, Green, Blue and Luminant channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option Exasket Indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect shown only in preview, and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example for the alignment of the inputs applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target picture shows. the preview of view is updated dynamically, depending on your settings. on the right-hand side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modification channel: this select box allows to specify the channel, which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are located between a linear and logarithmic view. mostly linear mode is the linear mode. for pictures featuring large areas of constant colour, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a new ventricular to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds are related to darker outlet, which are darker to the related image pixel.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marking is shown. if you want to shift this marking on the curve, a matching line is displayed on the curve, which is the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and off, until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: you can do this with these buttons. every curve that you can create is stored in the file system and later loaded, the file format is Gimp's format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour pipette buttons automatically create the controls of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue- and luminescent curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option Extended Indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect shown only in preview, and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white picture that was corrected by the Luminaire channel. shadow and SonnentÃ¶ne was used with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digipiers; image processing is a tool to improve the canals or to change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color-Mixer 'menu.</seg>
<seg id="443">You can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture features a red markers. if you position this in the image a vertical line in the histogram to indicate the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right: controls for red, green and construction, it will enable you to adjust the image of the color. if you can also activate the corresponding color components, as the channel mixer, then DAS tool to produce great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color comes from a visible space that comes from farbrauschen. colourless consists of small smokartefacts that appear differently in each channel. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colourless first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The saving as and store buttons are just used for this purpose. any Mixer's adjustment can be saved for later and then download. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option Exasket Indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect shown only in preview, and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was adjusted. the option Luminance is activated. the original picture is under (1) and the working image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white-photography always was fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step, because color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of movie rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks great, at all scenarios and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orantes: simulates a black / white film exposure with a orange linden filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Orantes.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial-effects and can simulate Moonlight from time to time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: generates warm and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the shadow. this is very similar to the trial of a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug; tool texture you can apply decorative textures on one image.</seg>
<seg id="458">Adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can look like a oil painting, a pop Art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall. the menu entry image texture is used for this image processing.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth and three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and that modified (2). parameter relief is set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; mould frames can be added a decorative framework to be added a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">The eye of a viewer in the limits of a photos is not easy task. to keep its attention, it is a psychological barrier for the setting eye. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be launched from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, put the image type with a colored line, niepce surrounding it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttoning effect and decoratively add an ornamental frame with pattern.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: the width of the frame is in percent. the range of value for width is 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This with a separate target image will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you use the tool to cut the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple text-formatted text into a picture at any place. this also applies to more places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. use text-replacement, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its features like you need. the larger the picture, the larger the character set should be. finally, select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any attitude that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press on the button "OK" after the picture has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool stencil, you can create a template over one image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template: apply in image processing can be used to put templates about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and should add with maximum compressing (9) to remove the file size of the template. please send an email in english to the & digipadded; Mailing list digipcvs-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you will need to put your template folder with the knob base folder. select the folder in which you have copied template files. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils was reflected in a building view, which is reflected the folder structure of the template's document. selecting a folder the preference bar of stencils will be updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview, three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image. it is centered around the position of mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the picture below. it is centered around the position of mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to reduce the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Shift: use this button to move the image below the template. use the image and put it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. image will then be adapted automatically.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; sets three different tools available for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture of sharper. actually, it's not a bit more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it is a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refokusher may be the best of the three, as he really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is the smaller edges a bit shy. the same phenomenon can be coded into a common colour. the same phenomenon can be easily printed when color points can be printed on paper. SLR cameras need normally more retrofit sharpening as normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG image, a camera has been used in internal sharpness. images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already turning a sharpness while reading the image. if you disable this turn, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening workstation. you can correct it with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should use it carefully because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edges of the edges, but intensifying the noise. in general, you can easily correct use of the tool refusing. in refusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to make the picture a bit soft, is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool for plasticiser, and experiment a little with settings. the window window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unmistakably masked is a very good tool to remove muffers from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and preview can help you edit the picture. the window window is showing the output of the filters with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values generate frequently good results and should be tried out first. if you make the unsharpness mask too strongly, get a noise and impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected on each side of a edge through the filters. high-resolution images are allowing greater radii. they should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a fracture of the maximum RGB-value and the differential amount. you can therefore define a minimum difference in order for a edge of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpening and therefore the beauty flaw avoided in faces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original picture is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp masket was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool Refokussis refocuses on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use the copyright protective filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to make a picture of & quot; refocsing quot; in which it is a better approach to sharpening the photo. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of an unsharpest mask. Refokusze usually achieves better results than irregular masket. you can launch it from the menu by calling colors Refokusze in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular construction works much better than the Gauss's Filling. the GauÃ'sche Filling is also dependent on the source pixies that are far from the original quelllow pixel. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauss's Filling is influenced by far from the distant pixels, causing undesirable outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular shaped bottom. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should be 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is very unpleasant, but then you should pay attention to Heiligenpons.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in smoking filter may help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poorly. a useful value is 0,03. a high value is added to the picture.</seg>
<seg id="502">GauÃ's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpen Gauss is. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 to increase annoying artifacts, so you may also increase the correlation and / oderden noise filters.</seg>
<seg id="503">Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, this value determines good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the GauÃ's edge. however, you should select large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The saving as and store buttons are used exactly for this purposes. any modification of any refussis parameters you have to be stored for later and then can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cut, color and intensity corrections before the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture before. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not able to appear immediately, but left uncomfortable artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read pictures and read it, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, non-sharp mapping produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically it must always produce artifacts always remove artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never be the effect of the unsharpness. for the Viennese filter it can never be at least just as good as the unsharpest mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better at processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below, you can see a comparison between different filters, applied on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear colour picture has to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to sufficient light for auto focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The control of the system sets the unsharpness of the area that was darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour tinte allows a adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-desired artifacts with unprecedented levels.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">In case you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail: p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smooth glass of smooth and details. a value of 0.9 should have that no sharpening is needed, that no sharpening is necessary to be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Coefficient dependency alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions, whereas a value is near 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will generate a high level of wave-like pattern. JPEG Artefacts will be best at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this puts the maximum glitter factor above all. p then defines the relative humidity. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeats: returns as often the algorithm. usually 1 or 2 is usually enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angled stepping ranges from [5, 90]: angle dependant integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, it should be small as well. be sure to create small angle a long runtime. you should therefore choose this value to be the widest possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepper size [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more to quality you get through the selection of this option is only minimal. it doubles the duration. therefore we recommend it to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons saving as and loading exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below, you can see how image errors will be removed with small artifacts. the module is used in a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. the original picture is caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; rocket production is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove spots and other artifacts, e.g. from dust or hair, to remove. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been done with a digital camera and an high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grain size that can be removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the underwindow details and the underwindow advanced settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. great values increase the time that filters per pixel can be applied and the image is smoothed through the radius and the color in it becomes smoothed and so that smaller flaws were cleaned.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpening unit. this value sets the pixel distance between the filter, and if it is increased, you will need to readjust the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and rushing or lubricating again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the edge. this value increases the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, cannot be removed all the noise or noise-tops can occur. put it on a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak room or JPEG Artefacts without any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance, to improve a picture. these settings will not affect the performance process by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance, to improve a picture. these settings will not affect the performance process by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the game tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically arys stronger, but also the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the pherd absorption. this value is defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges may appear. if it is too high, can remove rushing and phasenjitter on the edges. he can remove noise-pointed and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and store: these buttons are used exactly. all parameters are used for rocket production which you have set, can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original picture is marked with (1) and that was corrected using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to make the picture a bit soft, is thankfully much simpler than one image. use this tool to make the plasticist on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this surgery on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digipiers; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photartefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to emerge in digital, original or subsequently digitised images in digital, original or subsequently digitised images along the picture contours and thereby receives the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texturation. the algorithm with another tool, the image defect, is performed. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frann.2 and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas, even very far from it. as a lossless compression squot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are visible in uncompressed image. this attitude should be correct.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons saving as and loading exactly this. any adjustment of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still be very long and a high CPU load after itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below, you can reduce the picture of a photo with parfÃ¶rmiges. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (TM) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can recognize the notorious film grain on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and that corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for the photo restoration. this time, textures can be found on an old color photo that has been read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts from the scannerlighting and the photo paper. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; mold Hotpixel allows to remove hotpixel photos from the camera with a CCD camera, eight were used. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are especially high-quality raw material shots a problem, as many cameras have JPEG compression above a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot;" bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark subtracting method. there is now no manual method to choose the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to use the image directly inside the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD dedefects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correct image. please note that the assistant notices the last dark image and reloads this automatically in the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image field and preview can help you correct the result. the presentation window shows the output of the filters with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all predefined areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the Filters. select the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcutting: an average of the neighbor-pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defectives in a block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels, which have a distance from 1 pixel block, are drawn up to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixel's pixel.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixel with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, due to a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original picture has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitizer; Vignettierungscorrection is a tool to correct the viability, i.e., to correct corners.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, particularly in the medium and large photo format, can often be lit up the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture, by reducing the light the sensor there. TeleObjectives also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has drawbacks. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should be, even with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise irregular effects can be created by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's filtration and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by emulate a equivalent transformation to a rough image that is used without this filter. the algorithm uses an Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulator, you can control the Vignetmask-correction filter and with three more exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light tonic cushioning at the point of the largest density filter. the default density amounts to 2.0, or randomly to compensate with an optical thickness of 2, or randomly to compensate the density for a larger degree of vials, reduce it to compensate a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchintensity, Contrast and Gamma Settings: the editing of a image with Vignettting correction reduces the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls provide only positive values, as you have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more subtle change of exposure of the target picture, let the values for luminescent thickness / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digitilt; image processing of the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on a picture. the original picture (1) shows the correct picture in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a Leuchord and Counterfcorrection was also done in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lentil distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses in photos. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. colourless distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree is treated, the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third-degree has a similar concentrate effect, but flattened to the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth-degree angle corrects the remote corners of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally: this value controls the strength of the second-grade order. with negative values, tons-shaped distortion can be corrected and positive values are cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth-degree. this value looks more strongly in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the reverse number of parameter general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value is re-scale the image size and leads to a correction first by. negative values enlarge during positive the picture.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighter: this value is adjusted to the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values improve it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview of the correction correction. the values you are using for your image, are stored and the next start as standard values are used.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons or cushion-correction should be carried out before all the cutting or size changes. in case you perform this correcting as all the first. if you can rearrange a picture and then carry a tons-shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong of False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction you can find this tool a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move it to an important place, like the ocean side or a building screen, in your image and press the left mouse button in order to fix the lines at this point. in the connection, you can correct the tons / cushion distortion with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove this with the cut tool in the menu transformers or remove from the image processing or over the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tons-shaped correction came from. the next logical step for some motives, such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective so that you keep the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tons-shaped correction to a church in Norway. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate Infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website that can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 IInfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can add two parameters to simulate film gradation and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controls changes the quantity of the film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter image used on a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original picture is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the finishers.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digipiers; filter film grain is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, to enhance the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers of the photographic body of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film rate effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, road photographic, grainy appearance, especially into your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film critic inside a black / white picture applied. the original picture is the (1) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil paintings. it uses an uristic legal algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil paintings. nature paintings and styles are well suited for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper chooses the brush size between one and five. thick brush are better suited for large pictures. smooth the smooth or, from the other side, the charms.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil paintings effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and this is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel screen size is 1 and plain 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digipiers; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to create a coal cartridge. therefore, pictures of their gradients are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjusted the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon sign filter. the original picture (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug, filter engraving marks your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug, filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, moveable landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to set the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: share the image in cells and look like if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelength 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1, the image is distorted with another version of glass-blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using unsharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom sharpen: wipes the image along the crop-shaped lines starting from a centre. this simulates a zooming camera and produces a dynamic expression of often in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial sharpen: wipes the image by rotating the pixel to a centre. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distances: swiss the picture around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to occur in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement sharpen: wipers the image by horizontal movement of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft tissue: wipes the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny smooth focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating a romantic portrait, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk solids: wipes the image by chance shift the pixel and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent unsharpness: finds the color basin in the picture and caught this without the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and is then created by the colt with an average pixels value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make shelves on your picture. thus, it gives natural your pictures a good appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of the drops. since the drop-size does not automatically increase the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish does change the optical effect of drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digiplug; image editing a range free of shelves. use the range of tools to stay freely. if you start to run the shelves, the area will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelves. the original picture (1) shows a peaceful sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, so you can bring it through mirroring or rotating in the right direction. the tools you can find in the menu transformers and transforming spider.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools in order to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you obtain a picture and keep the details sharply? how can you find the missing information or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here is a good job here. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformer size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size can change an linear interpolation method to eliminate the pixels. if you want a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to blow.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. split interpolation for the increase of a picture. & digitization; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retained aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the entry of the new size is preserved the aspect ratio of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons saving as and loading will be used exactly. each entry for photo can be saved as text file, and later reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very quick with what it makes, but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load after moving. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating, by adding a small color picture on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of the linear standard penis comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequent operation, but also a frequent tool to put together a picture. in order to cut a photo with the mouse, simply press the rectangle with the mouse, pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you get rid of the mouse button, the area of the photos will be cut off. this allows you to change a good review like your photo after cut-up. you can create the size of the cut-up by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by pushing it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button 1 button of image processing in the tool bar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file store or file store using file to store the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the pretext area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialogue remains.</seg>
<seg id="644">In accordance with aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in high-format, the larger value of height and width is assigned to the width of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a single aspect ratio. that means it is always equal, regardless of whether you can see inches, inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically mark the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below, you can use the Max. ratio knob to the area for cutting on the widest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool according to aspect ratio stores its settings depending on the aspect ratio (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are mirrored the image and not the original picture.</seg>
<seg id="649">Enabling assistance to help, assist you to put together your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic particles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-reins, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similar harmonious triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a dividing to various natural growth pattern, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times if you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden middle. a composition that is usually followed as a visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center puts liquid aid lines at your disposal when you set up a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring good results to your target. compared to third-thirds, the golden spiral produces a smooth line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the rectangles of the golden spiral, even golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to direct the golden spiral. it may be a line, or different objects. this one can just be there without the eye, it will fulfill his job.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles is also discussing the golden spiral. their failure points are the middle points of the sides of the golden frame. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equiscuous triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame around your frame, create an effect from professional photography, dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. on this type, you can adjust the color of the lines your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it's easy to keep the camera horizontally horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which the things are shot at an angle. you can repair this with the & digiplug; image editing and the tool-free rotation. select Transforming free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are set in degrees. with the button preferences you can set the blade back to 0 degrees. a preview of the window is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is provided with a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointing out in the image preview to fix it over an important point of the image. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After filming an image, you'll find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. possibility to repair it, it is the function transformation to utilize cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cut out. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after turning. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectivan transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares on the corners of your image. the preview of the dialog is calculated automatically. on the right-hand side of the dialog box you will find some information to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas produced by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas produced by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degree at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degree at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: shows the current angle in degree at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective the picture becomes somewhat lost. for individual adjustment, this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes on the corners. one possibility to transfer this is the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The device tool is used to shift a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite image. this is no rotation, the image is distorted to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can launch this module via transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you push the horizontal angle, press the angle to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be shown right from the pattern.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have done the draining, the picture becomes a bit caught. for a single shot, this effect is usually negligible, but two corturing is twice as much swiss and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After crossing the picture has the picture of unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is the picture with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digipadded; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write in some cases, depending on your system and, in some cases, from the type such as these libraries compile, you will edit a large number of picture formats with & digiplug.</seg>

<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can use a background color for the chosen video format. with this module, it is possible to use the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the pictures into the mpeg-bags. after that, you can create the module via Extras maschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there, you can also change the pictures or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should select the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">Next step, you should specify the time in seconds the picture will be displayed. the speed of the image is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, very smooth, very smooth.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave them black. the name and the path of the generated file can define it under the name of the mpeg output file. keep it possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the film. once you can upgrade all settings to your computer, you can now be able to drink a coffee at the speed of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer, you can enjoy a coffee and enjoy the handkerau when you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer assistent allows several pictures on a sheet of paper together in standard photoggles. the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: sensible to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">Using this KIPI module, you can import / convert your stored images in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original port of Him is not expect from dcraw that it creates the same results as the software from your camera makers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted, and launch the module. the Raw image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings can be used for the White. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers may be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can continue to edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays right and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you have to edit your images frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format, as it's only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a disk format, metadata files will be stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file stored in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings you can start with the knob button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking machine mode allows you to convert different images on one time. so, use this mode, i.e. by testing on a single picture which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, this is helpful if this has been created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview of progress is not available. progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the image from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all images of an album. you can use the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the time to be used.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the image program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce the image and enlarge. these are four types of the image change available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. width or height of the image will be automatically selected, depending on image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for instance to adapt your picture to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>

<seg id="877">Don't pay attention to many images at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. its configuration is stored and each time used until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you'll need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you need to install the GMailAgent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file the comments to the pictures into a text file is joined and the mail included.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG, if you have a fast internet connection and should not be changed the photo quality. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and select the original files in JPEG format, the original output data will be added to the displayed photos.</seg>

<seg id="885">After starting the module's Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to display your slide show. you can choose between you selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation use very elegant image transfers by OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphics card, otherwise the seashau is very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name files ensures that the file name is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop provides the loop that will display the presentation in an endless loop. you can then roll off manually with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option is randomly chosen to select the images displayed in a random order, so it will not be the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the pictures, the temporal distance between the frames can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should show it out before you show your friends presentation!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly chosen in each transition between the images an other effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the seashau you can access a toolbar on the top left side. move the mouse into this corner to switch off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the seashau.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left bottom of the screen, you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date is currently no documentation. if you are interested, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI teams under KDE-imaging @ kde.org. attention: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the user interface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the current selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenue, as the background for your KDE-Work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have added your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & kphotoalbum; see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, you are now in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories, for which you have entered information when you have read your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk and, of course, view the current role models. in the following is described each for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both persons are visible. by this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the characters, places and other settings, you can display with preview images to view the images of your efficiencies.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. however, you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, it is also true for locations, keyword and other categories that you have defined. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display pictures beside the names, select the button, which is on the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of people and simultaneously a list of sample letters (if you don't have a suitable image for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, define what image for each individual will be displayed. to view this, you must select the picture image window (described in detail) and select the picture for the corresponding person. in the Affiliate window, you can select the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will be displayed and cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you are searching for entry in the main window, a dialogue will be displayed, which is very similar to dialog for determining the image properties. this dialog can be viewed on the image yet again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labelling or description, the labels and descriptions of the pictures are searching for this text. if you want, you can also be a date of the total data, i.e. example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, on which Jesper is depicted, however, not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like reading handbooks, but rather want to try out functionality, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and check out the quick, screen photos and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog box, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu help you select the menu entry into photo album; you will then get some sample pictures and you can test the features of & kphotoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the home page of & kphotoalbum; as an interconnected HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom edge of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this corals you see here:. as the name suggests, this surrounds you display data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline is able to interactively use the following ways: you can change the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, the timeline is always displayed the current date of the currently displayed images if you will navigate in preview charts.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the time data. if you select a range, only pictures of this period are displayed. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; built-in version you can create via the HTML menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you will need to make some settings. these are split into the three areas of content, layout and destination. in the following, each section will be described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overlook and a description, which is intended to contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML-example pages you can see an example of this settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum; -Export file is to be created on the overviews page. nourish information about export files you'll find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select what information on the HTML page are to be displayed. so, you can avoid that information is displayed without a description. for example, that all pictures are exported from a party. at the moment, you can't use this setting to hide certain pictures from particular viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can define how to look at the HTML page. most of the settings are clear, why this is not specifically made here.</seg>
<seg id="923">Below the page you can adjust various resolutions for the pictures. as a result, those who have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. thus, it can browse your pictures with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time, browse. if he want to get a picture larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting range, specify the different folder and URL, where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Most of all your HTML files choose a base file and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your pictures are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically select for any future pictures. here you can either select a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if you're really looking for a URL. if you choose a URL, a web browser, after the pages have been created, should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">In the case that the HTML files you do not have to copy it manually. in order to copy the import function, see, right, you need to specify the final goal of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolder are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described application options have referred all three based on basic file and URLs. in these, a subfolder, whose name you define in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may, of course, want to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures, reception, etc. to add, then you'll have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work is not even once.</seg>
<seg id="932">Using & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import other files into your database. image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file whether the pictures itself is stored in the file, or whether the file can be stored in the file, that you can have all pictures together and share this file so independently. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the pictures in two ways. first, the images are found in the .kim file. if the images are not found, the images of the URL, which you have created with the creation of HTML files, will only be possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue for export images is described, which you can export the file via the file... call.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether there is to be internal or external .kim files. the following three selection options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the Manually option to copy the .kim file, you will need to copy the pictures into the same file as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically to copy the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not able to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limited maximum image size. if you want to send your friends picture, you want to limit the images maybe not in full size, as the .kim file would be very big. here, you can limit the size that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import... select, will import & playback database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import is made of four steps. first you need to select which pictures you want to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you are calling the Category individuals to impose the file (if you are a Dane), while this category is called upon your database. therefore, you will be imported in the third dialog window, which should be imported into the categories of the imported file, and what categories do they represent in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can balance the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse pictures and look at: if you see images, you often want to view images from your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures shown on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will see the different steps taken from (1) determining the information on your pictures, above (2) the searches and look, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. however, it was extended and today your videos will take care of. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this is also videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all his information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their pictures. this is a simple XML file that you can copy with a program of your choice, such as Normal backup tools, back on a disk or revisions in the CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder in which your pictures are saved and use this at future Starts automatically. if you want to read another folder with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; using the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry settings the photo album; set up... enter a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual will be explained to you the various setup possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, which allows you to access the options and options for the viewer. for each setting, an extensive help is available, you can access the F1 key and click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described as you can define various features for each image, such as persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see dialogue, which is used to handle already existing groups. for any existing group you can select a labelling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in dialogue options, you can set up complete members of the members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a midglican.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of subordination, you can select the setting options available to you. with the above select list, you can select the category you want. in the left window, a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; it shares his modulation system with other graphics applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & KDE; Image Plugin Interface. navie information about this you can find on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can be accessed via the modules. modules can not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules yourself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it can be that the modules use with & kphotoalbum; you should always use new modules using the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu help. do not say, I wouldn't have been warned!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI have been very different, making it be very different, making some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their pictures in albums: this kind of order is not supported, simulates the order for some modules, so that you can use the functions using & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">To simulate the photo album; the current album, which is simply the current view, i.e. all the pictures that show you the picture shows at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum, modules also have to pass a list of albums. here's the photo album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example, all persons, then every entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category which you have specified in the dialog dialog as category for virtual albums, so if you are using the category characters, you will be selected using a photo album, so if you choose to view it and give it to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. please select the setup dialog, and select module, which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example for a start screen when you start & kphotoalbum; starting with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, you can see the window with which you can browse your picture database. at the moment we will not see any information about your pictures. in the section we will display on this window, but now click here to show you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any image with notes on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images to be shown simultaneously. if, for example, Jesper is illustrated and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All of these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in section. if you want, you can see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text box by offering people, places and keyword. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can always use them again, when you type information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the shifting of images within the list: if you have a family party and shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 people can be shown, so that the names used by the names are postponed, the people can find faster and allocated.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get a alphabetical list below, click on the icon for sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image, you might need to edit all selected images and have these images with notes. in this case, just click on the button and back buttons that are located under the preview of the image right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and select the menu option more than a note on once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all listed in the United States. besides San Francisco and Los Angeles, California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the House Supplements, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. additionally, you can also put an entry into a category and add it to a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the template dialog by setting the glue that form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window by pulling him outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options..., which offers you the possibility to store the current construction and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also check out a frame completely. if you want to display this window later, use the button options... and here then window / trigger. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the record images in your browser, you'll get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all pictures if you do not have filters. an example of this you can see here. you can try the size of the preview of mouse, by simply pointing down pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you set a picture on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in the picture. if you do not have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding pictures you want to erase and select either the Remove button or select the Edit menu. now, you will see the window displayed in the image.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; you can also use a solution for this problem. you can also use the pictures anywhere without having stored on the hard disk. of course, you'll have to record the pictures anywhere, so you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures of the hard disk can be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures where the right corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, images are present, making & kphotoalbum; you can see the preview of this picture. however, you can also watch these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it again. if you want to avoid the insertion of the relevant CD until now. if you like trouble, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want to stay a little more privacy, you filter the pictures so that at the end of those you want to open for others and click on top view menu. alternatively, you can also see all the pictures you want to see and pick your little sister.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have set what images should be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you want to unlock the images of your little sister, simply select the menu entry, see the images that you want to display, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered, to unlock the images. in order to establish this password, simply select password change in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection cannot be safe if you can find all pictures on the hard drive and to others, any one can read or delete the password as unencrypted text, or delete this type of password protection. this type of password protection has only to be familiar with those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to spoil the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to manage all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; it is natural for you to describe them sometime. for this reason, you'll have to look at some point. for this reason, the photo album features a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview of how described.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows of course the picture, but additional all information you use about the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the top part of the picture you want to see, you can easily configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. that then, you can see the text-text menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click on this browser, see, matching entries at this point. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have several pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and return back by using the keys image high and image down. you can reach the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run these as Diashau. if there is a new picture after a few seconds. how often it can press a new image by pressing the Ctrl button and Plus or minus the button and stopped the seashau by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of viewing of & kphotoalbum; is it in fullscreen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to change in fullscreen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you can use the viewer in the image and zoom out. with the mouse, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse button. the Plus key zoomt is shown in the middle of the image and shows the result of the zooming.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the recolitaste the zooms, so each pixel is equivalent to a pixel's pixel screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zooming operations that work in videos that are in and zoom out with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the shooting functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. you can't work with videos. you can make notes on the current picture with the menu entry notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures you can see a picture with a person whose name you will have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view the viewing and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you'll probably prefer to mark the picture and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to launch the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you'll see one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the viewer viewing the opportunity to see images with traits while viewing them. features are the letters A-Z and you can press a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. see a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have any attributes added to your pictures, these are available in your browser. so, you can see all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, so you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you can view the categories in Dre preview, then you can press features to the picture by simply press the letter for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you will allow you to paint a photo album; on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted will not be saved with the image, but in the database. on the type you can reversed your talent later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In a picture you can see a picture on the painted. to put the painting from the text menu. to put the painting out of the text menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar top at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">In order to work with & kpovmodeler; you have to work on the application of the program & Povray; not fully-master, but the documentation on & Povray; you should not have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the property-tree you can select individual objects. then, the properties are displayed in the object properties and shown the object in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select several objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are fles possible positions, the following menu will be displayed, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar, or from the right-text menu to the right mouse menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changes properties, click on Apply to take advantage of these changes. if you have invalid values, a message will be corrected with a error message. then you can correct the input error, click on application or disrupting the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; file documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download them here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you are making a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview in the Economic View Viewing View.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a look ahead in the future view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. if you want to select a subordinated element, even if you want to rename a part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross locally.</seg>

<seg id="1024">If a transformation is selected, the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model. this cross marks the centre for scaling and turning as well as position for shifts. you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visual performance. you can specify this value relatively to the level of level or as absolute value. objects are only displayed if they are selected or their level of level smaller or equal to the visual display of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object-tree and the view of the object properties will be displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window settings, or if you need a different arrangement, you can also store them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a separate view, drag the attachment to the upper or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the attachment to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to arrange several views over each other, drag the attachment to another view. you can then switch between the views through clicking on the map posts up in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order rules are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, drag the attachment to the desktop or click on the small upward pointing arrow in the attachment bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the collection bar. to prevent the loop, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the menu view, you will find entries for any type of views. new views are webbing, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can rendering them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be installed properly. as this manual is written, was & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the symbol Rendering the symbol rendering in the toolbar, or select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert many Render modes, from a quick preview of up to the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the symbol The Render, or in the toolbar menu, or in the menu view Render Modi... choose the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to rendering a small area of the image, choose the crossword section and enter the image section to rendering in input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can select the features that uses & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties will be found in the User manual & Povray;</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture contains just a beam of pixels, different errors can be created. these images often have a moirÃ¨ pattern or studs effects in bends and lines, and sometimes details are not shown if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this defect. in general, pictures with this feature better look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn back anti-aliasing, calculates and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; recursive, because each pixel is constantly divided again and adaptive because every pixel depends on the calculated depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray works a beam each pixel. if the difference between the color values will be processed and then both pixels will be calculated with the tracking of a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the lowest value on 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated with an extra value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixels, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue in the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixel which can be followed individually and checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recusion can be adjusted with depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is reducing the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams of a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray which calculates diffuse light reflections. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can set if the alpha channel should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object taken.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opening a new window for viewing the & Povray; file output. if & Povray; unexpectedly, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; file to import, select the file entry file import... and select a file from the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command set of & Povray;. if when importing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can move objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code to import file in the Editor. to import objects into the scene, select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object-tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene rendered. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the aid view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. here you can find the path to your copy and the version. support versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can adjust the points of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can adjust the grid, separate for shifts, scaling, and turning.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus a better approach to the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the high details on advanced projections, all wire model views will be further divided into the camera. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall will be displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the bottom, one floor underneath the objects is rendered. the floor will be displayed in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you want to activate the check rates, the non-recursive antialiasing method used for rendering scenes. values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more precise information about parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window directives. in the section window orders are explained, as you can create and store instructions.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop-down menu arrangement: displays all existing window frames. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can add and delete a selected arrangement with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the chosen window order. new views can create and delete the button, and remove selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unting board the window under the existing window, with box map you get a view of card view together with the previous view and webbing. view not in main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now want to start without further knowledge of the two programs. if you can create all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain about that you use as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not adjust camera, no rules for rendering are applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't add light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will receive a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything wrong, see the first startup of & kpovmodeler; the following preset windsettings are:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so that you can get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">These menus and symbols are often used right now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees all the scene you produce. in particular, you notice the view from the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the scene of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The property-tree now includes a new entry with the designation camera. if you click on it, you'll see the content of the view characteristics to find the various parameters of the camera. in the User Documentation & Povray; please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera can change in view points, with which you can change the camera's target. simply click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired spot.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you push the button Apply or SINGABETASTE, the wire model views and the property-tree are changing immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera here.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you might add a cube (inserting final body quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that's an awkward way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or SINGABETASTE. in the property tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model list now shows the level, even at the moment only as a limited level. if you rendering the scene, the plane stretches out to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you can check out the object tree, you will find that you click on the item + before the object. in this case you can only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the bottom to the practice a unit below the horizontal line, just so that you should know some of these parameters. select shift and put the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to set out his material characteristics. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialogue in which you can select how the object is added. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the objective view (name = Floor pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of Pigments only features a Mattes black material because you can still have settings for the pigment still. do not think that you can check the look of the materials anytime with a click on a preview of view. now, there are many possibilities for the pigment. again, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on Quader and sphere, click on the button Apply and then click the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you rendering your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, you are not the color list you've expected. here are further settings needed. in the color list you need to select two new attributes. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this page more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the property-tree every time imaginable and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to run this step as you model the basic methods of & kpovmodeler; you already understand. the ball can be just as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the SINGABETASTE or the button Apply), so the ball would stick over the floor, because you have shifted the floor for a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering is now a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a Mattes black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the sphere, you can now indicate a material. like the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose erotic object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click "" "" Pigment, select "" "" Encolored "" "" and put the values as follows: "" "</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach an interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on Apply or press the ONE GABETASTE.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The attitudes of gloss effect and reflection has already shown partly good visual effects, perfectly suited for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: even not selected is:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of which options you & kpovmodeler; yet. hopefully you've learnt so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which reflect the scenes) by every pixel's perspective, which reflects the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources can be used. so the scene pixels is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you'll see nothing, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source, you see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, any scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default dialog box, you can select a file that you've done before using & kpovmodeler; created</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open a new model or create, insert the file into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. is it a new file, you need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">The scene is reproduced in the last stored release. all changes have been discarded since last saved.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry, if you don't have any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeats the most reversed command. select this menu entry, then select, if you use editing options.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialogue in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement, or write a existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keynote and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify the short commands for & kpovmodeler; add commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Open a dialog to set up the tool bar. you can add and remove toolols for & kpovmodeler; add commands and remove.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-Map is an option to prepare rough surfaces, without requiring any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these plots. these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base, by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& ball-show; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in your own window, in the size of the image or in fullscreen mode.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists and scripts. an example call for the COP function could be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports command-line options of Qt and & KDE; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use the dialog, so that the user is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Start the 'Corundum' Resandum 'Resundum (KDE binding for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is Required for this script.' dialog --sorry '# {error}' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts scripts / templates you will find a lot of submission scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply use them to expand the required functions. you will quickly find that writing of scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP you can exchange your scripts with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; the use of each KDE installation should lie.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow external programs and commands to execute external programs and commands. in this way, dcop &gt; can be accessed relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends alerts to all current scripts. in this reason scripts will be able to monitor their standard input and respond appropriately to events. of course, a script may also ignore the events if there is no use for this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the setup dialog. if a script is started, Amarok sets the file folder on the folder, where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script might now query & zb; with DCOP functions ask further information about the new piece (for example, metadata or the denomination).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change of volume. the volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customization: submenu itemTitle, Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist. to add a user defined menu entry, you can use the DCOP function dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove dcop amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; stop or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do e.g. recording studios, such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that can be compressed using a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar-archives (.tar) which can be used as well as bzip2 (.bz2), so the user can clearly recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension catokscript. for this reason you should rename your script packages immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main release must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>

<seg id="1243">AmaroK requires only the Package Kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you need to have Kdelibs so installed (including those included programs, because & amarok; requires some of them to find modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile Kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD are predicting that your window managers support the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work for example. we try to assist amaroK on all platforms, so we use Kdelibs and Qt, because these places an excellent development environment.</seg>

<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the somewhat more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional scope, so your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the accompanying programs do you give.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you can use the command line program dcop. to make use of the & DCOP; functions need to make sure that & k3b is started. then give something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions, all & KDE; -program common, supported & k3b; mainly two other parts, which are described below.</seg>

<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coders and compression rates, and helps you choose the right codierers.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format needs to be lost. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorts' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are small compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit rate (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important as both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to high quality sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality in deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009, these devices are supported only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting makes good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset Standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 - 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approx. 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of the title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of the title. good Genug for music from young people, portable devices and auto-stereographic systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insulane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most persons and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute top quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which are taken manually or by the program automatically fetched from the FreeDb via the internet are available as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudioCreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names, as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodierprograms there is often a combination of program settings for the coders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coders explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title Parameters of & kaudioCreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the FreeDb is: a free database, in which people can download the information, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of yourself in the machine. it is to be considered that here only one text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so the information cannot be added to the artist or CD; more or less worthless, so all information can be obtained in a bumblebee by a & CD; shop, physical or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; active is active as an address box (sending an address). for the use of FreeDb can be used with another (fake) address, so it seems, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving data from server (This can only know the programmer who has reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are in many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudioCreator; for use of FreeDb, the geographic is needed to use the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and compares the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflections on the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, you can download the complete database or (usually created monthly) only the updates on the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which evaluation program is used to store pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know it more precise, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s to be aware that the cdparanoia package should be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the regular WAV files, the code reader can be selected as a file format for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compressing for audio data) on the tab of the Kodierers. other coders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution, before the coders can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined code. additional information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welter Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installation of a codierers, more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). 'lame' will be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device of the device model of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, FLAC & etc;), try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could indicate what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; read the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step for example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, everything understood, but somehow still unsafe to do something? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will set up the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) ranging from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as a precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as a non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source file, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have screamed on it (eg; by copying the conqueror something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section handles the basic set-up of & kaudioCreator;, something that is supposed to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the action to read a & CD; what must be repeated for any lashing & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the content code for compression of the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 - 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program using the FreeDb program to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Even though we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to read out a & CD because once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device model is handed over to the program program that it can read & CD; data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom a symbolic link to the actual device-name of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the CD-ROM and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The General Settings menu. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be displayed / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if incomplete information is inquiring, so that you will be informed when information about the survey by keyword (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The box CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloadable via the Internet from a FreeDb machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected during reading the & CD; connected to the Internet, so that it can access the FreeDb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, is a & CD; record found immediately, when you're unhappy with the database entry and the folder name directory, file name and file name, you can change easily and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & KDE; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to set everything manually, turn the select box and FreeDb. however, you can download it twice as if you want to download the database before. however, this is more than 620 MB of size, if you have to be selected, the two box office must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following board map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is available for us FreeDb. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from FreeDb server via the Internet. how can the system know which data will be the CD? read the section about FreeDb. put everything as shown in the screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look at a mirror-server nearby. on this way, the load between the machines is distributed. however, this setting will work as first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as there are many firewalls the protocol 8880 as standard, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to transmit any & CD; data to the FreeDb server will suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel to read and encode? the author don't know it, so simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: cross this to the & CD; throw at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined file for temporary files: when you cross this, then the path / folders can be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not required, the files will not be displayed in the private folder. don't forget that folder, if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All you enter like it is on screen photo. the command is somewhat long, under circumstances, something has to be blown to a right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the record '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of the tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can be erased if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & KDE; in case of subsequent alteration of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the names of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest like in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: at a dualcore or square or even a multiprocessor machine can be tempted to encode more than a WAV file.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD comes out on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is set up and set up in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from FreeDb is to pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any extended & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; you do not have a bit different from freezb, you see the screen photos a bit different than those for a & CD; with successfully delivered by FreeDb. therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually select from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, such as in screen photo. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not happening, then you are searching for questions and answers from the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched the FreeDb, all tracks are already filled out, and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; gives, a window appears, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the checkbox for the automatic query of FreeDb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings) you can manually trigger your local database, but select the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entering the CD Data and the title of the first unit</seg>
<seg id="1584">Specify the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be entered in the input field 'Updated title', unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidivell pro piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply together for all the tracks of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the FreeDb the CD editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor, so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names (for example, if all words are beginning with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you have ID3v2 tags; this option is set up on the code map settings; take a look inside the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all Kodians and file formats. see in the help of the codiers to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select one entry, which is obviously matched with the style of the permitted CD; this example is not important as we don't transmit the & CD; file data anyway. for more information, go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor appears again and you can see that the fields are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply type entries for the fields of the current piece. specify the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and process the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from FreeDb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the tool bar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before any line of a piece. only the title is selected as selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or click on the button. select all the pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the button selection, read the read process, this window appears on confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders for switching on the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you're trying to work with a coaster that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not successfully encoded using a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the file for the TMP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have a write access to the file for temporary files and target files?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the first piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. you can read and encode the status below in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and coding. with powerful machines, the calculator with a amd64 seems to have no problem with simultaneously reading and encode (of however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the final title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the Kodierers. after the last piece is encoded, a small window is embedded for a short period in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator;, you need & KDE; 3.x or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the code of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading right? even if only the help menu has been clicked on the first start of the program, without any indication of this somehow empty screen (especially when there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What's all about? if you read this, probably the program has started. it should look somehow like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no email. the author can't stop this manual. it's as the first version to add or change it, may it do. at least after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has understood this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when it has been able to get the source file from the & KDE; SVN, then you don't need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the Midi- and Karaokespieler of & KDE; besides others he has a real-time graphics and karaoke-real highlighting of texts also some properties, the other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & KDE; support & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is required for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequenzer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the song text on the screen with changing color, so it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic presentation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the impressive buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can go into & KDE; each MIDI-file from a & conqueror; -windows to move on KMid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). KMid automatically determines the procedures used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you finish & KDE; while playing a song, KMid starts with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First you can open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also have a file from a & Konqueror; -window in the & kmid; -window drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and get the knob button in the tool bar, choose the entry-play from the menu piece or reset the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will start automatically once you move it onto the & kmid; window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump at any point by using the medium mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow down, you can click on the arrows on the left and to the right of the speed display and change the speed speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar, like a print on the button pause or select the menu option, interrupts the reproduction. if no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use textures, others use lyrics and again other both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set up what events are supposed to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined that you have to set a song automatically. if you have selected the URL Settings menu, you will always have the opportunity to change this if you want the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set out an event type, choose from the menu settings the entries of text events or song events. the same feature also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played in turn. in this section, how you can use the collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To set a collection, first open the Collection Manager. please visit the menu collection below the point.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then indicate the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set up the entries in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">Into the temporary collection, all songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. remember, if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected at the Collection Manager. there, you can add a song again with the knob. it appears again the file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic Add to the collection is enabled, a piece with opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will be added automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you will need to open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on the removal.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the series from the sub-menu setting of the menu collections, the songs will be played in order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list on the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back to a song, select the button foreword, the entry previous piece from the menu piece or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the Collection Manager, select the collection of delete collection, and click on the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, that doesn't matter if it is stored at leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is necessarily necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map general-MIDI events in events that the synthesizers understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano as such as Change patch to drunket and thus always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the respective file from hand (with your favorite gate).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary conversions for playing a piece of play.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section, which is as often as desired. premise for this is, however, that each of the occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as email, so I can use in future versions of & kmid; support can be designed for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches from General MIDI will be shown on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order and do not throw any line to one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to lay all sounds you need to lay on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun type. this includes the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (thumbago), Patch 100 (the drum at your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the term drum patch of the patch is meant by which every tone is a different percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one that means sound height of the same drum means (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how sounds will be shown on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence. thus, you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sounds on the perkine channel. look for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to shift the first and second channel, you simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (general MIDI channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is depicted on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, you will be sure to use the Keymap option. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, Patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the perkine patch on the perkine channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio will be multiplied in which ratio Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied and then forwarded with the value n * (r / 4096), and then the value of 4096 is used so that no decimal number is used in the Map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM provides that one keyboard, that gets a Pitch-Bender Event with the value 4096 to be able to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards by two sounds up to an octave higher. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you'll need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the Settings menu, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on this piano, you see what sounds are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't look green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canal view (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. view the menu settings below the point of view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace LCD displays speed, which is played a song. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music needs to be played. it contains the same MIDI file to two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes on a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer; you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control of everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support has been compiled. to download the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's')</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, activate the automatic setting for the collection. otherwise the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can get the arrow key left from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I've played on a & KDE; Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; in this mode I have to play a MIDI file (if I play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, merely go into the & Conqueror; -window change and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only if you want to add one to a collection, turn off the setting automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will add to the temporary collection. open from files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let us assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you want to play the first file. so make the setting automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains just this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have been sent to me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animated me to & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maresto; Laga. at the moment I'm not a lot of leisure for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time for my hobbies, but I try to show program MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you want a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write an e-mail: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really don't want to send me a postcard from your residence or a Midi- / karaoke file from a local group. all of whom you want to send a postcard or a MIDI file, but if you want to record a MIDI file, but you should contact me as I already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have posted & kmid; completely written in my spare time and I don't want to get tired of money. I would like to emphasize that I'm only so reprograme because / when I get back feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A soundcard. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, compile & kmid; compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is displayed if information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to enrich the preferred connections under the menu Bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category Durable playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchies. if you have a record, his group and all its subgroups are copied to the current category, and reproduction starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do if you click on a name in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer; to select from the menu view and next edit mode. by adding a subgroup, the XML content is displayed only.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, it must be selected from the menu with playlist and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes have lost, if the edit mode or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and moving may be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [general Options] No Intro = 0 above option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can easily be inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the tool bar of kmplayer. here is the output of MPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & kmplayer; everything must be configured by manual processing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example of how a flash card using the swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer only can use Xvideo, Xvideo should work also (probably this type of playing video equipment under Linux) is also supported. this is why the videoforlinux needs to be functioning for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must therefore be contained in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>

<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ 's command}) by & kile; automatically create a blank line (for example\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in the menu settings; set up... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; encourage the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most important and submartial element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structural view, the individual elements can be changed by a mouse click on the respective variety.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file [germany file format] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the respective row in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the format of the format and also other information, such as the font, or & latex; for example, there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; -files for various systems and systems.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the root search, the elements of the DVI; file with the editor of the PFT and once upon a element in the DVI; source code speculation. the premise is the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in the & latex; source code is clicked, becomes the appropriate spot in the DVI; -viewer injected.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this feature will be used with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified with other input .tex files simplified. in the use of a project, a project-wide master-document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there is no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "file sharing: in this mode the DVI; file on the so-called" "" "welder" "" "means and there is no call by & eyepiece; after the quick building." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">In view of the editing toolbar the three major components should be developed. the selection box is designed for the rapid support of common elements into the document. the first selection box is designed for the rapid differentiation of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The latex & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box for further products is available for items such as tags, joints, notes, or references. the possibilities offered are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command will create a section for a section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Regarding: is used for reference to a fixed label (select a selection box).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote is displayed a select list with literary entries. for the editing & BibTex; files are necessary editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib; the & BibTex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ Â¶ mere is used for the establishment of the Scriptures. it can be specified for the main text, the futher notes etc., there are the following font names:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; there are two selection options for making a new document by selecting the document art and proclaiming settings. 2. the document can be written by reason of this document.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets on the command\\ 'class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] lays down the fonts of the font. if the font is not fixed at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code has been entered, the & latex has to be compiled; source code compiled. the easiest way to use is the use of the menu or the drop of the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compile. & tile; for storing the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compile of the document fails, should be searched in the logging according to errors. when using quick construction, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">A environment (in English environment) is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document. for example, a report with the Scriptures should have been addressed. the command\\ 's {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} are also encouraged to maintain the persistence of the font within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The objections are defined only within the environment (of\\) {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restrictions (number) for subdivisions within a environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities for the literacy of the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, italics, substesses, etc are added to the end of the environment, either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">"" "\\" "" "emph}: this command is available for the course of the course until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented by a" "" "word}" "" "word" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ Quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ 's {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source code with the & latex; sign language is presented, then a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & khaste;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant, a bit text has been entered, a few adjustments should be performed for better legibility of the document. at this time, a quotation, a few places in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem for use are to be seen in order to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor's view or Ctrl e can be returned to the editor by editor-View or Ctrl E. at an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simple try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a large file format (engl. D e V ice I nered). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer monitors.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing one & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - you can then print the document (in the viewer), then the printer can be printed correctly (if the printer is correctly set).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool encourages the transformation of DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion can start to any other formats using the KnÃ Â¶ PFE in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The forwarding search encourages direct jump from the editor to add one position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding attitude for all & latex; -binary files. only Modern attitudes are set up with atile... tools Bauen.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the preferences, the mouse pointer has to be positioned in a line of the source code and close to premise. the jump to the respective spot in DVI; -viewer is then performed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the medium mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; file by & kile; used and specile; in & eyepiece; as text editor should be set (Settings... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using quick-building the & DVI; viewer can not be mentioned, an error may be preceded. if a mistake is required, this will be displayed in the log file, or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file provides the source source in the source code. in the editor, then the KnÃ Â¶ PFOX error and NÃ Â¼ chster LaTeX error has to be used in the error. in order to consider incorrect line, the error must be clicked on the error in the logging and haste; jumps to incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you clicked on the matching button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose the template's choice for the document. the most default mapping are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">Selecting the empty document a document may be used either by reason or the wizard for quick creation of a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">For example users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates in & kile; created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be generated or a new file. & kile; can create a new template by means of an existing document and choose from the template's template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document of a template, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in attitudes of tile... settings in general.</seg>
<seg id="1803">For creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables will be replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the input in document class. typically they will be used as follows:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to creating a template is the use of the assistant and that makes use of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created on this way, the following steps will be accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the template can be selected instead of the standard charms.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched, according to one in the Internet, and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; uses & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & BibTex;). many settings for & Kate can be made directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about Kate's and Kate, the Handbook to Kate will be attracted to Kate. users of & kile; can be addressed directly with the editor of & Kate's editor.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called for the menu of LaTeX reference. it contains almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use them as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click-click Ctrl button to remove the & tex; word for cooling. this means that this means when clicking on the\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text, with the lined linker, the full text will be automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys, you can find parts of the source code on the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse the most diverse types of source codes and emphasize this. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants like to collect dive marks. this is a number of bookmarks within the text. the menu entry is highlighted the leap to nettest or last jumping brand. this dive is also highlighted in the first entry of a drawing automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & kile; even though & Kate; important functions for writing a & latex; source material added. & latex; special commands for their selection. under editing are the following commands to add text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Does a complete paragraph (group of lines contained on both sides). this extended meaning is meant for tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only clear thing in & khaste; it is therefore that the downfall is separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">In case of the current cursor position, this is also an enlarged meaning, since this command also contains & latex; commands with a rinsulated star (\\) and a added star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For sharing a part of the document can be removed from this first and can be removed by pressing the button. & Kate; offers the key collection of Ctrl; K with the entire line is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands for a faster application. under editing, the following commands are available at the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete section. the definition of a section in & khaste; is included in the description of editing cooling sales.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clear that environments can play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for further orders under the editing environment for a very simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command is speckled in the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the command.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command is injected to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor or within the command\\ 's {surrounding} is located at the end of the surrounding area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering the input of many contaminated environment commands, this command can be lost quickly. this command is close to the last setting, so that the laced environment structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are destined for brackets {...}. edit TeX Group are a few important commands that comply with those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, the current group is injected (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly in front of the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, the current group is injected (no matter where the current position is). cursor will be placed directly behind the welded bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded bracket of a & tex; group # is injected to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many embellished groups-brackets can be lost quickly. this command will close the last group, so that the weaned structure of the & tex; groups cannot be distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple starting signs are used. for the purpose of the purpose, the character is used in & kile; the character is used. & kile; the sign will be used. & kile; knows this case and for two close directions for a latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic setting can set up the double starting point under attitudes of tile... LaTeX - and will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There are also other specific settings (such as nolls or French) and that in order to be used German or French positions. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">For shift from shift; ONE GABETASTE for & kile; an intelligent cell breaks. if the current position is located within a list environment (e. g. parade or itemize), there is not only one line breaks but simultaneously the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close within a tables environment, double & tile; the current line with\\\\ are starting with a decent line breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to emphasize preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. to set up this box under attitudes; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables-environments and all the emile characters (amp;) to arrange each other. if this tabulator is not possible, for example, if this tabulator is not added, however, to add & kile; there is some interroom for the columns to the current tabs.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate has already expanded a good source code, these are in & kile; in order to have special commands (mostly for & latex;) yet, there are three different modes as needed and the other two are available for automatic shift settings. all these modes are set up for different workplaces under attitudes of tile... Resurable.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When you start a new environment using the\\ 's {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surrounding} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When turning the button bar, the last letter of entry is removed and can be inned to the complete list. on the other hand, the list may also reduce the list by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be found in a selection of a command. alternatively, there is also a jump to these positions via Edit jump marks, denominated, and the desired parameters can be folded then.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under attitudes are haste; set up... chewing; fullsize settings for these lists. it can be used different scale lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as calf for the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not available for use of environments. there are always a few letters to be entered with\\ '. on the other hand, the environments will be used so often that & kile; create a special mode for fully operational environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the process mode, the reference mode or the keyboard is Alt + Shift key, the command will begin automatically and it appears\\ 's. afterwards, the environment will be carried out on the easiest way and can be terminated by using the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After having completed this, the environment will be closed automatically. once & kile, recognizes that it is a lists environment, will even be a first\\ item command with one's first\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under attitudes ile; set up... chewing; file settings for these lists. this mode uses the file list of the complete set mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; emphasize custom lists of abruptions, which are set up immediately by lapping character strings. as an example, the lists use example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and replaced by the word processor mode, or the key (Ctrl + old space bar), the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large number of washing machines are not helpful for the automatic failure. however, it has been determined that many boards have been written in a document more than once. thus, & kile provides the full service for all of them already written.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up in the quantity settings... Kile overlay down. here, the swelling can be specified for the display of the calculation.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS -files are not as known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and redirectives of pages. if the PDF output is added, the pages are arranged with a few & PostScript; tools are re-arranged and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To look forward to the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped in the menus for creating compile, creating converting and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or another conversion can be converted to the keyboard by old; 3 viewed, by old; 4 the DVI; file into a PS file, and by Alt; 5 the PS file is considered.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command quickset, a viewer is usually called to compile after compiling. if no one-bound viewer should be used, every time a new window will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will continue to project new project.... In the following information, the project will be questioned about the project:</seg>

<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created simultaneously (see below), downloaded, or created automatically from an existing DTD. see details for details.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. briefly, an & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Featuresdialoges, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags in a document without risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag file are nothing as a folder. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag file bear the name of the descriptive language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the tagXML and declare if they are necessary, or not all necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible, so that other users have better viewing and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all about the possibilities and limitations will be presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a day XML document. it can only be found in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but only element type over itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; a function of function. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day class. the name of the basic class for this class. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the Type Method. gives the name of the class to where this method belongs. (family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute and the attributes can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; -day. that's a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes a attribute of a tags. this element may only be for each attribute. it contains the name and type of attribute. additionally, it contains additional tags that should be shown as this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element -type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Is the source codes used for the attributes in the day-Editordialog, and the attribute-tree in the attribute-tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface is used within & quantaplus; it is used for reaching the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. dcop methodology name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a methodology name. the arguments that are passed to the method. can be empty or% day name%, that means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">One container tag contained the elements of a list together. it can only happen for an attribute description only once. it is a only element element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of attribute textures a tags within a dialogue. this day can only be found for each attribute in a dialog only once (for example for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Gives the position and the size of a field in dialogue. this day should be available for every field in dialogue (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Gives a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Gives a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All tagXML files must start with an & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be chased and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch out & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; Tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To review the tagXML files, the tools dialog above in the & quantaplus; window to launch and check the TagXML. a further dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the verification only takes place at the store of the TagXML-files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; -ELEMENT from the & W3C; & XML; file name. the file name for this tagXML file is supposed to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; Excel feature is described. the file name of this tagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just quite simple and there is an editor to be reachable via DTD edit DTD settings. therefore, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = turnaround 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD-indication (/ / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as Nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set up with attitudes of actions... click on New Action to the same dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action is assigned to the abbreviation button. with clicking the button user you can be assigned a keynote; with Kone the current button is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into a text in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. using the help of this promotion, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use as input (or parts of document), even are the quick start-up dialog or the various look in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed to use the% scriptance variable in command line, such as sh% scriptance / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable to be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced by the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file name: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the running & quantaplus; process is replaced by & quantaplus; it is useful when DCOP is used to control the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, normally the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be accepted at default. in the selection box, it can be determined to send the default entry. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually useful only with this attitude.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types issue: normal edition, written on the standard issue, error messages, which should be specified in accordance with the default text written, by setting the value of the selection box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add actions and configure. select settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add them to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should memorize the action with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represents, we will use & kettedit; choose from the & kmenu;, graphics and other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kettedit; used by default, 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select another size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, means, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually interpreted as los, starte, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user is signaled, that click on this symbol to insert a message; -Day in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be linked to the action. this happens via the menu with Settings... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder, where the stored symbol is, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, so it is still which, or do you confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar, or if it should be added to a better overview by some separator in several groups. open the toolbars to set up the toolbars, make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (right up) for my toolbar. after choosing the element, that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick opportunity to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner does not know the grouping. someone, who doesn't know my toolbar, could believe that the & Konqueror; knob the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by means of all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up in the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be stored in the correct folder, but your toolbars (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adapt their & descriptionrc, so that your tool bar (s) will be loaded, if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user you can add documentation for the script language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; -document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if anyone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. the first part is left to you, the second we treat you here.</seg>

<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents will be referenced directly to a file (and consequently, at the top end of the construction manager & mdash; file is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affecting nothing, but make sure & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateries will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content segment is the range of the docrc file, which should be shown to design of context-sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP; script for context-help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and save up to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global usage. then create a folder (such as you do this in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these good and well worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g., which documentation have been used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud of being involved in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the ressources of resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via e-mail to friends, partners or else. at different sites there is an email sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar toolbar with email, in context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script's tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, where all other & quantaplus; -users can be downloaded and only made available if our team need them to make use of the resources, where it ensures a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked by your Passphrase for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have several keys to pass. in the dialogue New resource may remain blank (URL preview can remain empty) and then click OK the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Upload the upload of the menu DTD DTD (DTEP) to upload, upload, toolbars, and folders in the templates and scripts in the templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before the installation, & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource is investigated. in the case of problems, it can be broken. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed, a message appears with the description of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, it may be time consuming, because hundreds of tag files can be necessary in the tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">Conversion can be started from the DTD store and convert a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with DTD description that should be used. afterwards the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folders.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE Definitive line: the string that should appear in! DOCTYPE day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, spit & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; Editor, with details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefit from & quantaplus; this chapter attempts to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; few benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project involved. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. by factory monitoring, everything is marked as globally, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be done all by & CSS; -patterns of up to tool bar with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simple, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which are the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorment, the Baumanners, the boxes, and the toolbars. please strike in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the boxes with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document, like close the current, other or all boxes, reload, erase or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Legal click in the Editorch section will lead to a further context menu regarding the appropriate document content (cut / copy / paste / paste), editing the file name, or open the file, if the string can appear under the mouse pointing one file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editorfensters are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard, for which one set of toolbars are shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars of the new functions are adapted to the new features and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, then click the icon, which is represented the day. now, you can add the data for this just one day. if you want to add a day that several attributes (such as anchor), you can add in a dialogue different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction site (QIT;) enable to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; navigate to navigate them and pass through. in the presentation of boxes, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation constructions are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool to provide & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload, or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; There are all possibilities open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working range. global Templates are always available, local templates for the corresponding users and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, additional functions are available, such as the script, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-click of a element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by right-click of a element, a list of commands opens in terms of navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other construction sites. with it, some attributes and namespace can change. this is possible to change the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for Web technology for your development. it can be downloaded from the quantaplus; you can create own documentation, and add a folder doc to a project can be edited and considered project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two box trailers at the bottom of the window can be achieved: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This box shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the DTD of the current document and all modifications to DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box shows all errors in the market up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (such as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the toolbar is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with an email. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as a compressed tar-archive via & kmail; if they get a toolbar in an email, you can back up and load them in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; file files to your system. for this, autoconf has given a number of options to get to the configure script. in order to get a complete list of all the options, type. / configure --help. options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starters of & quantaplus; you should check whether your path contains the & KDE; 3 bin file also. you should ensure that no older version of & KDE; 3 in PATH is present in front of her bin. same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; was optimized for a rapid web development and combined a mature development environment with a wide range of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While effort to create the best & HTML; Editor, developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extendable Markup languages? well, this would make him an absolutely amazing web development tool for & KDE; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; restricted, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. together, if you can define it in & XML; then you should use & quantaplus; for the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the aforementioned requirement must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the total & KDE; the idea of why does someone developed? thanks to & KDE; it is not only possible to expand, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web development to increase the utilization of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can expand productivity almost every task. by the program commotion, they & quantaplus; expand without any one script language skills to do. (more on this you can find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for a fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is available in any way with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in detailed documentation is with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; enter or run-helpcenter help: / quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">Quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file, which is not on it, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and all files as templates for the later use. check in the section about templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template's stock, only one error reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special signs for the clipboard there, contained special signs for the & HTML; -note, so that it is properly displayed and cannot be understood from the browser as formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; -dial, which is the correct way to add special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first line to insert & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection or from. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if you & PHP; -script error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Seek a string or regular expression in selected directory. a sort of grep or used combination with GUI and pre-defined expressions in order to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Shows the message window. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debuggers.</seg>
<seg id="2123">- and switch-up of the problem reporters at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; the problem of the problem is activated once you changes to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the symbol left from the main window. this column allows you to set Bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries predicted or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the mentioning after the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory according to new files that could be there. that enables you to copy video files into your project ordner or a subfolder, then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Downloads the files in your project on server. the list of available transport methods depend on your version of & KDE; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (Kio Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Attitudes, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Invites a project toolbar. these are stored in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu, if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialogue to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set up using settings. toolbars are stored in the toolbars of the toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the visual field. deletes it not from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar still not stored, you will be asked if you want to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2136">You can send their own tool bar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus; team, so that the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu entry opens up a new email message with tool bar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of tool bar to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; you or anyone has made someone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / unloading the entyping from the & DTD; it makes sense if the dutites from the & DTEP; to refresh, without the whole & DTEP; if this globally is not present and a typiration in the global KDE-file is not available, loading the loading.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags that are currently loaded into the currently loaded factory settings. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day evaluation dialog if there is one. this entry is always available in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submentions.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivated the intelligent insertion of tags. at present, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantaplus, inserts the insertion by tool bar if this day is contradicated by the rules on this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-in menu are listed below. click on. click on activated plugins disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Chooses the current file mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the makes; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Chooses the type of line identification. very useful if you know people to use the other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by the external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changes between different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries, changes sometimes need or create unclear graphics. recommended is the box mode, which is also the default setting, or the underwindow mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open underwindow. with a selection of a contract, the corresponding subroutine will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar on the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main frank and respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue will affect any application that use the KHTML part, including the & Konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Addresses the behavior of the Editorfensters. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialogue appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or which add sequences and sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in the context of the mouse pointing device, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but like with any open source project, developers always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; they will find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out at the top of the project, for example, after filling the project named the entire directory structure for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information can be changed later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine, which one wants to access, one unless edited local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, default settings of the chosen log might be used. depending on the setting of the remote machine, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to project and by default templates. if a common collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder to be saved in the toolbars for the project. it is a relative path to project and standard toolbars. if a common collection of files used for various projects should be set to this folder instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local file system into the project. several files or whole folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download static content you would like to download and change. in versarious scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Defaults, if files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be integrated. if a project is started upon new, not anhake.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can imagine a precise choice of good thinner.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main file. you can select the desired files through Anhaken or, by removing the haunted, out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen assistant of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be able to upload your work in the menu window in the menu window, or with the button Shift + Shift: F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholder possible), which are re-read in projects such as project ordner.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Complementary option to above, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which will be loaded with the opening of the project, can be read more about projections views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. at present, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set with the options options. in this case the bug hunting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the underwindow profiles, high load profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile, showing pointer a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the underwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the underwindow event configuration, one can unlock event actions and add these actions, change or delete this actions. event transactions will be executed if a certain event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see details in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not influence currently.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, open the project... from the menu project or the symbol project, open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project management features free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Stewards behave in the same way, however, the entries are missing and open... in conjunction with the right mouse button menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the site of uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only longer a profile is present, the button is blinded to prevent removing removing the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Password will retain and forget about programming. this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password to save files can't be found in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission, or leave the dialogue, if you change your opinion in front of the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-loading profiles can be uploaded and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to various servers. in editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & KDE; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety shaft, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the plate, so it can't be read easily, but each with programmers can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A projecting view is just a set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded into a project many views, i.e. by simple dipping of the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the current opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened in the menu project or the project toolbar, accessible via settings of the toolbar project toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which one has to do most. this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own work mode.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best about the menu toolbar. use and adding different. adding of toolbars below is treated below in the section of toolbars below.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The tool bar and symbols can be set out either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, you can remove any other actions such as toolbars, tool bar rename or toolbars, which can be specified in the dialogue, where to be stated, which actions can be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu on an action (symbol) on a toolbar, in addition, the entries will be removed and action, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Toolbars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with attitudes of toolbars... and setting actions set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are contained in essential documenting, code escalopes and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates such as a common file system with extendable organization and interfaces. you can copy, shift or connected any of the system existing directory in the storage space. templates are available in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you intended for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be inserted into any file unless text, so pictures, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are normally inserted in documents by links (such as pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are found in the pre-stock room under global templates. further information on the Template tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be compiled by any text document type. on the basis of this templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises work in appropriate ways to be efficient. some examples can be found in the pre-stock room under global templates. see for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document should be inserted into documents, but the same text area should be inserted into documents. you can find everything from a comment via a final table to be found on Javascript or Perl base. see some examples in the pre-stock room at global templates. see in for more information on the Templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are intended for all sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents arranged in a folder in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure according to platter (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As a template as a local template. save...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. watch in the pre-stock room under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on the template as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be dragged along with pulling and slip onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only into a board folder. you can use all file management functions, such as pulling and paste or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click in the file tree or in the project files building view on a folder right click and secure a name for the template. by default, it can be saved in the project ordner, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project prepositions allow a highly oriented approach. you can submit headlines and footer lines or link dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or link with them. additionally, you can keep some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the underwindow templates is based on the files created in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of this folder is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To determine the behavior of a folder, click on the folder with the right mouse button and select the properties menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded, as soon as Eltermost attributes is disguised.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapted for everything except ordinary folders. if a trunk file had been set in principle, it would be activated in this path, unless they would be explicit. in case of normal folder would appear, it would probably appear in a regular folder. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows you or posted text for templates in this folder. this could be general headline or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows to outfit a whole presentation to the appropriate head-line / footer lines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you have to add context menu (to show right mouse button) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and add templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source editor that can be accessed via the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second file divides the editing window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor is as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch on if necessary modifications to the source code editor, in which the source code is visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; file to a document, which includes PHP; source text indicates a small green symbol the Vohandensein of & PHP; -source code. to edit & PHP; it is necessary to edit the source code. there are no plans to change these behaviours.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and the cursor in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously, this mode is already active, removes the pressure signal to the active cursor from a window to others, whereby the position is retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... It can be set between synchronization after a click or automatically select the period of time. basically the recommendation is: a small span for fast calculator and a large span for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing properties is also possible with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this is why you can change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags permit the storage of information about the document itself e.g. buzzwords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click on the list allows change of content, such as key words on the column names and keyword key word2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add CSS rules on the list below or delete. a change about the list is possible, just like the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules are currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to bind an external CSS style template by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is like in a word processor, due to moving with arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor position is distinctive as usual. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing or button-button or reset button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is made in the same way above the tool bar, as in the source editor, it is obvious that the insertion of tags has already been inserted, e.g. an anchor day, surround with text, must be removed every other surrounding anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables assistant or the lists are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; they will need to work in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the investigation of style templates. in contrast to other programs for Stilprehension, the search for certain elements are possible and the execution of style may be persecuted.</seg>

<seg id="2274">On systems with installed Readline library, you can use the arrow keys to / from the run memory of the previously executed commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Several commands require more than one argument. quotes can be used to put together expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot;" as argument, a holding point is set in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" set.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the entries in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts with merge.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me knew only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed in these lines. and there was no evidence in the places where the change had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and modifications to white signs. later, lots of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to compare the text quickly, copy it into the clipboard and append it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently apart from one piece of code and changes. the original file (the base) helps to process the outcome. in this editor you can even edit the results directly. the screenshot shows three source files to merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you the same and merging complete folder. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; perform in the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and can be adjusted the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are visible. if lines only differ in certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary of the column at the left side. (no more trouble if no one changes the entry.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If one file is equal, and the other is different in one line, the colour indicates which file is different. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folder, then you can simplify the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder, folder 1 folder, folder 1 folder, folder 1 folder, folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows manual integration of file names, select the selection above the file browser (file...) or select a last edit file from the listing file. the open dialog can indicate the next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you have the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merge of folders will be selected for B and C, however, then uses & kdiff3; file name from A in both other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is crossed, the input field is active for target and is not necessarily required to specify an output file. you can also save this step further when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens up a dialog with attitudes. here you can specify options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text box. the comparison begins immediately. in open dialogue, you don't need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the knob button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use pulling and drag them: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes contains a file, e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar functions are, it would only be a relatively big effort. you would only need to download two corresponding files, to add them to & kdiff3; then you can copy the relevant sections easily, insert and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: there you can do nothing out of & kdiff3; only the flaw can be supported in a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors may interpret the pulling and copy of text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text box there is the info-line. the info-line includes the sign A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that windows are optional), leave the mouse to rest about the line. then a small relief window will show the whole name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are the letters A, B and C. A has the colour blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees the colour which file differs. if both files are different, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summarization column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, the colour is not so important to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g., white signs are only in character strings and comments, relevant for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the summary column of the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line is activated, the line is represented in broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (under the comparison list) also has an information line with the inscription:, the filename and [Gechanges] if you have processed the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons on the next dissolved / unused conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons are used, each difference is to be solved simultaneously, a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window, the group's first line is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (this will also appear a jump in the window in the window, where the group will appear in the background.) This group becomes highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes it remains through the automatic merge or through manual processing no further line more in the group; it is only a placeholder for the case that you will change your opinion and perhaps choose another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking which you might copy and paste something different.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the results window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when choosing the sources, select the options to ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate primarily with the image running and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you're in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys to the right, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and trl-end, sif as you can also use it from other programs here.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window you can also use the other buttons to edit mode. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and transfer mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarized columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already in the context of merge and editing window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons on the navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-down / Strg picture downhill) or the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upwards / Strg picture downhill) or the next / previous conflict. therefore, all non-soldered conflicts are still considered a conflict. therefore there must be a distinction between deleted and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking in the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Strg-insert). if enabled, will be automatically copied automatically into the clipboard and manually. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Zeilenenden are stored in accordance with the basic operating system. UNIX and Win32-based systems use chariot-return + cab cables\\\\. KDiff3 retains the source files for use, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of last used files will be automatically stored and re-established at the next start (menu adjusting - &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialogue also provides writings with variable width, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you turn this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen scripture does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Systems with only 16 or 256 colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered automatically. on these systems the button settings will automatically display an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, a tabulator sign will be inserted when pressing the tabulator button. otherwise, a tabulator sign will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you enter or press return, the setting of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to clipboard. manual copying into the clipboard then falls.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which tick-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the common choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When changing files tries & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during the first step can be ignored. the second step compares any line. in this step, white signs will not ignore. even when merging, white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a car trad '\' ends at the end of one line, but then you could only look up with different sizes in the page-on-side comparison, but then you might be different. when this option is activated, this option must be deactivated. in default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analyses, numbers and related signs ('0' - '9', '.', ') ignored. however, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively still looking for smaller differences. the option is activated in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The automatic resp mode determines this setting, as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the next invalid conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Dissolves automatic all conflicts in white signs by selecting the file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are used in many files, then take advantage of the automatic selection of conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are able to ignore it or Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in chapter on scanning by folders and deduction of a merging. look for details below documenting to the directory-comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, then the original version will be added, then the original version will be added with the Suffix .original, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Fits the language of user interface. this option does not apply to current running program. you need to end & kdiff3; finish and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is set to the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set to control over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if using this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Regarding the selection fields for encoding appears a short note, what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. as encoding for each file can be adjusted individually, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can define what encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you may not have to function with your codec. (for example, your files can handle 16-bit Unicode, but the processing command can only be set with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the coding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or oversight. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments, if the options are logged or Ignore C / C + + comments activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a colourfully coded transition column. but sometimes you might want to see the differences between two of three files. after choosing A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal even a second transition column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. keep out the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparisons next to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for viewing of long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. current file merge together. a simple click starts up the merge menu as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart interactions, then the name of the last used output file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor, which is exactly your requirements. for example, you can use this function for example, or to correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is passed to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is given the input commands. you can only write your own preprocessor, which is exactly your requirements. each input line must have a related issue-line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program itself. however, the good news is, however, that in most cases, sed or perl perfectly sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preceptive command to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ converts the folded text in capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to include files (info: / cvs / keyword\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimented with sed experimentation, you may be able to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar items.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The Ignorms of numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another preceptive command for cturntables. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Every characters between '[' and ']' is a matches, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several considerations at once. then you can use the Semikolon ';' to separate the proceeds from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed, you can also need something different such as perl -p-e 's / REGEXP / replacement / switch' However, for perl some details are different. where used\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessors are maintained for viewing and merging. the further operations change only the data, which sees the line-like Algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line processor will see the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but, as with any function, the text changes or differences, you may not notice certain differences in the worst case important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder reitalic.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... make a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... leads to selected actions either with all (F7 key), or just with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merge of individual files. you only need to specify folders on command line or in the file file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If there are three folders, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder was specified, it uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, do not merge the merge, select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the folder the folder informs you a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the folder, only the files are listed, which have been compared until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and any file that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can click on the + / - click or click on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory contains two functions of the subdirectories and fold all subdirectories with which you can upgrade all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file comparison will start and it appears a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window on the selected object. in such a case, the merge action can not be automatically chosen. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the above picture.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders will be considered identical if its entire content is identical. then, you also have the same color. among folders, the age is unremarkable for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colours reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow is and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. A folder and B one file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B does not have the same file type (e.g. A folder and B one file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folders were given, and if the option is synchronize, then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action is identical, that after a entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user can only be seen as visible file names for output file only B; directly after merging & kdiff3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders will be merged and select the option new file instead of merge (uncertain), then the error message appears. if the files are different, but the date is identical. files are identical, but the date is identical.. While the error is not fixed, the files can't be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is deducted after the other. it status column indicates that when the merge was successful, and according to other messages if something unexpected is completed, you should check out a last review and see if the status is fine.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the configuration dialog, the file comparative method is selected, KDiff3 will display further columns. these include the number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for solitary conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or related.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either run the just selected entry (file or oraries), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merging actions (even in all subfolders), you can launch the collision.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then the three-file merge mode C is used as target, in the two-file merge mode, A and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check whether all entries must be displayed in the target folder, even in folder structure, there are some options to be skipped by certain entries. check out these options to avoid unlovable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To bring together all entries: select directories together / continue in the directory "menu or press F7 (button abbreviation). to put together the current entry, choose the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If contradictory data types still exist uninvalid actions, a message appears on the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you assemble all entries, a dialogue window with the options lead, simulating and abrupt.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate when you want to see what would happen, without the really changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; leads then certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a merging window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're done with a file, choose folders / continue or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, an appropriate dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work goes on with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you fix the cause of the problem. if you have the opportunity to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually assembled, notice & kdiff3; these entries (in current session) and execute them together. even if the merge has been skipped or not stored, these entries are taken out as closed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that adjust to the specified patterns are displayed in the elemental tree. separate pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is not to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that will also be ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this may be specified with a .cvsignore file. (check under info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems files have a batch attribute. in other file systems marked a previous point. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the files will be compared to the links below. this is deactivated in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to file: if the option is switched off, the links will be addressed and recursive. (note that if the option is switched on and recursive, the links will result in a link which contains a link on itself.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Execute a complete analysis of each file by and shows the statistics columns. (the number of soles, unworn, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding Anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may seem to compare only the date of change and file size. please use caution. this option is activated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered as identical when copying the date of date. please use caution. this option is activated in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target file has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging files are identical. the results from merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences instead of merge the copy of the newer file as an action. (this will be considered unsafe, because the other file is not changed too. you should check this in any case.) This option is displayed in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or file is replaced by another or delete, then the original version will be renamed, then the extension .origines already exists, this will be erased without another backup. this also affects the normal merging of single files, not just the merge full folder. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the file-merge viewpoint is visible from the merge of single files; you can turn the window dividing with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can disable the windows directory in the window menu and switch between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file via double-click. however, you can also merge a single file directly together without the folder. once you save the result, the status is set to merge and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost, however, if you read the directory again: directory -menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of Kio Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders, which are on local or remote networks.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has another syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. contain. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system, sometimes by the protocol, sometimes a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link will display on a file or folder. then a file is accepted as a link-target. (FTP:, FTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit permissions or change-date. therefore, permissions or change of change from the original. (note this option is possible only with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently used as differences in KDevelop. KDevelop starts at first always the built-in differences viewer. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the viewer viewer and then select In KDiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; if it is used as a part, takes & kdiff3; the file names will exist in the Unified format. then, takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; patch patch is to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview - KDiff3Part. please note that if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small tool bar and menu. the merge or the comparison of folders will not be supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is Komfi) already exist. in addition, the name KDiff3 is already pointing out that it can merge the program diff3 out of the diff-tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs already very long and have learned a lot while I looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone to this path or are going to be so.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably not have the right PREFIX to KDE. preset installed in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). for more information regarding the README file you can find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters different, these lines are first treated as identical; but if only one non-white characters different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines for next to Each other, this is marginally this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor does not notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this important information is lost, however, if the result is simply stored as text file, and it's too much effort to design an additional file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too large. you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, it's suddenly lt; no src linens; appeared and the text doesn't delete. what does it mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to emphasize differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To be able to use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & KDE; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes will be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file of Changelog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & kdiff3; compile and install on a system with & KDE; use the following command in the basic file of & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives you the folder in your system where the KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have any problems when compile. should still be encountered difficulties, please report on the & KDE; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or schschalt-removing) copies in the clipboard and deletes the marked text. insert (Ctrl-V or switch-insert) add the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position resp. replace the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences are shown: files are identical in all folders, and therefore not in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder on these options)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. this also causes identical files to merge in the target folder. if the target file does not already contain these files, they are missing after merge. (behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is displayed in the default program.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for choosing the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present), they will be removed by clicking on the button again.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. underscores in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a minipreview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the workspaces, to end their size, to end it or move it. this works both within a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual workstations as well as the applications running. the applications can be selected and even can be moved to the desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in both Desktop and other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends where the right mouse button is clicked on the empty background of & Kpager; but if it was clicked on an application within & Kpager; but if there is also the symbol and the name of the application and the entries to minimize, maximize, on Desktop and Finish. commands are the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of desktop. appears only if it was clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends application to selected virtual Desktop. only appears when an application was clicked on.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this cross box is labeled, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">This field allows the & Kpager; show the numbers of virtual workspaces. it is displayed along with name, the names with ordinal numbers are provided, eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background is displayed as a background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs will appear as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty workspaces are displayed in order to enable its selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple, simple rectangles with the program window. symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and pixmap shows a small view of real program code. remark: Pixmap is only recommended for very rapid systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main lines will be determined: classic leaves & Kpager; in some other windows managers are known; horizontal, all virtual workspaces are present in a horizontal row and perpendicular in a vertical range, which is very good for the display side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with their content and postpone. also, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and you can set up selector switches... letting the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not apply as user root or apply to your system administrator. in this file you need to apply the key windowle fashion and apply to this one value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the package is debase, you need a working installation of the KDE Basic package.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click on the same place. it is thought to help people who suffer from repetitive strain instants (RSI) syndrome, and those any mouse click pains. furthermore, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle pain when using the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may need to feel pain associated with the use of your computer, you should look for a doctor if this is not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it even clearer: even if & kmousetool; pain avoid pain, which are caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that are caused by the cause of mouse, useless. and, as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be dropped for each different.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you interrupt the motion.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shift activated, makes & kmousetool; a break after the crutches of the mouse button. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little exercise, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This delay time has to be stored after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; take a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes is switched on, the rotary box is switched (1 / 10 s). here the time is set off, the mkmousetool; after lowering the mouse button, before the mouse button is discharged, if the mouse button doesn't get started.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on the right and return, followed by a break, click on the right and returns a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt file when the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can catch & KDE; to move the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to sound & multimedia, choose the sound system and click here to the tab. there is a slipegler sound buffer, which you turn on a lower value to reduce the antenna times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, will start & kmousetool; at any start of & KDE. this function is currently only under & KDE; available at GNOME or other window environments, to find out how you start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets the settings back to the values that were set when opening the dialog. you already have the button Apply, the settings are reset to the stand after the last push of application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent reference should be switched off first. if you have used to get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the antenna times of & KDE; at sounds too.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window, which do not display a link, does not lead to unintentionally allergic reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. it is usually quite easy. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come with the mouse ball into contact.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse is to mouse. however, it should be clear, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have the ball away, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole that the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can easily scratched with a flat blade or finger nails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the operating system of & kmousetool; if you're just going to shift the smart step, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer end through releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you run yourself a mouse click. this is reset the status of & kmousetool; back and you can continue as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool to perform mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want to have it. but if you don't want to run the mouse on a neutral field of desktop, if you don't want to run out the mouse on a neutral field of mind. secure zones for the mouse pointing out, the grey areas around the tool bar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent interlock, but I don't make it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes his time before you can handle it. it's very likely to move it into the clipboard, to move it into the clipboard. however, it will probably cause them to cause some problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart phone if you just start using & kmousetool; to use it instead: perform a mouse click at the end of the text box while moving the mouse pointing to the other end of the text, and again the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always be played when & kmousetool; the mouse button lets you use a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent shift also without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, you have to have the Xtest extension for & X window; it should be the case in most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The feature of the audible mouse clicks is available only if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; secretched the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointing short. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome, and to which the begot of the bristful pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins to get rid of the mouse process before the mouse button is started. in this way, also the pulling and lying with the mouse can be carried out.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text is processed before it is sent to program speech dispatcher. you are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false words or shortcuts, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of voice synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the methods of filtering, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen-Readern has the highest priority. it will continue all other orders and keeps these orders. if the edition of the Screen-Reader is read, the orders received will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor will be reserved. a warning has priority and keeps the output from news and normal text. these orders will continue after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next collective priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of using normal text. & kmouth; is an example of using a long text on a web site, you can meet & kmouth; somebody is welcome to enter the room. & KDE; notifications are also news. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every mission you used by the card card is a text job. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text applications. text requests are intended for issue longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are commissioned in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen-Readers. if a application sends the output of an Screen Readers, while & ktts; just one such reads, this issue is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen relievers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text applications as well as on & KDE; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters are editing the text, giving it to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Replacing parts of a text by other text. you can deliver either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is provided with pre-defined strings of chat messages such as: -) by text or for transferring news from & Conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>

<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters is adjustable, according to which it is applied to a language version. if the filter determines its rules does not apply, it will continue to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will be shown below the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">If you have a list of words or regular expressions, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern. these patterns are exchanged in the text, then the text will be exchanged against the corresponding replacement text. large and small inclination is not considered.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose any name that you only have to distinguish from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column, replacing it in accordance with the string out of the column. the list is shown in the displayed sequence from above downwards.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list, or delete a list from a file, the entries will be attached to the existing list.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for a speech output. this standard contains brands for control of voices, sound speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for the control of pronunciation for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You have to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) because this is the default voice, the festival is used in the SSML issue.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog don't go to 100L; SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and Satuboundless recognition filter (SDB filter). therefore, the first proposition must be synthesized, as only the first proposition must be synthesized, not to jump or pause or cancel, even if the language synthesizers cannot directly support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the propositional recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts; the input is automatically set up automatically. you can change its settings or add another propositional recognition filter, but the recipients are rounded off.</seg>
<seg id="2729">At the easiest, you will learn the setup of the speaker selection. check out the box selection, select a number of properties and check out how the selection of the microphone has changed. of course, you have to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then, faster with reading, because only the first set must be processed and not the whole text box, which can last long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">They then write records on the box card or break off, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal Satzboundless recognition filter is automatically set up when you start a kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just be removed. change nothing at that filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional recognition filter compare text with a regular expression of punishing and append a tabulators (Decimal code 8) to the propositional limits (Decimal code 8) in front of the filters automatically removed from the text). note that the standard sentence changes will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied to & KDE; messages (knot), warnings, messages or the output of screen rabugs.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal Satzboundless recognition filter, you can insert this again by charging the in & ktts; included file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>

<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the board card speaker). in other words, no interchangeable qualities are stipulated.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the proper speaker, which has all the properties of a furnished speaking person. if you select the user's settings, select & ktts; follow this speaker; otherwise select & ktts; the narrator, who originally set the original properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the select button.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker. if this feature doesn't play a role, you do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this checkbox when the property should have priority before other features. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when understanding the output, it will always be used as a primary feature. if you want this feature rarely, you may need to specify the attribute language, if you know that a specific application text in another language is sent out in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the area, which is most likely to clear the following, click on the drop button and then use the speaker, which is the closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr stops immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support but I do not get back traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts, was finished. probably, you have to register the GST register-0.8. if the problem is not solved. if the problem is not solved, possibly a non-compatible version of GStreamer may be installed. you can try to upgrade or uninstall gamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output of ALSA is not working when I play music simultaneously with another application. if I get a text reservation, freezes & ktts; a message that says: drop to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts involving ALSA will prevent the simultaneous open of multiple PCM devices. hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) under www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an extra voice for festival online. I installed it and can use it in the festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the map of audio there is a setting speed. so this works, the program SOX has to be installed and has to be installed via the environment variable PATH. some synthesiology shows how festival Interactive offers an attitude to speed. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed will be ignored when & ktts; & HTML; (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filters for the conversion of & HTML; according to & XML; (see) or, if you are completely brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to-SSML file filter, and put the microphone speed up.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that enables the administration of networking interface, routine and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to enable the user to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. module settings (knetworkconf;) can be launched by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & kmenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't install. physical devices and their drivers have to be functional and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device is at all possible and enables the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed on installation of & Linux; installed and set up. network devices will be added later, the driver must be loaded with adaptation to the following files:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module settings will be loaded when the network settings are selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is chosen to automatically detect the platform used on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be recognized, the recommended selection is offered, the distribution and the Releasestand will be best. by checking the setting non-reask, the definition can be met permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will automatically be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings are possible only in system administration mode. before, all options will be shown, which means the settings can only be considered, the change mode is not possible. in the system administration mode, you will enter the button mode at the right end of the module mode. it is necessary to enter the password mode.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the module's total functionality is available. this is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The adjusted network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button... set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Settings menu displays the dialog with further opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP server will be fetched by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in the automatic mode the TCP / IP information is required for each system start, so no additional setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP should be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, without DHCP or BOOTP can set the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field netmask, the netmask is fixed.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initialize the network interface of the booting. if the initialization is not allowed, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialog are displayed as the characteristics of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address would not be used on the network. if an IP address would already be used. with ping in the & Console, you can determine whether the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or disabled according to requirements. switching on an inserted network device is performed by selecting from the list and click on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or disabled according to requirements. activating a activated network device takes place from selecting the list and click on the interface....</seg>

<seg id="2819">If computers are more than a network interface, the interface must be selected to the network where the Gateway Computer is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name for the respective IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the calculator calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS is triggering this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator on the name solution part of the Reitersolution solution allows a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS entries can be arranged through a selection of a contract and connection or herlassification in the list with the dumplings, or to be arranged in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking button... from the machine calculator to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will add New Nameservers dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of DNS server and then click the button Add. entry will then be added in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From a group of calculator to name resolution, select one entry and then click on the button Edit.... It will edit the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The well-known calculator describes host name-to-IP address for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily in the boat when no DNS servers are available. in small, connected networks can replace the DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list includes well-known calculator some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. these are still in the test release of IP must replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known host and click Add.... The New alias entry is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the button. if the well-known calculator has several alias names, de button Add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of an eminently known host from the list and select Edit.... The dialog named Calculator is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then by clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings in the module settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage by & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & KDE; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply downloading the rpm package and install in one & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & KDE will not be sufficient, but also the development planning with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to be experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should afford this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic networks are given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf files are discussed. changeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. this appendix will only support basic information about the integration of the PCs into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks operate with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large spreading. IPv6 is expected to pass through the future. this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address is assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the response administrator if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be selected any arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up one's own small (home) network use the IP address to be selected for this purpose, to avoid IP address accounts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so their use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a Gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses are used in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all the computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is required for the IP continuation.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your local machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files are located, which are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed in DSL connections, so it is no surprise when in case of active DSL connections, another content is defined to be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by using the scripts in sub-config. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be stored by & dat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; spitting the band back and reads the pretension information of the band. recognize & kdat; the preferences on the band are not, you will be asked whether the tape is supposed to formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the prejudice, looking for the appropriate index on your record. cannot be found whether the band index is to be created.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Everything went smoothly, the symbol is changing for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated. in the Status Bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the band can now be searched for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; gives a change of symbol for the band that the binding is solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & dat; it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape drives must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not comply with the formatting at & kdat; this process does not need to be formatted before using the band of & kdat; formatted a formatting of the band ahead, DAT drives do not work.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity will drive & kdat; with the band's formatting. all data on the band are lost! after completion of the formatting process the tape is automatically inserted and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the encrypted files. this can happen to three types:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select one file or folder in local file tree. it will only be saved to this file or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, dialogue: dialogue shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Mark a file or folder in one of the file entry for the drive. it's only checked the selected file or folders.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the files for the tape with a hooks. only the selected files and / or subfolder are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been launched, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialogue, you can check your selection and change the folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, dialogue will appear. this dialogue shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can use the recovery, the files you need to recover will be selected. this can be made up to two types:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select one file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Mark the desired files from one of the archives with a chicks. only the selected files and / or subfolder are restored.</seg>

<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialogue appears. this dialogue shows the progress of the transformation process, and the data throughput, and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it shows itself as necessary to recreate the bandindexfile using the tape content. this process clears all existing index files for this band. you can create the index to two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This is a fuse profile with the just selected files and default settings. you can use the following settings for ensuring the safety profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder, in which the backup should take place. the list of notified files is automatically updated according to the selected file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under backup files, only the files are stored on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are mounted on other file systems, you can name separately under backup files. each entry is considered from tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files are secured, which have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used for determining the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before the tar call. this causes all files to be secured and create a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files were not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set up on the menu item KDat... in menu settings. the following settings can be required:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-relocation version of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmit & kdat; before the band is integrated, the command is discharged to the drive. for some drives this is necessary, before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & knodat; to unlock the throw from the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the loosening of the integration of & kdat; automatically cast the tape. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; the hardware size is to change for tape drive. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you need to tell & dat; in any case, block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the band. this file should only prove one memory block on the band. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the name: seconds, where the name is the complete name of the system, which the band formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era has been formatted into the band.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that can be administrated directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it does not act for incremental fuses.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup copy. this symbol is only active when a band is inbound.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & KDE; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unexperienced users, where you can get information about your system, or where the system log the different protocol files. moreover, the system enables quick access to information about problems based on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. it is a simplified representation of the protocol-files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who can not know where you can obtain information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows you to provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, some advanced functions are preparing to extract and evaluate the protocol-files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 offers & ksystemlog; a series of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot you see & ksystemlog; functions available, with their help to filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol-file easily and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Following the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol, will not be displayed. if you're not running a small message window, you'll usually find it on Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected criterion or to filter strings. in default settings the list of log files will be automatically deleted. in default, a protocol line will be displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line is displayed only if included in one of the columns of the filter search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry on this site. the string of the filter search riffs will then be matched only with entries in the protocol-file system protocol, and apply in the filter bar on the name of a process, so you can download & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you identify the important protocol lines. protocol-lines of level errors are displayed with a visible color as protocol lines of level hint. the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display certain process only (for example in the system protocol or in cron protocol), you can be useful for example if you want to investigate the output of a particular command such as the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can add the option to new lines in the context menu of the main fliners to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate substations. to open this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you have selected a window, select a protocol on display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum software software.org Dort you will find further information about the source sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following files des & KDE; Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; im & KDE; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather well known (and in the following also named as) & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init System develops rapidly to the standard for controlling the program launches in the & Linux; hence, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and re-formatting. therefore you need to be sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort will find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service, which you want to start taking on another runlevel. system services include such matters such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such stuff like setserial, which is only launched once. such calls are to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on its part under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use of it. you can also make a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different places after the program init and starts the first he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is available in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably discover that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand, then you can repair it manually by using the system re-run and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it begin with all the right scripts? if you do -l enter in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that there is an argument such as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one includes a K, the script will be called with the argument. if it includes an S, the script will be called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could take & eg; a server running level, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user-Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is easy to say not to say trivial: simply pull one entry from the area of available system services to one of the six Runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevels or modify the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if they draw out a entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are postponed if you have to copy these in a new runway. to select it only on a new runlevel, you must select explicitly copy from the menu menu and insert into the target range -- even then, if the same record already exists in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sortiary number of a details can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the surrounding numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there are currently no way to restore entries which were thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab button to activate the various working ranges (Available System Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sortiary number or the name of a details manually, press the input button to open the properties dialog. please use the dialog by re-pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data lossement, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are collected in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are restored by & ksysv; again, changes to the presets are stored in local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with standard Runlevels, and now the machine starts permanently new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-use mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should be all right).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type of which system services are started in these distributions, however, is simplified the configuration for proprietary deposits in this distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to standard. authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please verify that all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also, whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply quit without message if your configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me more information about the Runlevel so that this manual may be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to store them. either use the corresponding icon of tool bar or entry store in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two box cards, user and user guide. to edit the desired users or the desired group with double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog User and Group Features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some box cards are only represented when you have activated extended system settings. only if you have activated multiple restrictions (Quota) for users, you will be able to display individual settings. additional boxes cards appear, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD uniforms.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password card password is published if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD uniforms are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card is only activated, if for at least one-connected file system space limitation (Quota) is activated and initialized (detectable in the file quotas / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for each user, whereby the limited restrictions are in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system will be selected using the field's help field.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The board map groups informs information about the group assignments of the selected user. the default group, to which the user you will find in the Primeric Group. furthermore, the user can mark in other groups by marking it in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog characteristics of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, add the user or group menu, or click the matching Add button of the toolbar. edit or delete the selected users or the selected group works similar.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO-BootManager, remove and change the boot password, remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
