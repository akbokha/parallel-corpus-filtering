although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , American authors have read and run his sports .
in fact , this country had become a very profound impact on me that I was a journalist , mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil @-@ mag@@ istr@@ ate , who wanted to occupy his interest , which he wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that &apos;s the absolute truth , all others , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , had my admi@@ ration for the USA only reinforced .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of con@@ sp@@ inn@@ ed people .
I even wrote a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of its ascent is for me as he moves with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful .
he says what he thinks he was his former colleague , and explains publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro American and Women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his testimony and voted in flocks for him .
the 13 million votes he won with the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support these big@@ otte person , I asked me ?
I could not put Tr@@ ump and his voters to be in line with people I met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my Professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , receives people from around the world , a deeply believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
in addition , Tr@@ um@@ ps has not voted to persu@@ ade the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er &quot; by Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present publisher of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at stake .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity which I had strug@@ gled with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for her life long and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
it still fits with the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to acc@@ ust@@ om us to the complexity of American life .
then , there were Andrew vit@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice has helped me much in my career .
these people , they em@@ bodied by they em@@ bodied my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump b@@ ump his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a halt , and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of its contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either distributed to rac@@ ism and fan@@ atism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , almost broke the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ assi@@ sts .
the people accept , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and resp@@ ect@@ ful and implies an in@@ ability to understand those who are acting to another way and think .
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into consideration .
could it be that those voters have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they don &apos;t want control over a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they wanted to say that they are still important in America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to find a man who looks down with contemp@@ t upon those who looks different .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) : as much as &quot; The rebellion of the White against all other eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties &quot; ; word play made of white in touch to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash ( which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones , has exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have , America is always welcome .
because this country chose to be the president , twice the son of a Ken@@ i@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise to say : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in the Americas after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the ruin , they say .
with all of this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier , who is fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; said Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a loud sound &quot; No ! &quot;
would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and silent &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is this not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for whom his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children leave their love for music not by garbage .
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instruments &quot; by Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Flick@@ r user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
the music that is played at both places is not only the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill colony , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years , the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults existing music orchest@@ ras , which has found a possibility of over@@ coming the surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs violence .
but this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hop@@ el@@ iness .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always get laughing and with shining eyes and play in the action you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play .
music from garbage
more than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located in the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital &apos;s capital - on instruments which are made of re@@ processed waste material :
music with recovered instruments , made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez has begun to turn parts of the waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate violin , viola , c@@ elli , contra@@ bass guitars , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher , remembers the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura :
first it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin brought out of tr@@ ash .
today , there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and call The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who are with him and of him are the troubles - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspi@@ rational song from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra performed his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can be successfully fighting illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought .
this entry , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication is in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the common use of contents .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before starting the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were brought accordingly to them and is little incl@@ ined to welcome a lawyer of this kind to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ cs , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to give him a har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permits .
&quot; suddenly the Premier was en@@ cir@@ cled by countries that you have just refused , &quot; says Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ y authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship of his time and persecuted .
in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia , because of pill@@ aging fish stocks .
the core of this initiative which protects the criminal practices and protect resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries in 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally stop fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network have the six countries that the Premier were exp@@ elled from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are con@@ sp@@ inn@@ ed and work together . you exchange information and get each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured , is hidden because it is extremely difficult to use . thus , illegal fishing is a main cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the inten@@ tional contemp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may harm a delicate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing were im@@ pregn@@ ated by bureaucra@@ tic hur@@ d@@ les , and through the worm stamp , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen now in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there you can exchange individual countries , such as lists existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea , via satellite data .
this enables the authorities to mark the ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as those who suggest that a ship li@@ stens to his caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such studies can indicate whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly , whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing , can be ref@@ unded on the basis of such information that the ships can &apos;t sell their cargo . and that they may not be forced to pay their charge , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Senior Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already known platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost turnover , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penet@@ rate the waters in East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying imag@@ inary names , fishing @-@ protected species and fish in wildlife areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ defined control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; you must@@ n &apos;t run my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal slip hole try to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 years of susp@@ icious ships .
it has exposed criminal networks , which had been distributed licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been followed and found refuge .
because of its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to attract susp@@ icious ships precise .
courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that is constantly evol@@ ving , helps prevent illegal ships who like to hide yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , chief analyst at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO , which also deals with fish@@ eries @-@ data and support F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be subscri@@ bed by satellite .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system which combines different levels of information . it is supposed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with larger precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each individual tra@@ il@@ able ship can be displayed worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours , to get a better picture of it , who &apos;s what you do - that &apos;s just meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join her resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel det@@ ective , but they also d@@ eter them away .
ships that were used previously without license fis@@ her and hardly had any consequences with consequences , you know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i countries participated in a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tra@@ w@@ l nets , whose use is forbidden .
courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that we now have to copy other countries , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; we are a study subject . &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will van@@ ish by illegal fishing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 there are six countries closed to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security is the aim to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country was reported on its first big triumph in October : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship used under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and have been banned w@@ ow nets which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also enclosed in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative approach to the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world . Emma Bry@@ ce is freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the topic environment , technology and nutrition .

the road movements in Venezuela seems to only be the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they will be regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the centrally @-@ north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , what is noticeable in everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute deficiency of food and drugs .
many representatives of the opposition saw the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance for a fundamental change , but ultimately , the keeping of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne Dí@@ az , Con@@ tribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in its latest article in the context of the government statement as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate is estimated to be the highest throughout the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and for many as the only way to return to the country , to conquer its institutional structures and close a new governance .

particularly big waves beat the message about police repression in the centrally @-@ located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local government to protect themselves from the government &apos;s own testimony before police and armed supporters .
hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ ial State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs include :

others under@@ take this protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the disast@@ rous economic crisis , making it rather critical to leave critical voices :
they have taken us so much - but also fear !

the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced from his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba .
now , as an adult man , Qui@@ x@@ ano now said in the part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in Cordoba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were examined during the Argentine military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano hasn &apos;t visited his life .
starting with the burden , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed in the age of 15 years he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained his family sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
in the situation then , I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I was not able to know that my father was a thief , fol@@ ky and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ eri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was a deputy of the secret service department 141 in the La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had seen the extent of atro@@ cities , which he had seen as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows , which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made combat sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that she will not leave you one day , and I then have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolution@@ aries of Argentina .
therefore he charged me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me , I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had taken me up .
on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : archives , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , propaganda stamps , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ It is over , the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la , everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wrapped in a blanket , and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw it was a great cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day , I went to the other hand of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were removed , and refra@@ ined me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed out an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I saw in , and saw a song that were tortured on men .
she looked like a field bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened at the body of the person who had just tied up there .
they cap@@ tiv@@ ated a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ threw him with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the cont@@ ention there was there was horri@@ bly ... like a dirty wine .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : what is it possible for a man to do so much suffering from another ?
&quot; I knew that these people were killed . &quot;
when my father took me for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eyes .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were attached to the face down - everyone was tied to hands and feet .
in the proximity of the en@@ chan@@ ted people still on the matt@@ resses .
when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you look at that , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and killed by soldiers .
I know this , because my father spoke at home .
beside La Cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms known as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
( according to data from survivors of the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of being indicted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emilio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the road that you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ classi@@ fying a number .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all possible sorts of stolen things .
at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military myself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war ra@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military rab@@ bit , which one gets lost to an enemy which is fought .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... miss , then no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the head of security forces to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t get it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you who sti@@ pul@@ ate the cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded anger , and struck me , and cried , saying ,
if you go so far , then I will find you and embra@@ cing you .
we don &apos;t need any others !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process I showed a photo of that , on which I wore a jacket and a wheel pul@@ lover of wool . I had my father out from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being con@@ sp@@ ying with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay a burden to me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to tell .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ h@@ ein@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if one has only children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops further and recognis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were ex@@ iled during the dictatorship , but why should the bodies disappear ?
why do children de@@ duce ?
one day , my father brought a girl with her home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always stood the question again : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could not have been put in prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their bodies disappear ?
were these people not also families , whom one could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ h@@ ous act , which one can do a man .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
they were tro@@ dden down and there is no idea , no idea , where . &quot; you never find something , &quot; said my father .
but something remains naturally always .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea , to display my father , arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made his accus@@ ation because of all the atro@@ cities I had to live for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly , and asked me , why the whole @-@ time Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they allegedly defended themselves .
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have committed horri@@ fic crimes and you have comp@@ elled me as a child to participate .
he only said &quot; Well then to me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I accepted the first display .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can submit to me that I am not cleans@@ ed . I have finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ x@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , standing before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : among them heavy duty of de@@ priv@@ ation in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a fall of ab@@ duction of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the size of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court sentenced in 28 cases of life sentences and in nine cases of sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 accused were killed during the trial .

all the def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military member , former police and civil staff members .
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human minds .
the tribunal is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have been working for years of justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ in@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represented the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted for 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ in@@ ean government handed over to La Per@@ la where there was a memorial to be erected there , which now is managed by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible driving &quot;
the sign with the translation errors of a center in Kyoto , where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
machining the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month Wit@@ nesses of a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a sign the Japanese word was per@@ cep@@ ted by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ko@@ un@@ ten@@ sh@@ a ) , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but may be also translated with malign@@ ant mind &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was published in the entrance area and the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
machining the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local lo@@ ids to him .
the Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n in Kyoto was written :
&quot; how could it come to an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city just as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holmes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the correct translation of English translation was initially removed . the name of &quot; Justice &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gramm@@ atically failed to be the correct name of &quot; El@@ der . &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ fecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture . furthermore , it explained that the mistake had already been included in the text that they had received from trans@@ lators , and that the translation was not checked on their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the ap@@ ologies :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt through inadequate correction ( the translation ) on our side , &quot; said the police .
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an un@@ reasonable description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are , however , certainly to worry .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents by senior citizens . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Seniors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 deaths .
the share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decreased overall , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused accidents during the same period .
the rep@@ utable critic in the article published in the article published by the article comments on the light that show the pre@@ judi@@ ces of some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo above translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; So f@@ law@@ ed is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gra@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia as well
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure @-@ pit for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of trans@@ lators are diverse .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires an active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in the case of native language . generally , the belief that trans@@ lators in the target language - not in the initial language - mother language should be .
for example , a French native speaker should translate by the English to French - not from the French into English .
photo by Flick@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese firms are unable to deal with English as a mother tongue , who could translate translations into English . this may seem to be lacking understanding of the excess , cost @-@ quality , or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who have no foreign employees , let translations exist yet fir@@ mer . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge as the best are estimated to become a translator , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .

machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results .
the ver@@ itable and en@@ ig@@ matic sets that are created by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English formulation in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , often used T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not even read or understood .
photo by Flick@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors like jewelry is still acceptable , or at least harmless . but of major companies or by the government that means the funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the Kyoto city uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protest and interest measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , April 7 , noti@@ fied Venezu@@ elan Internet users that they have no access to the online transmitter Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that Internet access appearances are not accessible by V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV .
also other online broad@@ casts took recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positions groups that resist the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive , and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos Dí@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is glu@@ ed , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Z@@ ensu@@ r : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ elan provider is locked once again .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
since 2014 , traditional media reports on protests regarding protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission appe@@ aled to them with fin@@ es and closing arguments when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered me at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IN &apos;s local NGO also confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also affects the website , where the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
the research group of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local Internet service providers could use DNA . thereby , it is a technology that answer the DNS server requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNA , the server respon@@ ds wrong or denied the request when calling for such a website .
we confirm the DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third B@@ anned channel , was hired on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who crossed the protests in Caracas live live .
Flo@@ res was sm@@ itten , while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government was informed that the government is regulated via Internet connections : the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans will always be able to provide access to multi@@ medi@@ al reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to slaves , in order to get an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ st@@ ta a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and collec@@ ts testimony of other cri@@ st@@ tas who were just like they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by the tur@@ ally who published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , processed by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not working together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride in her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas to work in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is very simple : a big family with little money over her min@@ der@@ year old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to afford a countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be raised in the context of a contract .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints of human rights organisations .
after completing his studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimony , and den@@ ounced and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things in the name , as the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ st@@ tas , guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is one of the family who have their daughter in faith that they will improve their training , improve their position in society and arise &quot; something from themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise get an apprentic@@ eship , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience many years later .
sometimes they never experienced it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the un@@ seen in par@@ agu@@ ing households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , their bodies showed traces of heavy strokes . shortly after that , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military @-@ members Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as official at the residents .
Mar@@ ín lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira was killed , as long as with a stick to Mar@@ ín , until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later , the media reported about the incident .
they insi@@ sted that the murdered child was a cri@@ st@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply ro@@ oted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl &apos;s death .
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came to protest appearances and demanded that there would be no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photographs were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to harm the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbour &apos;s neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations required a generous examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case come from court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be landmark - if for the first time in history , the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is a case .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k where her father worked , bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the work and started to sell money on the street or on the market , to make money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina has been sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still had time to learn .
it stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , clean the fridge , cleaning the living room , polished the furniture and infected the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more leisure time she had .
but that time was limited , because they had to do dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembers .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the househ@@ ol@@ ders , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who had been in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some departure of the Hous@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and Editorial were drawn from opposition leaders such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; .
in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media over the regime &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he kept them for intelligent , but not with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hous@@ eh@@ r had found someone who heard about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I heard there again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who would speak to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they had the education that they had allowed to lose again , declares them .
it was , however , completely clear that they had paid for everything they paid for them with their hard work .
even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing that almost never talked about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas to go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a cri@@ st@@ ta .
I was able to invite anyone home at home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships are created , I felt very clearly that I was one group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can view jobs for cleaning staff and kinder@@ g@@ ages in Paraguay .
the administr@@ ators of the group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the district As@@ unci@@ on .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
learning to learn .
please tell you .
beginning from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the site Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have had an el@@ eventh girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very hand@@ some , &quot; she wrote .
the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland that wants to work . &quot;
then the editor of the ad was once again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look at if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in Pro@@ log for the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ Hair@@ do cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long still ? ) , a collection of testimon@@ i@@ als of a former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ tiz :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice in the early history ) and the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , which had to surrender to their &quot; wives &quot; ( where the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ral land had to be considered to be a Hal@@ b slaves ) , and therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys become involved in a system of slavery where they are easy victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are known as the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft bill writes Egyptian users social media to register in the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians , ordered a bill of bill , voted &quot; Reg@@ ulations regarding the use of the use and user social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on the law , then a place would be established , which is assigned to share social media , citizens and citizens .
within six months with acceptance of the law , user names would have to be registered on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , it may take a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; every we@@ de application , which is running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when there is no indication of the design , as Egyptian authorities are supposed to be on the user &apos;s user experience , that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is unable to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received a user name and a password to come by the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those who would be necessary for Egyptians for Egyptians , to obtain information on their identity , to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans stand .
experts and experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ics ( in German &quot; Senior Research Strategy &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; ) told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that same as they could control physical public and private spaces - it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , then it means that they are working a strong monitoring system to request a citizen or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .

high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north east of Iraq , the Tier@@ ra H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the s@@ cour@@ ier Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of leop@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ard ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat as they always find less lo@@ ot .
why is this certain type of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza in the video , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the growth of ecos@@ ystem depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually in the wild , is low and goes towards zero . as the team is fixed in the video that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy .
as a trained biolog@@ ist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately liked a different side of their country , which is not just from war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals since six years and involved in educational programs of Nature Iraq .
since 2013 , it is also a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is preparing that dust zones are set up for wildlife in the Kurdistan region .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made for the nor@@ theastern Japan , were forced to rebuild the lives of those who had been affected by the &quot; thre@@ ef@@ old disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a tsunami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a et@@ c@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience the earthquake and resulted from the tsunami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the tsunami had to disappear whole coastal cities from the map .
in addition to that , Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had an accident with an accident , already in that alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows a local perspective which advances to six years later to rebuild the life of the local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as a survey results of the affected themselves .
the residential construction industry in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( per@@ cep@@ ts , mar@@ g@@ at@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i &apos;s biggest success in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures were completed , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such buildings , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with 70 percent , is the final light .
furthermore , six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald ( eg@@ ro@@ wers , dri@@ ac@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still trying to res@@ ettle in final spare parts .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in home shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , more than 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima , and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such an Beh@@ a@@ sions .
almost 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in the year 2011 . more than 75 percent of ev@@ ac@@ uation , which were hau@@ led after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ lls , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is 34 percent .
the stand of work and daily life in the three affected Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 out of 1100 schools , who were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their gates by December 2016 , which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures can be far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation again , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fishing ports have re @-@ included .
the tsunami and nuclear accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land large areas .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and could be used by less than 50 percent of the land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of the atomic fact , because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are in the &quot; nuclear zone &quot; zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered far again , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent higher at the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can feature only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe is almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall image , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation by . they questioned about the status of reconstruction and also , as their empire has changed towards the tsunami .
in its introduction of this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper declares :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted an interro@@ g@@ ation to bring more about the tsunami @-@ consciousness under the native population experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local population have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disasters disease has been done .
what about those who were ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also a witness of the worst , disast@@ rous , atomic accident , the Japan ever had to experience .
almost 63 thousand people from Fu@@ kus@@ hima have been re@@ located almost 63 thousand people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , have been converted into permanent houses .
after the 2017 state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside of their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ sk , are older than 50 years old . you should compete in right Beh@@ ind the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with massive construction projects . this is about building projects that are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo that will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries , which speak another language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that a more links than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces to expand our perspectives and recall that the world ultimately is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention when they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Veron@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music worked on the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia was beaten with a ra@@ vine against the head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors took him this Saturday and now gave him into an artificial coma .
his condition is critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , the face of the police officers have also identified , which was attacked with a b@@ lows . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police arrested in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident at the incident .
the pictures show the police officers as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia and his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
would a police officer accused by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be seen for six months in television and the entire oppression would thus justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a Press channel of Media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video of Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edic benefits shortly thereafter .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is filmed , also appeared in social networks .
in the shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ an Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activist in Go@@ i@@ ás &apos;s memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was attacked the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who had been attacked on the intensive care of a polic@@ eman , after being attacked by a polic@@ eman , who struck him face in his face .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where it came to protest against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
polic@@ emen were sitting at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
S &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace People ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via speakers to aband@@ on violence against prot@@ esters .
this is also a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again the Brazilian media is del@@ u@@ ded by the Brazilian media by pushing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a frag@@ ile glass window to illustrate with a photo of their title pages illu@@ stra@@ tive .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window window than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must be recogni@@ zable , if one is strictly against any form of damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a wei@@ rd , indi@@ gesti@@ ble meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are led by headlines by the &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
the for@@ ds of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso close hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Pop@@ ular church in Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as a Central - based on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no notable sugar harvest on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane .
after passing the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost and after its installations , only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others signed and comm@@ utes to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ env@@ y who rises every day at 4 : 00 AM , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar@@ cane factories in the east of the region of sugar , which are after a long in@@ active period , because they were preserved .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene remembers exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would have received the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar@@ cane industry resi@@ sts the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , of I@@ ne@@ ff@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message would have been a motive for some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more curiosity .
why was the Cuban sugar pipe industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar@@ cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete , and hardly competitive for the country .
initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories , which can produce sugar for the most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar@@ cane plant@@ ations and the rising crisis on the global market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ ans per pound , according to the 2016 report published by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations .
when the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s Day will go to history with certainty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These were the first words of the Cuban President Fi@@ del Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the process of re@@ structure began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the stagn@@ ation of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory for 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respondents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to get the place , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first leap year , the first letters began to come .
it was official documents related to the documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ales Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any arrest .
from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters were increasingly frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ set factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the be@@ et factories , &quot; he as@@ sures us .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in holding his will at the holding of the factory , where construction he helped , was involved .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important job producers was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work@@ places and services , which have generated plants in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut @-@ speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that there were no longer in operation for the areas whose factories had been running well for five years .
the price of the population for closure of sugar@@ cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the Volks@@ congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar@@ cane factory ended , or better , when they began to shut it off , they also listened to the road to paved the road , also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to catch other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty raised the old soldiers a pension from two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no subsequent person , nevertheless he gives the lies that one told him not .
they have tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene walks in r@@ ents for 65 years , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations young@@ sters use hip @-@ hop to express itself and maintain their own culture
recording a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations Communities in all of Canada employ themselves with topics that are important to them . they do with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of touring workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an Tour , mobile audio studios have been bringing directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec and ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities and then working with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ stars together .
the workshop is increasing with the young participants in our conversations , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confron@@ tation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever it comes into the sense .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the leading actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o , in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were generally not explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video game to conv@@ ey how important the traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of influences .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters don &apos;t always master the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people participating here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who lie@@ ve them a stron@@ gh@@ s in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as a translation into English , translated into German :
sometimes I feel , nobody would ever be interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to go on Earth for my days
that is the day you will take to our cry .
because we have lost our way in life as youth .
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so you can grow and go forward in our youth as well
thus , they can do that , for what they intended for cre@@ ators
in the commentary part , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au adds a contribution and adds the St@@ rop@@ he published in Sil@@ en@@ schrift ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can watch plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are located close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( per@@ cep@@ ts to the inter@@ iors of the dishes &quot; ) from every food that is served in this restaurant .
customers are viewing this plastic dishes , then decide whether they entered the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi District , there are a variety of these small companies that manufacture the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning it today in show@@ y cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new with plastic @-@ coated cell stra@@ ps , as they are shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally different foods have been turned to kit@@ ten collecting objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ ti@@ fications is increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case a Imperial @-@ don ( a popular bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone stand .
for these tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as mobile phone stand .
we have also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple , which is holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can betra@@ y my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appeti@@ zing form , to surprise your colleagues or family members un@@ pleas@@ antly .
our latest mobile stand has the form of mel@@ on ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and a mol@@ yb@@ den@@ um of dried salmon .
more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be found under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 drop of the business .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then gives you this video an insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . like for example with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug dealers &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chiev@@ ous and killed regularly appear in statistics . however , this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that struggle with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of Sin@@ alo@@ a , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict entirely in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the sad@@ ness or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each body , behind every bone is buried in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds may never cure .
this is why the Mexican news portal animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug retailers live &quot; ) , which is said to give this victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between prosec@@ uting authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives .
the implic@@ ations are much deeper .
for example , if business are close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole churches need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear of life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who takes secret graves any weekend after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , which only lost their father , four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her neph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have asked to go , go to the tom@@ bs , after the people we loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in a shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment , they have no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay off , because that demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only have the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and the State .
the project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been able to know illness and sensation of journ@@ alism since a few years .
I come over every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures that actually can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the panel .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only ones that disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body once .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks he will become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it &apos;s great . and it &apos;s also not normal that people will hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
for me it is , as if they mo@@ cks those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of mankind is incredible for me if death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in one neighboring village was justified to be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to agree that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stirring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months Er@@ press@@ ung in the Main stad@@ t@@ District : like a family with threats of threats , &quot; it describes how armed criminals took money from their business until the end did not only destroy the business , but also had torn its family apart .
you think of everything you lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes again high , when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will run or kill you .
I asked myself in these fear@@ less days whether weeping would dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to weep . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction , he asks questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it to rise in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Bryan is a father@@ less and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to make a egg coo@@ ks , potatoes , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for preparing fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine nar@@ rows on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole lives of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years ago when he just found a few blocks away from his father , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who had been shot by armed men out of a moving car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was killed by organised crime and fighting with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the council of government security and government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 murders . this equ@@ ates to an average of 8,5 murders per day .
these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories live in the face of always new headlines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers , which has tor@@ mented the country in the past four decades , in an understand@@ able manner .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sh@@ aring is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Viking ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages where it is linked , include pictures on which violence is represented .
the factor check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ our or fake a fake .
but how is the years immer@@ sed for the first time ? content in social media , whether it is true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to endure further .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it was de@@ ferred to mis@@ leading trage@@ dies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false copy of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft news - den@@ ies not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker trucks crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to the victims .
the representative described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinemas near , which was full of people who illustrate the football World Cup .
houses bo@@ oted and captured cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ant to the unknown .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ several photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ful scenes of this day .
up above is an example .
it displays rows of tigh@@ tened body , which are rounded up on the ground , while persons are watching them .
but here the story is not its end .
over the years the same photograph was taken over several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but did not seem to be attributed to related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities where they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and car@@ cases were burned in streets and building .
reports were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed behind to count bodies , &quot; said a population on Human Rights Watch .
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up can only be illustrated by satellite imag@@ ery .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ explained , but the army @-@ base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was due as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this dis@@ mis@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of ab@@ norm@@ alities ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings .
another step further , this example illustrates the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge joined the deadly tracking of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in connection with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee strokes , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ di @-@ Arab News page , which did fal@@ sely alleged that President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ a has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to educ@@ ate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed recently on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies , AFP , as their source called , had also attributed to Th@@ a witness this statement , but did not put the picture from the DR Congo in connection .
the world wide range of false information
tracks of this wrong coupling range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; you can see how far information could cross borders .
a reverse picture search with the search@@ engine of Tin@@ Eye has found 344 at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 images which are very similar to the image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mask of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried other attempts to un@@ mask the fake .
we have been examples of mis@@ use and used them in connection with the respective countries , on the basis of whose page they had been published . thus , we want to display the range of clear@@ er than by the language alone .
from the listed countries ( which were linked in some cases also linked to each other ) , several samples can be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases where you can still be tra@@ pped ( on the map in orange ) :
card : News fra@@ mes .
country examples of false cou@@ plings from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ based countries refer to pages or servers , which are still available on the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ seh@@ ood .
the countries in grey are examples which are available according to met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably even counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one page , which leaves rum@@ ours , asked that the af@@ ore@@ mentioned photo Christians were killed , which were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this contribution a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only mention the mis@@ notification , but also discuss the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions after the intention of the people and the resulting trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) .
this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica is quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( whereby it is not known whether the original report included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ posts after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one , used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam . clearly , no pages have seen such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .

this article focuses on the continuous emergency of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but rec@@ ites the work of an article in Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of Indian Express had not included this picture at the time of the publication of our contribution .

this page used the image as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ erian Christians .
this asser@@ tion was rejected by a Greek fact check @-@ check @-@ page in 2013 and once again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a association of students of the@@ ology of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims across the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .

even within Nigeria the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am bombar@@ d@@ ings in the Kan@@ o public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example for an in@@ mis@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand side a Twe@@ et , the sympathy over the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , given to del@@ ous@@ ing because the photos of these were ab@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the government of Myanmar published a judge in order to abol@@ ish the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings regarding Myanmar . &quot;
this correc@@ t@@ ance which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that har@@ ate the h@@ ate speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Muslims and elsewhere ( which is often widely distributed by bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , referring to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly empha@@ sized that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ a had been involved in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and is still included in this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article about students who have been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from the now deleted , the Catholic near the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly stated that the picture was not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ ron@@ age attack . &quot;
when the picture later joined the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ ery@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fer@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion under Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events that were alleged in the name of the Islam@@ s , a greater attention .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was tagged as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were linked to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the target to set attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Pascal &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre had been in circulation , translated discussions like this one on Vietnamese and declared it to the mis@@ point .
from the message in which the picture taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , ag@@ gregation and pages in the following countries ( in the portfolio in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye has too , are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entry with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp ) exist in the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and co@@ ro@@ oted over image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all of these cases , which appeared clearly after the original disaster of 2010 , the picture may eventually be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames ( frame ) that go through this post . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions regarding the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued as a European or French life .
religion understanding and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examine how images are used in the context of these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer give this pictures longer .
with social media , there are many people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally inf@@ lic@@ ated the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ ger this mood of mal@@ - and mis@@ mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and is the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of non@@ violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the ref@@ usal to recognise pictures of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images even demands of the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and viewers des@@ ti@@ ze their ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study who sought to work as violent media to help others ) .
while there are some regards to non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you &apos;ll have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests something that is actually possible , or completely ab@@ stain@@ ed from the context or on completely mis@@ used way .
an investigation of false conc@@ essions , however , should also take into account how internationally they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Simmons is used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. in@@ separ@@ able ) endeav@@ oured to offer language enthusiastic about words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others that are ro@@ oted in a specific culture ( for example , the Spanish pedal ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to every attempt of an easy translation .
a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation , and sometimes something context are required to understand what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been gathered for a long time in an online list .
most of these lists deal Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on little languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s VAT , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Dimen@@ sions around your parents in recognition of how to stri@@ ve yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ ure language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - Com@@ mit@@ ment or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being washed in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds in his own words about :
they dis@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , reveal other ideas and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you can analyse , analyze how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .

just like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is now one of the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ scap@@ ed disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally continues at the end of May , are caused by heavy rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country via the banks .
following a position of the disaster vent@@ ing of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and s@@ lag .
over 400 000 people have been affected by last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure residence .
the rain desc@@ ends on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waters in some areas were slowly going back slowly .
health and hygiene by the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in un@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water stocks of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka Twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly curse the den@@ gu@@ e@@ ousness crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ ins are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle is also flooded because of the last water p@@ eg@@ s of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are made to transport of emergency supplies for the residents made in their flooded villages .
various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also been declared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on high water situation and humanitarian aid .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they led a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key , which included more than one thousand requests and 150 successful driver actions for the result of high water and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this has prevented the loss of other human lives , the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

use of t.@@ Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts to her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call Par@@ ols for women &apos;s rights .
in the next line , we have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some think the iconic painting of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ il@@ ding par@@ ol@@ ises against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; These things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their performance .
they were mus@@ li@@ fied me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be Muslim on different species but somehow we are all plug@@ ged in the same Muslim @-@ drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims who do not fit there un@@ fit , is mus@@ cled .
Desig@@ ned to be cancelled
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t stand alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is even the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western presentation , religion is f@@ aded Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this is a big part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the re@@ forming images of Muslims to colonial the western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting sculp@@ ting is determined by the dark man , one should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientists Edward Said performed the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood remain ste@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly .
I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how this powerful , defective nar@@ rative can domin@@ ate our new@@ s@@ feeds .
this nar@@ rative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the US could not even choose her first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ rative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are inhi@@ bited , their head scarf in public buildings , and Saudi Muslim , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exer@@ ts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ ra@@ tively weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change .
it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afri@@ cans , which were hi@@ ther@@ fore by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has seized our collective pre@@ conception , deep and f@@ law@@ ed , that often Si@@ kh men and children become an@@ tim@@ eli@@ us@@ ical attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
due to these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , the religion but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
among the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed and failed to capture the 1.7 billion sp@@ ra@@ tively .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ bar@@ ge Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the natives of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made by the Muslim , American mathemati@@ cian from Bangladesh by name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was re @-@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were irre@@ voc@@ ally Muslims and Americans .
but am I wrong for the Muslim and American ?
sometimes , if people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or make my handy hand@@ ker@@ chiefs who carry all Muslims - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m jo@@ king , we do not wear all T@@ ash@@ k@@ or@@ ane with us .
we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who endeav@@ our to combat widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ opho@@ bia , think @-@ tanks and experts for mis@@ information which is our already f@@ law@@ ed picture of what is a Muslim ; or of which Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a fore@@ ig@@ ner , who supp@@ ress a woman the head@@ scarf .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim became a Muslim but I was four years old when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they rely on the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend would see my neighbor , my neighbor , my rock in the surf that I am the Muslim I could look through the 15 @-@ meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the whole ritual with my daughter , when I kept them silent in my arms , and her Arabian verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ os@@ us .
I repeat three times each of them .
I ask therefore that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother with her sisters ; as they had a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi before decades .
it is the picture of her that I have seen my eyes on this moment : nano , surrounded by their accomplished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi @-@ Holy ; and one Kor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen capit@@ als that it can virtually impossible .
to be Muslim , signi@@ fying prayers that she had said to me , if I have a bad day .
to be Muslim , as she has taught me to refer to God , Allah mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation that was gover@@ ned by a &quot; Empire &quot; - by a &quot; Empire &quot; by name , a company with the name hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ ums @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ia , it has a deep meaning , God , to call my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
affili@@ ation means to grow and to hear that men should not weep , but at the same time to see that my dar@@ ling grandfather wept .
forced end@@ rin , while he writes of books on modern Islam and over the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan un@@ disputed about his family in India , ruled that he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families were torn apart by my grandfather , by colonial @-@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake risk .
to be Muslim , to know that in the past two centuries Europeans have committed all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means that the first fli@@ pper was thrown off from a century over a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , Hebrew sub@@ subject to the British Empire , called &quot; dangerous &quot; newspapers , led to the first mosque in England .
before there were planes , he traveled in more parts of the world as I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , we go back to our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ touched history .
it means to remember that four@@ teen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed throughout the continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , who have gone to Iraq in order to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means that when a tragedy is home to the US and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means that four tens of years ago , the first prayer calls , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves .
it means that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country .
it means Malcolm X call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel as people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an American woman , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Punj@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identity , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the scar of 1.7 billion poses more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing bi@@ dity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a mother means to care for my child and to care all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in the Muslim states that began with President Bush and have been extended to President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the hi@@ kes , who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that equ@@ ates its borders towards people from just countries which are bombar@@ ded .
it &apos;s a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly list , &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims into the sight .
there are the wars that we will lead and the bombs , which we throw in Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell us today , we are here .
in a study by A@@ scent of Man , researchers at North@@ western University participants demonstrated a scientific picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims were the lowest points .
the conversation we must lead
we are deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we are decades back to recognise the roots of our fears and the defective and dangerous expression that we ste@@ er into our news @-@ editors .
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which attempts to capture our multiple with bin@@ aries and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; the vir@@ g@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , increases Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I &apos;m concerned because of this difficult global time , in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that would go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who exist in the dark corners of the Internet , now run the White House .
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by making the &quot; others &quot; created .
a few years ago , it had not yet been given it ; now they rule large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I &apos;m concerned about the re@@ alities and the history that I was not aware , as I was so old now , as it was now my daughter , but those who have made me become an un@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread cro@@ oked track in my speech .
things that perhaps wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ se@@ ections , that makes our humanity , is l@@ ur@@ king a story where someone is made a &quot; others . &quot;

initiative for nar@@ rative arts wants to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ yt@@ eller count , by Flick@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be an option , right here and now , in spite of a language barrier with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer to that .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the unmistak@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the diversity of great cities and appreciate .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not admitted to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the world may be avoided , when we create cities which must not forget the diversity - in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to .
while &quot; listening often is connected to understand , &quot; check these events instead &quot; the listen@@ ers to appreciate , to feel , connect . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers set their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dev@@ otion and their representation are showing that the listen@@ ers can rely on it .
they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional history from Burkina Faso , which is told in language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou also takes the opportunity to explain the country &apos;s typical customs of stories .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak from H@@ oses and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having explained the meaning of his be@@ ak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that your language does not understand ? &quot; with a wide Gr@@ in@@ ses he shares his feeling of the Bible :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities and the organis@@ ers are hoping to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in contact with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ation of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the Pu@@ ky Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens on the Neur@@ examination of the debt ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church assembly , Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ fixing of debt also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demanded that politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities , who are responsible for debts , are responsible for their corruption .
we call for a financial testing and a tap committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions according to the re@@ mun@@ eration that acts in favor of the economy .
we will be pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not find themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not in the State of the United States - is suffering from a heavy financial crisis .
thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a pro @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization , without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o @-@ economic development , a law to state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing stat@@ ute view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed by the outside without participation and conviction of the citizens risk to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration was called the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;

the sy@@ ri@@ cally @-@ Palestinian web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi is known for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continued to support the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference for the digital culture , which was al@@ igned to Berlin , dedicated a event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of France based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Rü@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; completed books within three to five days , l@@ apped excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ . ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) .
the book that has been published last year and is free here , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is an homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss the movements of free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researcher and authors , who have been involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to look beyond the m@@ ist , which gives our new@@ s@@ feeds and create a little sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the Ad@@ ra @-@ pris@@ ons &apos; directory , where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bass@@ el has given a high price for his participation in free culture , many of us start to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary beliefs ?
the web@@ developer of open source and digital activ@@ ism has been part of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; signed command from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who referred to as Insider in the Assad government and reported it from an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and state remain unknown , however .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in providing access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the head of the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bass@@ el &apos;s cultural prototypes were looking ahead of the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ cross of many ci@@ vil@@ is@@ ations and merge in Greek @-@ Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work that the IS would put everything on it , this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ pping move to the digital archae@@ ology and preservation has created a time capsule set to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ al@@ u@@ able value .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my entire life with it , of freedom to dream and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who has asked . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught others , as they use computers at least theore@@ tically , without knowing that they actually kept one in their hands .
in addition , G@@ ha@@ zi is the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ ver@@ st , which she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book a year .
she mu@@ red the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he translated them from the Arab in English .
the book is available free of licence .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; :
it happens to every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that , in the moment , I left the wor@@ rying , in which we embrace us ,
that every one of the dangers is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and watch@@ men
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I went in every detail to your voice and words .
whom I carry with passion for me ,
if your eyes say Le@@ be@@ Well
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my in@@ sol@@ itude ,
to get all the moments back ,
and to weep and smile on your absence .
I testify to myself , that I will return soon ...

Bass@@ el &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
according to the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5.000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : because of corruption , he was re @-@ dismissed director after arrest again
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique responded to a corruption raid against which a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for contamination of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , the Council Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately requested his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company , what happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with a statement by the General Prosecutor of the Republic , which gave the application , there would be no obstac@@ le for Cam@@ b@@ aza to return to its old posts , since the company was not working in prison after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants does not provide the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short of C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle to re@@ locate the director of the company :
puts a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clear the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back in regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP .
what we have to know is that the company would have introduced a discipl@@ in@@ arian process against the contra@@ dic@@ tory .
the company remained silent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behavior as well and considered the case as &quot; resi@@ due &quot; :
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them served .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but when he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company which he helped harm .
therefore , it &apos;s obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .

bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil tell the director no mor@@ ality :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he lied him , I cannot believe that someone had rewarded somebody in such a way , which has already off@@ ended the state so massive .
Cam@@ b@@ aza l@@ acks to return mor@@ ality and serve the state * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has not allowed himself to operate on the state instead .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was used to state the state as a handy man &apos;s source of money and the state itself is tired of this man , who was charged and finally condemned to a long term imprisonment .
hon@@ estly , I do not know why this man was rewarded .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network accepted its posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although more than the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely low con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists as hate crimes against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight anti @-@ speech in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; likes to be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself is not automatically called Hass@@ elt .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use , cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ dens words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequences such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , the chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pairs &apos; ( spi@@ der &apos; ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ Twitter A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words by the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way if they could know how to lin@@ king his back pain , making a word play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; Cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ur is the opinion that she should reduce hate @-@ language nation@@ alists , but also empha@@ sized that Facebook has to be analy@@ tic before it dis@@ semin@@ ate all Po@@ sts who dis@@ semin@@ ate rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what it should do instead , is carefully analy@@ sing and control the mail by checking the following words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) .
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading throughout the language , will receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise her nation@@ alism .
while the promotion has a powerful signal to all of them that use anti @-@ language , the efficiency of this strategy can &apos;t hold long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that c@@ ens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new gui@@ del@@ ine of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and sharing of contents for 24 hours , because the post &quot; the Facebook community did not say . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of hosts of people who have no negative inten@@ tions or that simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the hate ide@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism are in the country badly .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community around advice :
Facebook likes a well @-@ wanted goal to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words is to give even more hatred within the various communities .
moreover , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and as words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; peas cur@@ ry &quot; have been prohibited .
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t tried to rec@@ ti@@ fy the fal@@ cons .
if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefit that would make them a great turnover , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic Z@@ ens@@ orship has provided much reproach among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now do funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation to see if their posts are taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts that were not ab@@ stain@@ ed : but still removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and look at the peas cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
just to try out whether Facebook has the mail removed , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should stimul@@ ate violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to talk out of hate speech to his bur@@ m@@ ese pages , critic@@ ised .
but rather than simply ending the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have better running , rather to see in context than on Code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is close with the children &apos;s toe
a wedding ring in sand .

the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously decided a law that this practice is to offer , so that the recommended age is now at 18 .
before this change of adul@@ terer , some members held more du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country was gathered that the state shouldn &apos;t inter@@ fere , as that , at age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ noticed by the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contrac@@ tor of the UN Children Rights Court , the min@@ ors , as men under 18 years . &quot;
statistics of UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married with 15 in Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central Office confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married .
online petitions and social media movements that were anxi@@ ous to abol@@ ish laws on the children &apos;s toe , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced . no doubt they helped to take this result .
nevertheless not everything went smoothly .
an Hindu leaders , Z. B. had no concerns to say the critics of the child , they should take care of their own matters . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition promoted tensions within this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there came doubts if the opposition would agree to the bill of law .
but in early 2017 the bill of bill was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook a status update that Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle again posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of bill against child @-@ before was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it .
after having decided in the Senate , the draft is now able to become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws have finally been changed to children .
Facebook member Lov@@ el Francis , who was a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary smell that has lost the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago , and that is almost every price .
while Abel &apos;s Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ishing the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public review on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent News !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for that - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which is quite open , said how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the recommended age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent from the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft on the change of adul@@ terer was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all MPs , who were logged in , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s before is not allowed to law in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ fish .
many thanks to all the activists who made him out .
congratulations .
thank you to our M@@ EPs .
but a possible h@@ ooks comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu @-@ organisation of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj had announced his intention to under@@ take judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to dissolve his promise .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a dis@@ advoc@@ ate of the law , meant that it would be justified if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , the most social media users wanted to deal differently on the subject .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear satellite , if we think instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that we would need to talk about the problem , that the state , our daughters , protects them , that they may be ab@@ used for large , hard @-@ headed men , which are against them in the advantage , would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , if it comes to a judicial court against the law or not , this law is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children &apos;s children are legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that they are prohibited .

on Sunday morning the Office of the public news service Y@@ ar@@ News announced that they were h@@ acked .
with the mir@@ r@@ oring of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia @-@ page was published on January 18 , 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the USA , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month the Turkey closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
day for day is more evident , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and journalists and fans of TV series fight against the lock .
although many techni@@ qu@@ ated Internet users are used to use over@@ h@@ aul tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times also reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been edited by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University have been selected , regular blocking of the Internet has been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are now several mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ faces File System ) , when the platform lay down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain name and thus making a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is available in the current prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after having heard the messages ( via the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything to complete snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the contents of de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users check out at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was conducted regardless of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and any live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pe@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to ho@@ sten to similar mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , an Mir@@ ror .
one gets to another URL , which is not the original . that which one can then see is from Wikipedia .
basically the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese game photographer doesn &apos;t use his camera to attentive to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ preme rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he saw around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motives and balanced colors .
the motivated him to wear a camera to wear and try to gra@@ ve the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to bring Nepal on the international stage .
and his home town just beside Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct your attention to Nepal wildlife .
he described Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps to work with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world heritage . what could be better give for a passionate wildlife photographers ! !
I rested just at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) stopped . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be .
the river is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river , where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to gn@@ ash pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar pursu@@ es a collaboration with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding of that wild animals are not so frigh@@ tening as they look like .
and he should know that , as he was standing up to face from face to face ,
a tiger can not inter@@ fere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
I was also because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he immediately starts to see us and he star@@ ed me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ter . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and took six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds that live near the tourist information .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women for the first time , to address the names of their husbands ,
women in the small Indian village of Gum@@ la Jam Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .
photo by Flick@@ r user Chris Fre@@ eman .
CC B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India .
a re@@ designed version was once again published as part of an content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid their greatest care , the names of their husbands , or even of elderly men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women allow her to respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state O@@ il@@ a by a p@@ seudo @-@ court and viol@@ ate from their family and the village community after having called a married relations with his name .
the tradition of their wives are also not called by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer assign@@ ments whenever possible , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health professionals and house@@ wives , a unique club , thus became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone where they discuss the hos@@ tility of patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss .
one of the 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is involved in the mining of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s he@@ ats up to the associations of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports how this club created a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously at the ambassador of the mur@@ als .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini , showed in their discussion round , was of women who don &apos;t call their husbands in their name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
the name of their husbands , not according to pron@@ ounce , is a ro@@ man , whom they count all in@@ jus@@ tification and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes it a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as a beg@@ gar , as woman without mor@@ ality .
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we have never thought to have thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who previously named her husband , never called on the name , wanted to try at home , as it goes .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weigh long after the video was at the end .
my husband , my husband , turned herself to me , and said , I should call him by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the baggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion lu@@ b .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor ever before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem at Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us as they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women will never speak the name of their husbands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , she was afraid of herself in the whole exercise ; another decided to leave the whole , fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
in addition to the ad@@ renal@@ ine , you have decided to have broken their husbands at home in fact , that they would actually attempt to name their husbands in their name .
and they held their word .
in the next days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put to women in their head : his wife could not stop asking his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner prior to the whole family .
when her mother in mother was stub@@ born , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understand@@ able and the situation was given in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tries to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the marriage status :
why must only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he would like it .
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to carry him .
the other women did not have stopped completely with that , but mean that they are now in a better position to choose it , not to wear it in some days .
for many women the discussion lu@@ b is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; we do a trip in any discussion lu@@ b .
usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to make sure what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang , and spoke about things that they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things , such as our identi@@ ties on our husbands , never been so honest .
it feels great to say some things to say loud , no matter how small they can occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them is okay , but some wanted a sage @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt with a pants , wear ; they didn &apos;t know themselves .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own h@@ ind , mor@@ als associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , ding@@ g@@ gel@@ te Roh@@ ini her own pair Cur@@ tas ( upper inhibit@@ ors ) into a discussion round , so the women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they can create it .
the question is , whether in the five months since its first discussion lu@@ b , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly moving into rolls :
we have made only little steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of their husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and not any other family members .
only one or two say the names of their husbands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in discussion lu@@ b know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ ooth@@ es of more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , it is aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :

on June 29 of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was susp@@ icious of the mar@@ riages of the million ( Beatles @-@ memorial day ) in the Japanese t@@ witter trend , which many fans re@@ vo@@ ke their memories and share their appreciation for the Beatles .
the Beatles visit in 1966 in Japan is regarded as the turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964 , marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beatles have been in the country , but this was enough to turn the Japanese .
the people here is quite quick to realise that they had no other choice when the Beatles have received open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka told President of the retail series Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan . nearly 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo .
even today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke @-@ bars and in the English lessons of Japanese medium schools .
the put@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today The Beatles Memorial Day .
we all love the Beatles in our house .
I do not know whether this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll John Lenn@@ on should be present or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the known places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beatles , you are your 5 places you need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) Penn@@ y Lane
5 ) ( From the link to The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be quir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today The Beatles Memorial Day .
exactly today in the year 1966 The Beatles started the first time in Japan .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made up for a pilgrimage to London and slept through the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base as well as for example , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese pasta ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! ! today The Beatles Memorial Day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll listen to myself today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ achts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat the R@@ amen noodles with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is lost .
so , we hope you are !

a new system of kidn@@ apping persons for organizational , probably for super@@ believing purposes , presumably the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to life to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men in the district of Mil@@ k were killed , few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were collected .
two men were arrested and in the after@@ math that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been exploited .
there will be local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a believing man could bring gold @-@ old or wealth , explained the police pre@@ acher of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered on smooth @-@ member men in Mozambique .
another group that is the objective of assass@@ inations for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in South African country led a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government &apos;s campaign to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .

he warned those who have planned to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who are travelling to Mozambique are a target ritual attack , warned the Muslim police according to the latest assassination of three believing men based on their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the murdered were held .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ urban in the south of Mozambique said that the local police have already been following :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of believing men .
the persecution and murder of believing individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has existed for presumably aber@@ g ritu@@ als in order to represent the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bet@@ ting ( PR@@ M ) , which also exist that a faith existed , according to which the victims were in power , the wealth of riches .
in the last days , three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the Chronicle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty , Mozambique is faced :
I would like to ask GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH would have to go on the road , and if they would not viol@@ ate their lives , and other achievements , a nation in which the people are hun@@ ted , or even their lives , to become a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os or even &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to aim to get to grab their wealth .
despite the phenomena of phenomena , some had the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren humor .

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , probably made only recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in international community attention , after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to liver cancer in the end stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he was involved in the draft of Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that tells the democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
in China , Li@@ us &apos;s case referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a speaker tells that he was not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China still receives orders from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , to free or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ thered .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
a speaker , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway fell into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2010 , although the Norwegian government failed to do nothing with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed until December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to re@@ distribute the salmon crew to China , since the exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee made his hope for an un@@ conditional release to an expression and invited Liu to obtain his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention he was not able to meet his price .
Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was promp@@ ted to free Liu and his wife immediately free of house arrest and allow him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called Li@@ us for the release of Li@@ us , as she ha@@ sted in a statement on 30 June :
we are expecting to see China &apos;s limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife , as well as family members .
they are supposed to meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told him that Americans would have the opportunity for treatment abroad , unless it is provided to him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , gave the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy was to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia to free his house arrest .
the US Embassy revealed a fur@@ ious response from China to themselves , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country has the right to en@@ for@@ en@@ ish and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal matters . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom , such as travel agents and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they have legally entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international comm@@ itments .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision to push the Chinese government to push away Liu and his wife un@@ conditional .
I urge China to un@@ lock the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally to give it a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
on July 3 , Berlin , the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu &apos;s all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G20 and 8th of July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters , that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could o@@ vers@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on June 28 , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China invited Liu to provide an adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to provide himself from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AFP that Li@@ us Mrs , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always allowed the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks about :
Canada calls on China to adopt its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , to preserve and un@@ locked the rights of this rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called on China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , regardless where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may contact him .
although the news of France info reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there would be no further information if France will ultimately absorb him .
Taiwan
the Council of Fest@@ land@@ in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Liu , and to show a greater tolerance to those who demand peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the t@@ ai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ is@@ ers Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party called China also to allow the dise@@ ased intellectual Liu to handle in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried about Liu , expl@@ aining that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being .
he spoke about Liu :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly pen@@ alised , led to a harmon@@ ious , stable , and weal@@ thy China , which again contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally really moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , signed by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was to be considered a town .
this remark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the ministers observed that many people critic@@ ise the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore , because they compared to Singapore with other countries .
it is supported that Singapore was to be considered a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the minister of justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing Auth@@ or@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country , you can say that we ultimately won &apos;t be a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a flight before the responsibilities , a must inf@@ rin@@ gement .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; ordinary countries &apos; , in view of whose , he appeared in@@ sof@@ ter un@@ democratic .
in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , alike cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re has emerged from the author@@ itative mach@@ inations , leaving the demo@@ cr@@ ats , leaving logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial authorities , our political system really non @-@ answers .
appropriate questions , he de@@ clo@@ aked with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clear his opinion as she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our wer@@ er K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point if it was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing on the blog , he shows that it should begin to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ avoid@@ able even if we are looking forward to free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he missed Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities would like to win a party for decades ? ) .
when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment over Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ian statement as leader of an increasing generation .
I &apos;m talking about what the Minister of Justice has said to Singapore , ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , which I expected - would I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is real and aware of what he defended .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review speci@@ fies the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams argument :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am have committed a mistake &quot; or was it a fre@@ ud@@ der loud@@ speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government office , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister invo@@ ices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
once the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to be the year , Singapore is always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true .
we should speak rather of the city &apos;s defence .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most mis@@ placed aspect about your residence or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ours of certain parts of the world uncovered , and another Fac@@ ets should be shown .
the newest part of this series is Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is provided to me in Japan is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation is taking place , it is regarded as cour@@ teous to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
in my clari@@ fication , the standard response is usually followed : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice @-@ hockey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans are perhaps cooking in front of anger when they are kept for Americans , but does not distur@@ b me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know it , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans spend a Canadian flag well on their back@@ pack when they are travelling .
everybody love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , however , ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn little map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marriage in Canada has been legal since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada , too , is believed to be the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like those types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends who I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t account for me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
firstly : as &quot; nice &quot; means to be called , as the good , gentle , gentle , gentle , but trag@@ ically , in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders , &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada really had a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can meet .
harmless , being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn and no attention .
this can be something good if you want to be un@@ noticed in the background , away from things that pass around one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say , that the desire to be free and alone , is a master of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what out@@ si@@ ders listed as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t talk about the fence with its neighbors .
we l@@ acks hot hear@@ ted , open kindness , which I have now connect to my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odic Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band has released a music video , which took the power in 2014 , and re@@ affir@@ med the civilian government in 2014 , and continues to gover@@ n the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend .
although not politically , the music video refers to the continued military power of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for song was a huge success .
only within the first three days the video uploaded to Facebook 1.@@ 254 and received 8,@@ 800 rec@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; was blocked by the dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand after a group of activists trained to watch this video .
you can interpre@@ t the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as special as the situation in the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
have a look at these videos of the video which relate to some of the political topics , which have been har@@ ness@@ ing in Thailand during the last three years .
the 44 rules of girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section of 44 of the provisional constitution , which is the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the header &apos;s absolute decision .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic by the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal law , its vag@@ ue and un@@ clear rules often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , supervised the online content and persons accused of having rejected the monarchy and prosec@@ ute the grounds of criminal responsibility .
Thailand sets a strict drawing against &quot; L@@ esis Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty of poverty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax rate .
in the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before you bring them into an inter@@ ven@@ tional camp , another problem may occur .
some journalists are sitting in the prison , because they allegedly caused the confusion of &quot; confusion &quot; in society and serve Internet users , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut , &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during protests in 2014 .
life goes on to the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asien

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and published here with friendly auth@@ orization .
the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering only very slowly in East @-@ Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ an War was officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbohydr@@ ate basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , sc@@ asi@@ es , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and ha@@ v@@ ens live in the area .
such settlements are called ghost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these viol@@ ins .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ ovo , symbo@@ lic@@ ally stand for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .

he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ?
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens , which served all the community .
now there is only paved road with amazing spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and focused her contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , meanwhile abandoned the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the Gei@@ ster@@ stadt D@@ z@@ han@@ k@@ ha .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which are still one or two families , recogni@@ zes on the balconies , where the laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she discover me with the camera in his hand , they immediately go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to let us take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend and suddenly leaving the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sid@@ y industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult about the laps to come .
the district administration provides free candles in winter , and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
in spite of her eldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left Ab@@ ch@@ asien in France to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she is supporting her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly install@@ ments are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls her aun@@ t G@@ alya to her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cchini .
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children living in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , they remind people of the village in front of the war .
despite the relative that living in central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ es broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative building in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but that is still going to take something , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children for each child .
her husband works in the carbon@@ ic ruin .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens once was , they keep pigs , cows , h@@ uts and chickens .
she tells us that initially a very frigh@@ tening situation was , as many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her fears .

&quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark streets or a few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building was destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has a bit to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation turned to the end , a little boy goes over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy ch@@ ased him back .
he plays with the ball , which then rolling the hills .
a group of children now write the ball .
while they run , some of them throw rocks on the falling buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , who care for uncertainty in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and published here with friendly auth@@ orization .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places will be known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink bri@@ tish frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are in transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with grinding , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for hotel - however , there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full mini@@ buses and from the top of the coast they start to cry out : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the time it &apos;s more quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also been sleeping on cart@@ ons outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she helps them also and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy medications that they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that drew from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived at a short time .
I asked him if Mama is a fair nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her since African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very lov@@ ingly .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels to Boston with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard by other directions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the way and that Afri@@ cans speak already on What@@ s@@ App of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
as many of his followers Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was we@@ aker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the ticket ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests have often send text messages if they are gone to greet them , to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city there is a imp@@ asse to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ciano .
this winter , Valencia and his family received migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman , and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants .
he has started to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking location outside .
Valen@@ cian declares that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they &apos;re experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants open also the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to press him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , one of the sole , has offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , trav@@ ellers consul@@ ted their teleph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has got 20 new guests , a majority of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud Grand@@ mother she bl@@ az@@ eth her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ es who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers more , boy and old .
she laughs at sad@@ ness , while she introduces them shortly .
Ya se fu@@ er@@ one , &quot; repe@@ ats every time every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
one check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ users have an average of one &apos;s and said .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on July 10 , the phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi were given a cell phone notification where the District government refers to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication message , the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells us that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities n@@ oses to use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app before they were installed with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was to determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activity and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online fraud , Tro@@ users and ph@@ ishing sites to make users alert as much time they spend online , and remote control of their own home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can , of course , be used in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers capable to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications of digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority interests like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict regions , the authorities often order extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and security measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ic Internet .
the media @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( per@@ cent@@ ration in China ) , the cen@@ sored news in China , displayed photos of a chec@@ kl@@ ist at which polic@@ emen have checked the residents out if they had the monitoring app installed .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they comp@@ elled the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ growing technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( per@@ cent@@ ration of the mar@@ riages ! ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which highlights that the software can lift up a Windows operating system and receives un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard disk .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minim@@ ize the distribution of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities , and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office on the operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a decree involving all residents and entrepreneurs , up to August 1 their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy this action , however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible publishers , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane was portra@@ yed his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and you are determined that you are completely gone on one place where everything is important .
everything has dis@@ band@@ ed and dis@@ band@@ ed and revealed to a truth , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside .
one that makes their name all honor .
one who has defeated itself in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if you pick up the reality and look behind the scenes , beyond the acting , beautiful scenes and actor , the characters into being of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubt , rise up in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even when the earth is on the axis of your salvation . you know that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , built stone to stone .
they have arrested me and my father thri@@ ce three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough to allow me to form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the leader of the security services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he presented his power over us by proving even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five teenagers have been torn apart during a peaceful prot@@ esting like dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to remove the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was silent , ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even though I had no high demands on a city leading up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ments .
in the third night the things had a little cal@@ med after the power supply in the neighborhood had to work .
I broke the silence by shou@@ ting several times of &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through silence .
few minutes later , some of my friends were cour@@ ageous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us in a splendid picture that filled my expectations and fully fulfilled .
at such a moment , you are aware that you are delivered the spirit from the lamp , but it is just not interested in Ger@@ ing@@ sten .
I received a call from my father : &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return to you your voice , after you gave it all the way to the Office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot;
his eyes filled eyes were set on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dream of what to look at me in the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure when I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I &apos;ve never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such disast@@ rous consequences for me , but I don &apos;t regret my word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cont@@ ention of this curse lies to me today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ian torture which I was suspended for months .
I penet@@ rating the farm .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
afterwards , through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I prepared the details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they have shared a bigger cell this time .
I have to share it with only one another det@@ ain@@ ees , and should set me immediately , without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I hold back on an old @-@ tried communication method : to beat the fist against the wall .
I learned that my companion was a &quot; sin@@ cer@@ ain@@ ling . &quot;
after long hes@@ it@@ ating , he ultimately answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected man @-@ aged man who sees me similar and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there is no striking facial features , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers provide its existence .
perhaps he was re@@ located in one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would release him if I stay .
liar .
I would like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row , to drive all these crow@@ s , who lab@@ s on the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance I can hear them scre@@ am still &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the scre@@ am , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Black saw the colour of corruption , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the grey light in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; shot on 13th sh@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; you are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
this was the secret : to protect the state security before us and avoid that we release the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ an dial@@ ect . they played their con@@ fession@@ al map and betra@@ y the close perspectives of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of her c@@ lans into a hero .
I cared for the interro@@ g@@ ation and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the expressions that were astonished at him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start to join with your life as you join this day@@ time , and to protest demonstrations soon anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I &apos;m acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to me , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say no more , when ins@@ ults and strokes after a friendly conversation for me has become a common communication medium .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to being punished , although I had done nothing to make this penalty .
a punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the &quot; lov@@ ingly &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the mon@@ arch .
your hen remembers your cry .
give Him a pleasure , you can not measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your scre@@ am .
my cry made him not enough , so they cast out the tube through a cable .
when I first asked , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector , or if that was part of the normal working class .
they had four cables in each other to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour , three of them changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice , which I listened to scre@@ am .
the Hen@@ ker re@@ marked the cooling and did not find any favor in it , so it was the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect power manager .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two aw@@ ful hours he decided that he had done his duty to this night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to go to sleep again . let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father has to worry terrible troubles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by aman Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he turns to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but on what you can depend , is a cig@@ ar between his fingers or his du@@ ot@@ ine @-@ picked lips .
he lives in the Supreme Court of his family house which has been among them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel met his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ y@@ een ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , who is being transferred to the conservative majority and exploration of gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , often concerned with issues such as Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugee , he also demands the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only found in his home town of Amman , but also in cities that spread from Damascus in Syria by far to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at his age 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted in its thinking , and he can have compassion on their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it openly , he triumph@@ ed with US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation &quot; - so he himself describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sel@@ ingly hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the coins speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ den of the K@@ ent C@@ igar@@ ette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you take a look into neighbouring countries .
it is therefore easy to do it simply to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to get stuck in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry called Jord@@ anians a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila cancelled , already for the second time .
some par@@ liament@@ arians , who support the Islamic Emirate - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , contra@@ di@@ ct the main reason for the concert night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was canc@@ eled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim to claim the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , Human Rights and free expression in the Arab world , which represents the ancient legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to integrate &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement may be probably not simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but rather an evident @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ fying reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s plant clearly .
in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , traditional family @-@ care about body , con@@ stituted his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly written , unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them , they should actually trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary de &apos; has increased to the un@@ official out@@ wards .
according to Human Rights Watch , according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary citizens in 2016 reached its peak ; however , the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support women , victims attempted murder or domestic violence , to the appropriate manner .
according to a law on crime control from 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of in@@ appropriate violence , &quot; and for their release often is a years of bureaucra@@ tic expendi@@ tures as well as the warranty of the family needs nothing to happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to rever@@ ting issues , which were g@@ ging for a long time in its country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , but he grants us that he &apos;s his music , the full explic@@ it attraction on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , can not separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
I was saying to me , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question about the Palestinian identity in the attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; there &apos;s focus on poverty .
the list of songs that are politically active in the core , can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song the verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , in which one can , in his words , &quot; that can be what you want &quot; - whether it is Faith or Non@@ sense , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noticed that no one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to notice that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been cen@@ sored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a worked version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance of homosexu@@ als do not de@@ duct Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which still has remained in remembrance thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what was supposed to work even on behalf of the cali@@ ph , in the eighth century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jord@@ ani@@ er do it ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are put to silence .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took part several former government members and members of the Teacher &apos;s Association , with the grounds that they had written down on the comments in social media , linked with the deeply ro@@ oted corruption .
given that , the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs are considering just the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge it is to create structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anians .
for him is progress an independent and take . Jordan has shi@@ fted an appearance on the second time in a row , but the way of progress - such as H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , bed@@ time and internal changes . it is certain that these changes are held from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he doesn &apos;t dream of being his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region will lead to the region using music , art and literature of a real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not through bombs , Stre@@ um@@ uni@@ tions and at artificial nature . at least , he hopes .
until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to ri@@ bs and also resist resistance .
this report was made through the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which aman is considered a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ ula in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one thought that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory is that the drums , the drums and dancing more than one thousand years have come from north @-@ east Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to force the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a couple of great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al .
I have a long time I look at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two side@@ car races just to see .
nonetheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only tru@@ e - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ meter high arm was unbelievable .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

seldom were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug dealers are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - how many other Central and South American countries witnessed a rising demand for aesthetic services to men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the quir@@ ky hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Peru ) , has led to constantly prove more norm@@ alities to the experienced hands of hair@@ dressing who can re@@ produce this hair@@ less hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of Fris@@ bee &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts opposite each other to show who can create the extern@@ ally @-@ cent@@ sten L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there are on the public fac@@ ebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found in El Call@@ ao here , found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to find a training in the hairdres@@ ser &apos;s art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering possibilities dozens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year in March and reported about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ llas
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the printed version of the Beit@@ er &quot; Liebes@@ hoods of guer@@ ri@@ llas , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve has published .
this entry is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to humans we know ?
is there not much more important , people who have out@@ cast out aff@@ ection ?
exactly this question came the two young Colum@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the head and inspired them to write to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconc@@ ile ) , the young people encouraged to write guer@@ ri@@ llas letters .
recently , her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was considered that the signing of the peace treaty was so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but in front of Colombia , it is still a long way to talk about an effective reconciliation and peace .
Guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ ac@@ rob@@ bers , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a rh@@ et@@ or@@ rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock their weapons were forced to integrate into life as a civilian .
the Colom@@ bian society again , which had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred toward guer@@ ri@@ llas , must now be able to support them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colombia is joined together and would help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love stories to former guer@@ ri@@ llas , to welcome them back in the society .
the campaign &apos;s aim is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ llas - which will then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cris@@ tian the opportunity to talk briefly with Kail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014 .
this stated that we love the people we love to write on the day of thousands of love letters , but those who forget them need much necessary .
he plane , he talked further to share his love with people this year , which needed for most urgent additives .
so the plan , letters full of hope and support for former milit@@ ants of the F@@ ARC . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war story to a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters were gathered in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Mani@@ z@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would be par@@ don@@ ed &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ art traveled to the camp to over@@ take letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC wondered how they had previously done to meet the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of supp@@ lication of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of the Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former milit@@ ant led me to the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of refuge in which the guer@@ ri@@ llas living ) looked in , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ llas who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ p@@ er , a le@@ thal weapon in the thorn .
and I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never even in my life has written a bit so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; then suddenly tears walked over the che@@ eks .
I im@@ pover@@ ished him completely , and sat down beside the pom@@ egran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighting , and would help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would give me my mistake .
but now I know that there is a company outside there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned how to handle weapons .
but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the start of the students , students and the F@@ ARC leader came together to a discussion round .
the students were raised up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society in this country more fair .
for a goal of these mag@@ nit@@ ude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said .
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
these people have never found to hear , and had no electoral law , and to recognise that the people I have seen as a monster , and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were shot through their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me , that all men - even those who have killed and done so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a hug .
many former fighters were respon@@ ding to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for instance by Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
colum@@ nist has been prophesi@@ ed that after the dis@@ armament of peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise and prot@@ esting their rights , and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we are now putting peace of the F@@ ARC on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - of all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , afford our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from my own experience , that nothing is easy . those among us who def@@ ending life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be imp@@ ending .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ ual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a great variety of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have experienced the reporting of the past months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ist over the D@@ LGB@@ T community is not just over night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about us what is currently happening in the republic .
several months ago , LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international headlines , after reports that were published , killing torture and killing que@@ ens men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aja Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took susp@@ icious que@@ ere men and a@@ woke them into secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ former was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , her consciously believed that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had learned from the gender equality of their land , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
she was afraid of her life , the last entry into the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day told me that someone needed my help .
it turned out to be a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ former that put into trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen Friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men any more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents were on the round of What@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just doing some shopping bag from the seat of my cars , I heard a male voice : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me .
then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long do you want to honor the family , you ? &quot;
I don &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up the final end of the hospital .
apparently some women had to get all along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which cases were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor stood up and laid me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am thank@@ ful to him that he had passed resp@@ ect@@ fully with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
I got threats from last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , foreigners , some perfectly unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the demanded of sending me to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that everything was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I have to prove it without going up without the roads ; others wanted me to change in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad , and phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have bask@@ ets size C - what would I have to say about television ?
OC Media : how did your family attempts to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people spoke to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the entire Republic .
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
she became too much for my mother , and put a rope around his neck .
luckily , the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into a flat and a few hours later there was a car with a dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a license plate with a 95 .
after the third time it happened , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights @-@ friends check out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to spend their names , but I will say that I remember them all . they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my m@@ um when I arrived .
I bought it , without pre @-@ register , without reference without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a fore@@ ig@@ ner .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment , when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not believe in security , just because you have forsaken the country ?
our people know already , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality , but this is a tab@@ loid .
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asian elements have I still bear in me .
so I wish I would like to overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
if we ch@@ att@@ ing with camera , I actually give myself trouble as the person remembers , which she remembers them from her past - so to my male form .
but that &apos;s very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report on the last week in Washington .
for the needed I needed some latest information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to somebody who had dinner a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an had no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he ended a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives now .
with this , my I , they probably invite the relatives of them , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood is satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says that there would be not many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relations or who were dropped from their relatives to set Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they will be arrested there , so that you can present them later than terrorists .
say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but sub@@ merged to radi@@ alize itself .
OC Media : is that now merely a shifting or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there was nothing new from them since .
they simply took them away .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was involved , when these people were taken away .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports yet . however , we assume that such actions are quite possible .
why else could one not allow this man to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us down to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ci@@ vil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but we finally threw us into the st@@ one@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were kno@@ cked ; I had coloured eyelashes , bore tubes and short tops .
the Ministry of Safety of the Sh@@ aria never gave me a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte did not say about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
one often says to children , if they are happy about the sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes before you shut up because they believed you were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never have insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never ro@@ amed .
OC Media : how long did this gift come from ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking about mor@@ ality in television .
he did not speak about us , but rather than the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started in the city to change .
who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I was able to feel like the situation in the republic is getting worse .
OC Media : what action do you go right now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much appreciated in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I commun@@ ed with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meeting , I join them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I have no p@@ enny for this .
I discovered these people myself as I wi@@ pe off the curse .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ al@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
thus , nature , that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to draw you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no gay with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ iner , which are the Russians also , on the entire planet it is - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant to hear something .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fa@@ des in Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
do you know , many think about transi@@ tive identity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a kind of action .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact , different habitats .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad about it - I simply know I am myself .
local groups war@@ n an increase of self @-@ mor@@ ants within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a strong increase of self @-@ mor@@ ants for the last months .
the photograph of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i was the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z , in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he sow@@ ed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , who can reach the in@@ ability to his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Human Rights , who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
one of YouTube videos shared the moments after he had lit himself , firmly .
some people make it fast to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ eg@@ . hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the internal combustion were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists on site warned that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - starts up .
their stories have a thing in common : there were all family fathers , who felt themselves because of persecution on the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , located in which vast majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community is located , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny their livel@@ ih@@ oods .
a century ago , Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy across Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources the regional economy is still growing slowly , and the local population will only get little of that wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ duction .
the Iranian regime denied the gene@@ alogy of Ah@@ w@@ azi &apos;s systematically work@@ places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of tribes , the waters of the Arabic areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and Gh@@ om are surrounded .
these ro@@ ofs have only led to destroying the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm @-@ trees industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ci@@ zi @-@ adolescents rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ atives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , completed primary school , 55 % of a secondary school ended and 45 % have completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral human rights activist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to an &quot; high rise &quot; of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become more recently worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since functional and institutions does not prefer Arab labour force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi will have access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside of their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi , because even Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because speaking Arabian language or wearing Arabian clothes .
given the given circumstances caused by the Arab Republic of Ah@@ v@@ azi , human rights activists propose an alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to wait , if the world is w@@ aking up and knowledge .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why don &apos;t I identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the object of several discussions where many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
if I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who describe themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even took scientific and social arguments from me , why I should be a feminist , and why we generally must be all femin@@ inity * inside .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education as men .
that women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women have sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender are still across across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and known .
I &apos;m convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to skin color , rac@@ ism , on black C@@ is women , on black male women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or to black women , as well as I mention , what kind of feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists decided to dis@@ close many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but they all agree that women - all women should come together to lift &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &apos; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence gives an institutional form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we have black women exposed to two times .
or above that black women and women of other eth@@ n@@ ics and origin of origin earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with mig@@ rant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all men , neither skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman likes to take into account the un@@ righte@@ ous@@ nesses in their thinking , which relate to both the gender and skin color of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminine sphere who always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ der@@ ner accused 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to justify an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program .
I will not attempt to opp@@ ose white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to increase it .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women in different approaches and borders with white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself full of femin@@ ism and join me of femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ feminist para@@ dig@@ m that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and give us into the spher@@ es that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately called Separatism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contra@@ dictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither exagger@@ ated , nor ignored , nor rejected .
Pad@@ del@@ ing against the pollution : the mission of a man , the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of an content @-@ sharing agreement , this article is again published here .
Nabil Mus@@ a travelled again in the past 7 years - mostly with a surf board or in a can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution of its community .
&quot; I necessarily wanted to do something for the river we had lost as I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from around the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dust , pollution and un@@ controlled development , to be led to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Alliance - which is involved and working in protecting &quot; the rivers , streams , and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced and edited by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq @-@ based documentary fil@@ mer@@ in and multimedia journalist , filmed and published .
the focus of their work is on the following , little substantial sub@@ cultures and is characterized by using co@@ oper@@ atively video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help to tell their stories their way .

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ p@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ef@@ ree ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect people affected .
a police officer said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become violent against violent .
since the end of their relationship had been passed and the police said , their testimony would be put to the files , but they could not do any more .
as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena demonstrated because of abuse , the opening ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez made nothing .
a few days later , the second wife moved their display .
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women keep viewing at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financi@@ ally dependent upon men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to have victims of violence in the law en@@ forcement agencies .
In@@ accounting 1 Wei@@ ghing and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ seen Mis@@ sions and a Right @-@ System that is not inferior to 3 s@@ wis@@ s laws : good approach , lacking implementation beats and st@@ ats
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a research scientist at Centro de Document@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are several data and reports that are not even ans@@ at@@ ise the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General Prosecutor dropped 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went violence against women .
86 % of ads came from the police .
there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in peace violence . 86 % of the ads came from women .
in ads , 40 % of women were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics show however not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a own criminal , the prosecution authorities cannot be appropri@@ ately documented , how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners .
at least 12 cases of women killed in the country alone until August 2016 .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days died a woman due to violence against men .

invisible ab@@ uses and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ take anything
before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then he would have regre@@ t@@ ted it for ever .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and no longer served with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence against women , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zable :
I have never thought that I would be victim of abuse .
when I read in the past , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos myself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit his behaviour was a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had liked it so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost like that , as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner they l@@ acked them .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk with others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Vict@@ ori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without a result and also from its relatives , they won &apos;t receive support .
it led a trial against its former partner who developed into an un@@ predic@@ table legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country in which it was primarily about money , power , and influence of their former partner .
corrupt laws : good approach , lacking implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad@@ vert of ab@@ uses is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , sees considerable problems with the use of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # Princ@@ ely ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law is to explain the fem@@ ici@@ dal to an independent criminal continu@@ ance and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to win the Socialists and Democrats , who feared the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had expected to cost most of the ( bureaucra@@ tic and economic ) process , which must carry out the victim of violence themselves , if they just want to deposit and receive a secure accommodation , to imp@@ ose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the law@@ makers don &apos;t have sufficient financial resources to provide :
in Paraguay , abuse are seen as part of human relationships .
here , there must be re@@ thinking that violence is no longer regarded as a little Nor@@ te .
who , in view of these facts , are inde@@ b@@ ted , and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators .
we have to refund so long , until ab@@ at@@ ment does not apply as normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been modified . among other things a passage was kn@@ itted , which initiated the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconc@@ ile .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the passage regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his victims .
however , the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continue to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked to the website of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n on the homepage of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed an independent Arabic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri were also arrested and placed on the court , but later was free .
Oman is ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said , who came to power since 1970 , after he had depos@@ ed his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces , Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Court for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the observ@@ atory efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic affairs , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including freedom of freedom , ob@@ servers and human rights def@@ endants , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and imprisoned .
the authorities enter@@ tain peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and informed citizens , also activists , and their views on public matters of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisoned three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 over corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of A@@ zo@@ am@@ n , published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to his hands of Justice &quot; on July 26 , 2016 . it was about corruption in the Judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of lifting the Supreme Court of Justice in Oman under pressure to raise a judgment in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bound hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Ab@@ ri was arrested and detained by the ISS in front of the Special Department , and was arrested by the Security Council on his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who according to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is , was acting as Chief Editor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed on in@@ definite period after the information Minister had given the directive that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , prohibited from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ab@@ ri took place in M@@ ask@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ standing of the State of State . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , one year@@ ling ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Ab@@ ri was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) , after making use of an information network to dis@@ sem@@ ination material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Ab@@ ri , a b@@ ail was set at the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ al Court acquitted Al @-@ Ab@@ ri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , and Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for six months .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the prison sentence of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in M@@ ask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Information Council , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper sees itself exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Information Minister issued a directive that the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further directive in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months , bringing the Minister for another time against the decision of the Appe@@ al Court to return the publication of the newspaper .
the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman recently the press freedom was injured .
for further injuries , for example , closure of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to set up their operation .
because of the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to :
1. You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ conditional release ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press freedom in the country and
4 . under all circumstances that human rights and journalists in Oman reli@@ eved their right human rights work and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including geri@@ atric c@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non@@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and adjacent States to gather peac@@ efully , supported and providing peace to them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture is done with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
for the need of medical research , there are two reasons : for one of the offer of global healthcare industry many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical demand on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists himself will be solely promoting research and technology capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the study of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored on the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions about this research .
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is based on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ish national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also launch a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens .
g@@ v : what are your opinion about most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we just implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain receiver , rather than to be mo@@ vers .
the solutions we get is often not well used in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
g@@ v : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries .
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students in all age classes .
there are need for special scientific training starting in every age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transferable and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them .
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : there are often limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines are accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on bred a salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only forced through his own exp@@ atri@@ ation and the question of how many salmon varieties can get boundaries .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s it noted that more salads were patented and that he could not allow them to re@@ produce them .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or m@@ apped leaves .
over the last few years , more of these patents have been registered on more plants such as grain or cart@@ ot@@ t@@ ens@@ or . because of this trends , plant @-@ makers , environmental prot@@ ectors and experts ensure food security in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of thousands of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on is still making a salad , but he needs longer a longer time since his work is still becoming more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like that in a river a rock is lying around which I must be p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents will go on salads too far .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed any more new salads , because all features are already patented . &quot; it makes as good as possible and tries to breed the features that he wants .
however , it is very cau@@ tious and stri@@ ving to use no material which is protected as intellectual property .
it has also been connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere on the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Roman sal@@ at from the variety out@@ red@@ ress in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; greenhouse . &quot; there is being tested , whether plants can be cultivated in space .

it is no coincidence that this name might sound like this , as it would come from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called in order to ensure that some plant species and organizations are not protected as intellectual property , and for plant breeding are permanent .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eder can agree that others can freely use the seed without them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eder can only allow others to breed their seeds , to breed so own varieties , and not immediately exp@@ elled - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of bre@@ e@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ zed professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants and environmental protection as well as for environmental protection .
seeds plays a role in major mer@@ ging such as biodiversity , rights of peasants , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eder would attempt to use the latter not or only little to use seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the open @-@ source movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants may be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; if you want to buy our goal of ecological sustainability in the global agricultural industry , it is also important to know how it is grown to farmers markets , such as such vegetables is far@@ med , threatened by themselves .
nutrition sovereign , without seed sovereign , is not possible . &quot;
members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative under@@ take to provide others their seed remains free to provide . so , in contrast , seed and plant features are to be patented .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i support argued that the future of food supply is endangered because of the usual gene pool , due to becoming more abundant spiritual property rights to plant material , which consequently be limited , shr@@ inking as always .
Claire Lu@@ by , Office of the O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation at carrots and their availability . she found out that roughly one @-@ third of all cart@@ el attributes are protected as intellectual property , which is either non @-@ usable for plant breeding .
for other plants there are no estimates not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggests that mass @-@ con@@ served plants like wheat in even larger scale are patented as salad or carrots .
a Question of Vis@@ ions
plants are grown so far@@ med that they have targeted features - of such as their taste or colour improves up to such due to those in certain environments , and with@@ stand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder has more than ever more patents than ever before , as the changed conditions are much worse than ever before , because the change conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto &apos;s spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monopol@@ y activities . with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States , the company set up the conservation of genetic diversity .
however , this is contra@@ dic@@ tory that the intellectual property comprises other bre@@ e@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the Protection of Plant Vari@@ ant Innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has expired .
often these instructions help others to come with another approach to the same result .
such protection does not prevent innovation , but promotes it , providing more material and know @-@ how to be provided . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years of waiting , until a patent loop , certainly doesn &apos;t generate innovations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general well and remain : &quot; independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incen@@ tives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers their job .
this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we are not creating the features .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ e@@ ders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who are breeding a variety , also breeds its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures must be needed for cultivation of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is genetically modified . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are ) patents make it the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patented , or they keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeding Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mort@@ on is also convinced that bre@@ eder is characterized by avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ rons &apos; innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than businesses that are patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors can sell my own varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years ago , it is very easy to make it easy . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance
although the US seems to be a leader in the open source of breeding , the concept has spread rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organization in resources , is an open source of traditional crops and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain varieties .
it also helps to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell her own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bre@@ eder in the European Union .
( rules for the bre@@ edings differ from country to land , because the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be taken over one into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants could not be patented . thus , it concerns the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents are allowed in conven@@ tionally far@@ med plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is necessary to implement this new line in the governments of the Member States .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from whole East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to dis@@ focus seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &quot; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , states that the organization is currently creating a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , scheduled for the planned next year .
a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ cent@@ ration ) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a Association adopted by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - represents the view that farmers have to have the opportunity to share and improve seed policy , thereby enabling a stable supply of food products .
in the report also the importance of a diverse , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is empha@@ sized - a connection , by the Lu@@ by by O@@ ss@@ i , hopes it will soon be recogni@@ zable by more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly noticed where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now attemp@@ ting to make people clear that even more behind their food is &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column .
on the weekend of the 05.@@ August the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and report on sel@@ fish@@ ness .
in August , the network released a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step sharply , promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Sheet - despite this attack and the di@@ stortion of the Egyptian law and to defend a vote in this part of the world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the lock and do not add . we insi@@ sts on to fulfil our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language version of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web links to sacrifice . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I there is also no access to Egypt &apos;s blog and human rights studies Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles that he will not write their accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to b@@ ypass the Egyptian government &apos;s Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video like the police force physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly turn around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him :
however , to lock blogs is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be important for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It is able to communicate a sense of siege to me ; an arrest , an attempted murder , an attempt at the National Security Council , the blocking blogs , and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I did not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have an impact if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the posts of articles to circum@@ vent c@@ ens@@ orship .
however , after having locked him and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities opened up on 24 May to 06 August , 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers by converting Internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12th we realized how to offer the blocking of websites , which V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practices indicate the intention of blocking the government to block contents and filters , which could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation , in addition , is caused by the fact that the most exposed doors are hit behind closed doors , due to which the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by which they can proceed with court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
fighting the inhabitants .

day for Day reports newspapers in Brazil , with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country , and home of numerous postcard designs .
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Each day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves screw@@ ed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a united financial situation , the threat from 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
so , released for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; war in Rio . &quot;
all reports about violence in the city will now be published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city in the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual ass@@ aul@@ ts , etc . everything that happens to the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , stated that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist in the newspaper declares that there are 8@@ 43 territories listed according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to tu@@ alize the atro@@ cities of the police , which raises and then asks questions to tu@@ alize .
but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners .
is the term &quot; war &quot; more than it is profitable ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Brasi@@ l , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued to describe the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is the opinion of a jus@@ tification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to account responsible for the police .
this is no war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning , as shown in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with un@@ sufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of the public service .
to remember : the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong , according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the toll rates per federal state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media business of South America , that empha@@ sized how C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia has been stressed the security policy of the State since years .
in addition to these safety policy measures , the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit formed by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was aimed at conquer a Fav@@ ela police unit due to the use of a massive police bill .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of non@@ violent deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP , however , after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , was increasingly under s@@ uss .
on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Charle@@ aux from an article published in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio will also cause serious consequences for people .
for this calls for the state to use , means and approaches , which are typical for a war . this is the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and an object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ damage &quot; and &quot; dist@@ orted spher@@ es . &quot;
war , or ago , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio will continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police en@@ clave the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ in@@ ho , to kill the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made headlines : an or@@ chard died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians , plant mushrooms
screenshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organisation , PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently present some one million Syrians in a state of the siege .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 resulted in the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of the UN and other human rights organisations that the massacre was carried out by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels under siege , stood outside of Damascus , leading that the inhabitants placed on local or dra@@ fted by tun@@ nels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade traditional food products such as meat has become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ near and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i does not belong to conventional food , in Syria , they are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , her food is an attractive source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Head of the project , subscription Nabil , spoke to the French news agency AFP :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that have been fighting for the past three years , and expressed his relief for more than three years , making it more and more . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ near as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to provide 125 family knowledge to grow fung@@ i , so Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is directed to generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity is 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the fuel short@@ ages , plastic materials are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. L@@ eila said global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; production of the fungus &quot; from the regions , before they checked their quality and , whether they are suitable for consumption .
afterwards they planted a small pil@@ chard in a bowl . as this , they used a larger bowl . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; teaching yard for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after 3 months , they have spread mushrooms throughout East G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. L@@ eila stated that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to contribute to the people of the fungus for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : the siege of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee , box , etc ) to be used for the extraction of new food .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
to create new work@@ places for people with disabilities , who are bound to their home .

Portuguese request justice for the victims of the 2017 victims
several hundred people prot@@ ested in Portugal on 21 October in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that ra@@ ged in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government of solidarity with the victims of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , the forest areas are monitored by satellite photos , only 500,000 hectares of forest are inc@@ iner@@ ated in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .
a whole of Portugal is burning in the sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to en@@ com@@ fy the extent of tragedy so far as possible .
João So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão were streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
they nowhere did this Sunday : there are dozens of reports from open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy happened in June , as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits rec@@ alls at high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the roller form , which had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was objec@@ tion@@ ed by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstac@@ le to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the structural role of funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; João sorting in the same article in the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it carefully , that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , turned out as in a v@@ icious circle , according to the fires of this kind .
these problems will be added that the site of the civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents sought information or tried to contact person , offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : she used the individual &apos;s own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time via the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the fire brig@@ ade and this fat@@ eful weekend in October so crucial that the server had pursued the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires , the website counted more than half a million requests .

the Path from Refu@@ ge@@ es from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began the Taliban .
two years ago a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair .
just at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together .
even if his mother was not so said , she knew she would never see her son a lot more - maybe even more .
the boy starts to break up in the morning .
his uncle would pick him up , and bring him to the locks .

Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , who dominated the leader of Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban and became un@@ protected by Haz@@ ara .
the Taliban is getting closer to their hatred for Haz@@ ara known .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
after a few days after his escape A@@ shar@@ af found herself back in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ar who were heavier than he himself to make his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was min@@ ted by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , where we worked also .
there was no services there and no heating . we hanging n@@ ylon before the open windows , so that we do not indul@@ ge in the night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe .
when the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was A@@ shar@@ k homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church , which was divided twice a day meal at needy people .
it is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for commercial asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that seek asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disast@@ rous .
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centers . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ processed staff . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers may only be allocated for asylum if they officially filed an application for asylum - which , after the registration of asylum seek@@ ers can still go for months .
until then there are people who have no money for accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ familiar lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ k to break out of these conditions soon .
after having made various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ af stir@@ red his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a mu@@ ggy piece .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now on the theme of the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution on the way to other European countries .
during the last years some of Afghanistan company operated companies , among them tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant talks about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepreneurs Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna , and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s destinations are far beyond the Italian restaurants industry and retail markets , and target back to the country , which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of society and must get the same possibilities like all the others . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end there stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af did this journey itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft bill , which fore@@ sees that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority .
users would have to use to take advantage of social networks within six months after the use of the authority on the authority of the authority , as well as their ID number .
those who lost this step might be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the appeal of a criminal payment .
the law , recruited by sixty members of Parliament , is currently present as legislative as well as the Parliament &apos;s Constitutional Committee and should be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of parliament filed a legislative proposal , in which harder pen@@ alties would be introduced for the achievement of President or a high officials .
Egyptian law is already fir@@ med by Egyptian law , as well as government agencies . under the draft recommendation would be a such act , however , with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted .
in addition , this would be a political climate , in which the right to free expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , arrested by Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military put@@ sch , who led to the administration of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in jail for a court date .
recently , his sentence was post@@ pon@@ ed on 20 May because the prison supervision according to human rights groups were failed to bring the accused by the prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ critical burden from among other arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary free . they were charged for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ F@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , aged 25 years to 5 years .

in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ g@@ ation of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mostly promised to an end of action plan drawn by the President of the Republic , who would explicitly grant a controversial bill of law , according to the plan , and during the former regime by dictator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption of the official am@@ nesty laws .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at introduces a light on how the character@@ izing plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia is the nam@@ ing of his sources under the declaration of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press co@@ de@@ xes that journalists sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
will China force social media to reference their identity card ?
according to new rules on the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need approval in China before they write messages in social media .
in addition , the provisions will also be specified , that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that it should be reached by the elimination of anonymous commentary in the social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have suggested in the social media , these provisions have only selective through to protect citizens &apos; journ@@ alism and independence .

according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed , We@@ Chat , to register with the state government as the &quot; organizer of the Information distribution . &quot;
this name is part of a law in 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government will organize a list of online services , which allows the &quot; release of information . &quot; the law also allows to make services responsible for removing contents and force them on request to termin@@ ate user data .
