<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, American authors have read and run his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had become a very profound impact on me that I was a journalist, mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-magistrate, who wanted to occupy his interest, which he wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was it, as if that's the absolute truth, all others, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, had my admiration for the USA only reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of conspinned people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of its ascent is for me as he moves with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says what he thinks he was his former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro American and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his testimony and voted in flocks for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support these bigotte person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not put Trump and his voters to be in line with people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my Professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, receives people from around the world, a deeply believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, Trumps has not voted to persuade the "Cincinnati Inquirer" by Peter Bhatia, the present publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at stake.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity which I had struggled with Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life long and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to accustom us to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, there were Andrew vitey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser advice has helped me much in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people, they embodied by they embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump bump his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a halt, and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 there were over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of its contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they were either distributed to racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, almost broke the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump-voters as raassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">The people accept, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who are acting to another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters have voted for Trump, because they don't want control over a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they wanted to say that they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to find a man who looks down with contempt upon those who looks different.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.): as much as "The rebellion of the White against all other ethnicities"; word play made of white in touch to the White and Whiplash (which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones, has exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may always have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">Because this country chose to be the president, twice the son of a Kenianers, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise to say: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all of this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier, who is fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" said Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud sound "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">Would Muslims have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and silent "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for whom his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero congregation in Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played at both places is not only the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill colony, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the municipality: one of children and adults existing music orchestras, which has found a possibility of overcoming the surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for their drugs abuse and the gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this was changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hopeliness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always get laughing and with shining eyes and play in the action you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timke, Bongos and the Conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero the children of Cateura - a village located in the top of the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital's capital - on instruments which are made of reprocessed waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recovered instruments, made of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where recycling under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez has begun to turn parts of the waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violin, viola, celli, contrabass guitars, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician teacher, remembers the children of Cateura:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin brought out of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and call The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who are with him and of him are the troubles - like men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational song from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra performed his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successfully fighting illegal fishing</seg>

<seg id="98">This entry, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication is in the context of an agreement with Global Voices on the common use of contents.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before starting the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were brought accordingly to them and is little inclined to welcome a lawyer of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorcs, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to give him a harbours and refused to give him a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"suddenly the Premier was encircled by countries that you have just refused," says Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishery authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship of his time and persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars on Liberia, because of pillaging fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative which protects the criminal practices and protect resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries in 2012 by the NRO stop illegally stop fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network have the six countries that the Premier were expelled from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are conspinned and work together. you exchange information and get each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured, is hidden because it is extremely difficult to use. thus, illegal fishing is a main cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the intentional contempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are protected, illegal fishing ecosystems may harm a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing were impregnated by bureaucratic hurdles, and through the worm stamp, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen now in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There you can exchange individual countries, such as lists existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you notice or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive if they move on the open sea, via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This enables the authorities to mark the ships that are fishing in banned areas - such as those who suggest that a ship listens to his caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can indicate whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly, whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, can be refunded on the basis of such information that the ships can't sell their cargo. and that they may not be forced to pay their charge, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Senior Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already known platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost turnover, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate the waters in East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as the sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying imaginary names, fishing-protected species and fish in wildlife areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "you can use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-defined control system" "", "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could then say 'you mustn't run my harbor." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legal slip hole try to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 years of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks, which had been distributed licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been followed and found refuge.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to attract suspicious ships precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that is constantly evolving, helps prevent illegal ships who like to hide yourself.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO, which also deals with fisheries-data and support FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be subscribed by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system which combines different levels of information. it is supposed to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with larger precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's Team African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch with Google and the Marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and the position of each individual trailable ship can be displayed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours, to get a better picture of it, who's what you do - that's just meaning," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and join her resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel detective, but they also deter them away.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were used previously without license fisher and hardly had any consequences with consequences, you know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i countries participated in a 33% increase in fisheries, since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board trawl nets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that we now have to copy other countries," says Kiilu. "we are a study subject." in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will vanish by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015 there are six countries closed to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "security is the aim to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country was reported on its first big triumph in October: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship used under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and have been banned wow nets which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also enclosed in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "the take of measures against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world.

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced from his father to view the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now, as an adult man, Quixano now said in the part of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were examined during the Argentine military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quixano hasn't visited his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden, the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed in the age of 15 years he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained his family secrecy for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then, I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">I was not able to know that my father was a thief, folky and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quixano was Gendarerieofficials. during the Argentine military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was a deputy of the secret service department 141 in the La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made combat sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionaries of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he charged me to go back to the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me, I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my father had taken me up.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: archives, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda stamps, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">'It is over, the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla, everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small wrapped in a blanket, and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw it was a great clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other hand of the barracks, where the stolen objects were removed, and refrained me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed out an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in, and saw a song that were tortured on men.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened the end of a cable. the other end was fastened at the body of the person who had just tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They captivated a man with handcuffs on the bed, overthrew him with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts to the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The contention there was there was horribly... like a dirty wine.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: what is it possible for a man to do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">"I knew that these people were killed."</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wore eyes.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was also charged in the trial) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses, on which naked people were attached to the face down - everyone was tied to hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the proximity of the enchanted people still on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">When my father saw that I saw the prisoners, he said, "What do you look at that, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "I replied," "" "Why did you get me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit, and killed by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this, because my father spoke at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Beside La Cuadra were some rooms known as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero struck a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to data from survivors of the civilian, Jorge Romero, who was also accused of being indicted in the La Perla Ribera trial, the student RaÃºl Mateo Molina to death).</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The road that you came in here is also the way, on which the kidnapping came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of declassifying a number.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement came from above that they should be moved.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time, I had no idea what the "war of war" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was at the military myself, I was in the gendarmerie - it was clear to me that war rails are a bayonet or perhaps military rabbit, which one gets lost to an enemy which is fought.</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quixano with his son.</seg>
<seg id="272">Archival Recording</seg>
<seg id="273">But if you go into a house and the fridge, the turntables, clothes, paintings, money... miss, then no war yield but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, the head of security forces to participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't get it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer in the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminal and I answered: and you who stipulate the cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded anger, and struck me, and cried, saying,</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and embracing you.</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need any others!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the process I showed a photo of that, on which I wore a jacket and a wheel pullover of wool. I had my father out from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being conspying with this crime. I said, no problem, they can lay a burden to me what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway, I was there to tell.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last abheinous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I feel remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if one has only children, one recognizes the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and recognises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you were exiled during the dictatorship, but why should the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why do children deduce?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day, my father brought a girl with her home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always stood the question again: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could not have been put in prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but what their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Were these people not also families, whom one could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the body is the last abhous act, which one can do a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was introduced again, they fetched machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were trodden down and there is no idea, no idea, where. "you never find something," said my father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains naturally always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'i've seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clear it: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even was with the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea, to display my father, arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I made his accusation because of all the atrocities I had to live for him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"" "then he suddenly said," "" "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="314">I felt inwardly, and asked me, why the whole-time Patriotism and the "Western and Christian feelings" which they allegedly defended themselves.</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something?</seg>
<seg id="317">"" "I have seen how you killed people!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed horrific crimes and you have compelled me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He only said "Well then to me."</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I accepted the first display.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">Nobody can submit to me that I am not cleansed. I have finally said against my own father.</seg>
<seg id="324">Luis Alberto Quixano died in May 2015 under house arrest, standing before the end of the trial.</seg>

<seg id="349">The false translation was published in the entrance area and the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Machining the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a inhabitants of Kyotos. he was also who made the local loids to him.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun in Kyoto was written:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult for older people and in an international city just as Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The correct translation of English translation was initially removed. the name of "Justice" (German: "terrible motorists") was later replaced by the more appropriate, although grammatically failed to be the correct name of "Elder." (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation of the Kyoto Prefecture. furthermore, it explained that the mistake had already been included in the text that they had received from translators, and that the translation was not checked on their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows the apologies:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sorry that older people felt through inadequate correction (the translation) on our side," said the police.</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an unreasonable description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents are, however, certainly to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture for example, in 2005 1.941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents by senior citizens. this equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, Seniors 1.803 caused a total of 11,850 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="364">The share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents decreased overall, the proportion of seniors caused accidents during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The reputable critic in the article published in the article published by the article comments on the light that show the prejudices of some Japanese seemingly against older drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translators are diverse.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active mastery of the target language - something that is in the case of native language. generally, the belief that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - mother language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate by the English to French - not from the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese firms are unable to deal with English as a mother tongue, who could translate translations into English. this may seem to be lacking understanding of the excess, cost-quality, or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who have no foreign employees, let translations exist yet firmer. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge as the best are estimated to become a translator, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The veritable and enigmatic sets that are created by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace a human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulation in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, often used T-shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not even read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors like jewelry is still acceptable, or at least harmless. but of major companies or by the government that means the funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city uses a serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protest and interest measures on the Internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">Friday morning, April 7, notified Venezuelan Internet users that they have no access to the online transmitter Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that Internet access appearances are not accessible by VPITV and El Capitolio TV.</seg>
<seg id="394">Also other online broadcasts took recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by oppositions groups that resist the government NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive, and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection is glued, and recommended the users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites Venezuelan provider is locked once again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Since 2014, traditional media reports on protests regarding protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission appealed to them with fines and closing arguments when they continue to report on demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "Call for Violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I registered me at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIN's local NGO also confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by a blocking of the domain name System (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also affects the website, where the National Assembly transfers their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">The research group of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, showed that the local Internet service providers could use DNA. thereby, it is a technology that answer the DNS server requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNA, the server responds wrong or denied the request when calling for such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm the DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third Banned channel, was hired on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who crossed the protests in Caracas live live.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was smitten, while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government was informed that the government is regulated via Internet connections: the Venezolans will always be able to provide access to multimedial reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report by the turally who published by Global Voices with kind permission of authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series titled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), processed by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not working together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her studies at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride in her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said, she said," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she started working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas to work in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is very simple: a big family with little money over her minderyear old son or her underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to afford a countless days of housework that will never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can not be raised in the context of a contract.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo, is widely used in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing his studies, Alvarenga worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimony, and denounced and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things in the name, as the feeling of gratitude, which is vaccinated the cristtas, guaranteed in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," says Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is one of the family who have their daughter in faith that they will improve their training, improve their position in society and arise "something from themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes up the girl and justifies its exploitation by faith that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise get an apprenticeship, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">If the girl is mistreated, his family will experience many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experienced it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the unseen in paraguing households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to the hospital in CaaguazÃº, their bodies showed traces of heavy strokes. shortly after that, she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military-members TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as official at the residents.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived in her house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira was killed, as long as with a stick to MarÃ­n, until they suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They insisted that the murdered child was a cristta.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted in the paraguayan society for the death of the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They signed the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozens of people came to protest appearances and demanded that there would be no other Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photographs were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to harm the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbour's neighbours and almost 60 civil society organisations required a generous examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case come from court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n will be landmark - if for the first time in history, the case of Criadazgo is a case.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik where her father worked, bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the work and started to sell money on the street or on the market, to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent to the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that you still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">It stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, clean the fridge, cleaning the living room, polished the furniture and infected the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians, ordered a bill of bill, voted "Regulations regarding the use of the use and user social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "if he is accepted by parliament, users must register social media in Egypt with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Based on the law, then a place would be established, which is assigned to share social media, citizens and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with acceptance of the law, user names would have to be registered on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do this, it may take a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt independent, defines social media as "every wede application, which is running over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when there is no indication of the design, as Egyptian authorities are supposed to be on the user's user experience, that the Egyptian government is currently unable to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is unable to guarantee the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliament of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered user names and users received a user name and a password to come by the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those who would be necessary for Egyptians for Egyptians, to obtain information on their identity, to access the network.</seg>

<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technics (in German "Senior Research Strategy") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights,") told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly of the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have technology to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that same as they could control physical public and private spaces - it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take it seriously, then it means that they are working a strong monitoring system to request a citizen or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the legislature of the Parliament and the Constitutional Council before it enters the debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the draft, "is in line with a pro-military reasoning in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that there is no deviating narration on the image surface," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are found due to Wilderei, loss and fragmentation of their habitat as they always find less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the growth of ecosystem depends on the fact that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild, is low and goes towards zero. as the team is fixed in the video that they have a recording of a large cat in the camera, Raza breaks in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made for the northeastern Japan, were forced to rebuild the lives of those who had been affected by the "threefold disaster" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a etcate prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience the earthquake and resulted from the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had to disappear whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition to that, Fukushima prefecture had an accident with an accident, already in that alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows a local perspective which advances to six years later to rebuild the life of the local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as a survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The residential construction industry in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (percepts, margatai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi's biggest success in the three prefectures were completed, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such buildings, whereas Fukushima, with 70 percent, is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Furthermore, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behelfswald (egrowers, driacsu juutaku) is still trying to resettle in final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in home shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, more than 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima, and Iwate lived in such an Behasions.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in the year 2011. more than 75 percent of evacuation, which were hauled after the disaster in Behelfslls, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and daily life in the three affected Prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 out of 1100 schools, who were affected by misfortune, opened their gates by December 2016, which makes nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures can be far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation again, in Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishing ports have re-included.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident occurred in the three prefectures of agricultural land large areas.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and could be used by less than 50 percent of the land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima, are in the "nuclear zone" zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered far again, but here Fukushima still remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent higher at the same level as before misfortune. Fukushima, however, can feature only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the catastrophe is almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall image, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacuation by. they questioned about the status of reconstruction and also, as their empire has changed towards the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction of this article, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper declares:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted an interrogation to bring more about the tsunami-consciousness under the native population experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the local population have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disasters disease has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">What about those who were evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic accident, the Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 thousand people from Fukushima have been relocated almost 63 thousand people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, have been converted into permanent houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 state of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation, which are still in Behelfssk, are older than 50 years old. you should compete in right Behind the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima, with massive construction projects. this is about building projects that are part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo that will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="625">The fords of forgotten villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso close hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Popular church in Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as a Central - based on Spanish sugar mill - regardless of that there is no notable sugar harvest on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane.</seg>
<seg id="629">After passing the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost and after its installations, only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others signed and commutes to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier-envy who rises every day at 4: 00 AM, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not smoke his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugarcane factories in the east of the region of sugar, which are after a long inactive period, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers exactly that in MaÃ±alich would have received the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugarcane industry resists the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, of Ineffefficiency, the poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar pipe industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugarcane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">Initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories, which can produce sugar for the most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugarcane plantations and the rising crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavans per pound, according to the 2016 report published by the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and food organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">When the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate roughly 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well.</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's Day will go to history with certainty," "" "These were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">Since then, the process of restructure began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the stagnation of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez worked in the factory for 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as a soldier, is known about the closure of the factory, is the word that he repeats the most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to get the place, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first leap year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was official documents related to the documents that would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulales Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any arrest.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters were increasingly frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-set factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the beet factories," he assures us.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waiting for the retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in holding his will at the holding of the factory, where construction he helped, was involved.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important job producers was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the workplaces and services, which have generated plants in the communities in which they were located.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know whether during the Mammut-speech of 21 October 2002, the then President in the eyes of the present people saw when he guaranteed that there were no longer in operation for the areas whose factories had been running well for five years.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years, the Volkscongregation Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich learned that many things change, but not always better if a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugarcane factory ended, or better, when they began to shut it off, they also listened to the road to paved the road, also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to catch other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without a future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area, a food factory was created, whose production serves not even for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>
<seg id="682">Neunundforty raised the old soldiers a pension from two thousand Peso a month to spend the years retiring in MaÃ±alich.</seg>
<seg id="683">Mr. Nene, a man of black skin color, small, with a few teeth and clearer voice, is no subsequent person, nevertheless he gives the lies that one told him not.</seg>
<seg id="684">They have torment him for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="685">Nene walks in rents for 65 years, not because it is lacking in force, but because he is bittered.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations Communities in all of Canada employ themselves with topics that are important to them. they do with hip-hop, thanks to a number of touring workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan Tour, mobile audio studios have been bringing directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec and ten Cree-communities and then working with the Cree Hip-Hop group The Northstars together.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is increasing with the young participants in our conversations, such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptable" or whatever it comes into the sense.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the leading actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">For example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo, in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, called the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were generally not explained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of influences.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters don't always master the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation recorded, the chorus will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people participating here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who lieve them a stronghs in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookside of N'we Jinan the Strophe is available in transcript, as a translation into English, translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel, nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to go on Earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will take to our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as youth.</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So you can grow and go forward in our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">Thus, they can do that, for what they intended for creators</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can watch plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are located close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (percepts to the interiors of the dishes ") from every food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are viewing this plastic dishes, then decide whether they entered the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Kappabashi district of the Kappabashi District, there are a variety of these small companies that manufacture the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usually that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning it today in showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new with plastic-coated cell straps, as they are shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificially different foods have been turned to kitten collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the Essentifications is increasingly elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a Imperial-don (a popular bowl with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For these triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also produced this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple, which is holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile support and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there someone who would say: "Wow, cool, now I can betray my mobile phone with salmon?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appetizing form, to surprise your colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melon ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and a molybdenum of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More skurrile plastic dishes can be found under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag # 1 drop of the business.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, then gives you this video an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. like for example with shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the infamous "fight against drug dealers" in Mexico, the mischievous and killed regularly appear in statistics. however, this reflects the extent of the human tragedy that struggle with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of Sinaloa, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict entirely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the sadness or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each body, behind every bone is buried in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, their wounds may never cure.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal animal polÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug retailers live"), which is said to give this victims a voice and stories of people who were in the struggle between prosecuting authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime leaves us not only to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The implications are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if business are close, because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole churches need to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear of life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father, who takes secret graves any weekend after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, which only lost their father, four siblings, her husband and two of her nephew.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "Priest:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves to the task that we have asked to go, go to the tombs, after the people we loved to seek." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in a shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again. "Emma Veleta:" it's very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need a training.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is also here with me.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, they have no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she does not pay off, because that demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get this?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only have the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and the State.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been able to know illness and sensation of journalism since a few years.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures that actually can only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the panel.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only ones that disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body once.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin thinks he will become Narco (German: drug dealers) if it's great. and it's also not normal that people will hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they mocks those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of mankind is incredible for me if death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in one neighboring village was justified to be justified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to agree that they are spared from such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months Erpressung in the Main stadtDistrict: like a family with threats of threats," it describes how armed criminals took money from their business until the end did not only destroy the business, but also had torn its family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes again high, when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will run or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these fearless days whether weeping would dissolve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he asks questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to rise in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to make a egg cooks, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for preparing flacon with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine narrows on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole lives of violence exists and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years ago when he just found a few blocks away from his father, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men out of a moving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was killed by organised crime and fighting with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the council of government security and government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 murders. this equates to an average of 8,5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of stories that organized the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories live in the face of always new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug dealers, which has tormented the country in the past four decades, in an understandable manner.</seg>
<seg id="816">If a picture is worth a thousand untrue words</seg>
<seg id="817">"Sharing is Caring" from Flickr user Niklas Viking (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNUNG: this post and the pages where it is linked, include pictures on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The factor check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise a rumour or fake a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years immersed for the first time? content in social media, whether it is true or untrue, tends to endure further.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it was deferred to misleading tragedies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false copy of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft news - denies not the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage about events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">It raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker trucks crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thereby devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous paths which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to the victims.</seg>
<seg id="828">The representative described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinemas near, which was full of people who illustrate the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses booted and captured corpses in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerant to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.several photos of the incident form the gruesful scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Up above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It displays rows of tightened body, which are rounded up on the ground, while persons are watching them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story is not its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photograph was taken over several times on social media, blogs, and other platforms, but did not seem to be attributed to related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram attacked the remote villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities where they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and carcases were burned in streets and building.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">The numbers could not be confirmed. "no one stayed behind to count bodies," said a population on Human Rights Watch.</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up can only be illustrated by satellite imagery.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unexplained, but the army-base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was due as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place in Paris two days.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this dismissive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abnormalities; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further, this example illustrates the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange joined the deadly tracking of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar in connection with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Rohingya.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee strokes, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from the violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following, brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidi-Arab News page, which did falsely alleged that President Myanmars Tha has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslim. in addition, she had used the picture from the DR Congo to educate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was accessed recently on April 26, 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news agencies, AFP, as their source called, had also attributed to Tha witness this statement, but did not put the picture from the DR Congo in connection.</seg>
<seg id="859">The world wide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Tracks of this wrong coupling range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using a "reverse picture search" you can see how far information could cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">A reverse picture search with the searchengine of TinEye has found 344 at 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images which are very similar to the image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mask of private sites, platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have forwarded false reports, some have tried other attempts to unmask the fake.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have been examples of misuse and used them in connection with the respective countries, on the basis of whose page they had been published. thus, we want to display the range of clearer than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the listed countries (which were linked in some cases also linked to each other), several samples can be used for misuse.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames (frame) that go through this post. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions regarding the silence of Christians by Muslims or - to the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second Framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued as a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Religion understanding and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examine how images are used in the context of these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer give this pictures longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are many people who have unintentionally inflicated the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Sugger this mood of mal- and mismisinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and is the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of nonviolent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the refusal to recognise pictures of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images even demands of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern that violent images readers and viewers destize their ability to empathy empathy (such as this study who sought to work as violent media to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are some regards to nonviolent representations in the news media, fact is fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimented with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." you'll have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests something that is actually possible, or completely abstained from the context or on completely misused way.</seg>
<seg id="940">An investigation of false concessions, however, should also take into account how internationally they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons is used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name of Untranslatable (e.g. inseparable) endeavoured to offer language enthusiastic about words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are available in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others that are rooted in a specific culture (for example, the Spanish pedal).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly to every attempt of an easy translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, why a complete explanation, and sometimes something context are required to understand what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been gathered for a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal Japanese, German, French, Portuguese, or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on little languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's VAT, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Dimensions around your parents in recognition of how to strive yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsure language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - Commitment or laziness that you feel after being washed in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds in his own words about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They disgrind other cultures, reveal other ideas and wake up our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you can analyse, analyze how we analyse the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "irreplaceable" words, and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to invite their favorite songs here.</seg>

<seg id="1026">This narrative is the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades, while the US could not even choose her first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are inhibited, their head scarf in public buildings, and Saudi Muslim, Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storyteller count, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be an option, right here and now, in spite of a language barrier with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) is the count of stories in their original language a possible answer to that.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the unmistakable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve the diversity of great cities and appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not admitted to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world may be avoided, when we create cities which must not forget the diversity - in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often is connected to understand," check these events instead "the listeners to appreciate, to feel, connect."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers set their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation are showing that the listeners can rely on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional history from Burkina Faso, which is told in language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou also takes the opportunity to explain the country's typical customs of stories.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamusara tells the beak from Hoses and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having explained the meaning of his beak, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that your language does not understand?" with a wide Grinses he shares his feeling of the Bible:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities and the organisers are hoping to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS in contact with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took up to 72 million US dollars, participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started at the Puky Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Citizens on the Neurexamination of the debt) and the Okomenian Church assembly, Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-fixing of debt also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico demanded that politicians, bankers and government authorities, who are responsible for debts, are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">We call for a financial testing and a tap committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions according to the remuneration that acts in favor of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not her.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The syrically-Palestinian webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi is known for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continued to support the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions which he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: PUBLICA, the annual conference for the digital culture, which was aligned to Berlin, dedicated a event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of France based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publisher of the book published by so-called 'Book Sprints' completed books within three to five days, lapped excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective In. (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book that has been published last year and is free here, contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss the movements of free knowledge and what the real costs are connected with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researcher and authors, who have been involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to look beyond the mist, which gives our newsfeeds and create a little sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the Adra-prisons' directory, where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">We have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel has given a high price for his participation in free culture, many of us start to think about their own fate, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The webdeveloper of open source and digital activism has been part of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "signed command from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, who referred to as Insider in the Assad government and reported it from an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and state remain unknown, however.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in providing access to the Internet and to knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the head of the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassel's cultural prototypes were looking ahead of the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the waycross of many civilisations and merge in Greek-Roman architecture with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work that the IS would put everything on it, this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripping move to the digital archaeology and preservation has created a time capsule set to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable value.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my entire life with it, of freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each one who has asked. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught others, as they use computers at least theoretically, without knowing that they actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In addition, Ghazi is the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proverst, which she wrote in prison in the years 2012 to 2015, when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She mured the lyrics to him when she visited him, and he translated them from the Arab in English.</seg>

<seg id="1230">That, in the moment, I left the worrying, in which we embrace us,</seg>
<seg id="1231">That every one of the dangers is no matter,</seg>

<seg id="1247">Bassel's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">According to the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad's regime, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) have disappeared more than 65.000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organization Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: because of corruption, he was re-dismissed director after arrest again</seg>
<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique responded to a corruption raid against which a government member returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the case of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 together with four other defendants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for contamination of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, the Council Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately requested his reinstatement to the company, what happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the General Prosecutor of the Republic, which gave the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to return to its old posts, since the company was not working in prison after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants does not provide the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short of CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle to relocate the director of the company:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Puts a setback in the fight against corruption and clear the lack of transparency and is even a setback in regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we have to know is that the company would have introduced a disciplinarian process against the contradictory.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company remained silent, however, and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, rejects this behavior as well and considered the case as "residue":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But when he is incompetent, he consented to become reintegrated into the company which he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it's obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resisting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil tell the director no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he lied him, I cannot believe that someone had rewarded somebody in such a way, which has already offended the state so massive.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks to return morality and serve the state * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has not allowed himself to operate on the state instead.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza was used to state the state as a handy man's source of money and the state itself is tired of this man, who was charged and finally condemned to a long term imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I do not know why this man was rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remember the prime minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machines not only for ever as the first independent president in memory, but as a sharp, single-minded and - next to say - prophesied Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous mutations, when he was energetic, confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of all, even the fatherland for its ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samah also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't turn from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is decriminated at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also leaning:</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network accepted its posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although more than the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "Kalar" "" ") as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely low connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra nationalists as hate crimes against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight anti-speech in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'likes to be associated with racism today, but the word itself is not automatically called Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use, censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burdens words with basic meanings that have the same character sequences such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, the chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pairs' (spider '),' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The FacebookTwitter Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words by the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on a spiritual way if they could know how to linking his back pain, making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hur is the opinion that she should reduce hate-language nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook has to be analytic before it disseminate all Posts who disseminate racism in suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead, is carefully analysing and control the mail by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (spheres).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dirty nationalists, spreading throughout the language, will receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the promotion has a powerful signal to all of them that use anti-language, the efficiency of this strategy can't hold long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that censorship is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new guideline of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and told me the liken, post and sharing of contents for 24 hours, because the post "the Facebook community did not say."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of hosts of people who have no negative intentions or that simply try to demonstrate their opinions against the hate idealists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious Fundamentalism are in the country badly.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook would have more to do before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community around advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a well-wanted goal to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words is to give even more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Moreover, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and as words like "chair" or "peas curry" have been prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they didn't tried to rectify the falcons.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefit that would make them a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic Zensorship has provided much reproach among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now do funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of Hasspronunciation to see if their posts are taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts that were not abstained: but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and look at the peas curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook has the mail removed, which contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious Fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should stimulate violence in the communities in Myanmar in addition, especially in Rakhine area where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to talk out of hate speech to his burmese pages, criticised.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply ending the word 'Kalar', it would have better running, rather to see in context than on Code of concentrated initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were already married with 15 in Trinidad and Tobago 2,8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central Office confirmed that from 1997 to 2007, more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were anxious to abolish laws on the children's toe, followed at the foot and rejoiced. no doubt they helped to take this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">An Hindu leaders, Z. B. had no concerns to say the critics of the child, they should take care of their own matters. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition promoted tensions within this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there came doubts if the opposition would agree to the bill of law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in early 2017 the bill of bill was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent that could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of bill against child-before was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate, the draft is now able to become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws have finally been changed to children.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovel Francis, who was a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary smell that has lost the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel's Jackson's opinion was, it was definitely long enough to abolishing the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hooks comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj therefore, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu-organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj had announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be adopted, and it seems to dissolve his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a disadvocate of the law, meant that it would be justified if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, the most social media users wanted to deal differently on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear satellite, if we think instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that we would need to talk about the problem, that the state, our daughters, protects them, that they may be abused for large, hard-headed men, which are against them in the advantage, would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, if it comes to a judicial court against the law or not, this law is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children's children are legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that they are prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="1390">With the mirroring of websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia-page was published on January 18, 2012, to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month the Turkey closed the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based on encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day for day is more evident, how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and journalists and fans of TV series fight against the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniquated Internet users are used to use overhaul tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times also reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been edited by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University have been selected, regular blocking of the Internet has been adopted since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most well-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the Interfaces File System), when the platform lay down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain name and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available in the current prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the messages (via the blocking of Wikipedia), we set everything to complete snapshots of Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility of reading the contents of decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users check out at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was conducted regardless of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and any live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklope.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to hosten to similar mirrorpages when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy-address, an Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One gets to another URL, which is not the original. that which one can then see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Basically the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he saw around, never satisfied. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to wear a camera to wear and try to grave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar is trying to bring Nepal on the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town just beside Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that direct your attention to Nepal wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described Facebook how this first-class situation helps to work with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world heritage. what could be better give for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I rested just at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) stopped. he had received a call from my father, that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was, and I immediately began to gnash pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar pursues a collaboration with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal as nature and wants to deepen the understanding of that wild animals are not so frightening as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know that, as he was standing up to face from face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not interfere with the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was also because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the king of the Buheks appeared. he immediately starts to see us and he stared me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepals and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Otter. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and took six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A redesigned version was once again published as part of an content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid their greatest care, the names of their husbands, or even of elderly men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women allow her to respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was sentenced from the Indian state Oila by a pseudo-court and violate from their family and the village community after having called a married relations with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not called by name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer assignments whenever possible, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health professionals and housewives, a unique club, thus became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they discuss the hostility of patriarchate and discuss.</seg>
<seg id="1478">One of the 56 clubs exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is involved in the mining of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of their videocamera at the discovery of practices, such as children's heats up to the associations of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how this club created a safe place for these women and made them simultaneously at the ambassador of the murals.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini, showed in their discussion round, was of women who don't call their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The name of their husbands, not according to pronounce, is a roman, whom they count all injustification and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes it a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as a beggar, as woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought to have thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who previously named her husband, never called on the name, wanted to try at home, as it goes.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">My husband, my husband, turned herself to me, and said, I should call him by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the baggage Rohini started her first discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" nor ever before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem at Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini bat every participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, meaning that they do not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women will never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, she was afraid of herself in the whole exercise; another decided to leave the whole, frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">In addition to the adrenaline, you have decided to have broken their husbands at home in fact, that they would actually attempt to name their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put to women in their head: his wife could not stop asking his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner prior to the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in mother was stubborn, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini said I should do." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation was given in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tries to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he would like it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not have stopped completely with that, but mean that they are now in a better position to choose it, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion lub is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip in any discussion lub.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to make sure what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the past few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang, and spoke about things that they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things, such as our identities on our husbands, never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say some things to say loud, no matter how small they can occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them is okay, but some wanted a sage-Kurta, a vast shirt with a pants, wear; they didn't know themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of his own hind, morals associated with the Saris and much more, dingggelte Rohini her own pair Curtas (upper inhibitors) into a discussion round, so the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they can create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question is, whether in the five months since its first discussion lub, Rohini confirms that things are slowly moving into rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and not any other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion lub know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the foothes of more freedom of movement or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, it is aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I also am.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if any woman is going home in the club and tell others about what we're talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29 of this year, the hashtag was suspicious of the marriages of the million (Beatles-memorial day) in the Japanese twitter trend, which many fans revoke their memories and share their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The Beatles visit in 1966 in Japan is regarded as the turnaround in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles have been in the country, but this was enough to turn the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here is quite quick to realise that they had no other choice when the Beatles have received open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka told President of the retail series Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning!! today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan. nearly 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese karaoke-bars and in the English lessons of Japanese medium schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The putsch of the Beatles survived everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today The Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I do not know whether this "Winnie the Pooh" doll John Lennon should be present or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the known places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, you are your 5 places you need to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>

<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today The Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in the year 1966 The Beatles started the first time in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! made up for a pilgrimage to London and slept through the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies use the fan base as well as for example, such as this Ramen Shop (Ramen are Japanese pasta) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!! today The Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "I'll listen to myself today" "" "Yachts" "" "and eat the Ramen noodles with Mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably made only recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in international community attention, after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer in the end stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"" "in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years" "" "imprisonment for" "" "Subversion" "" "after he was involved in the draft of Charter 08, a manifesto that tells the democratic reforms in China." ""</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">In China, Lius's case referred to as "an internal matter" and a speaker tells that he was not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China still receives orders from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to free or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of Paares in Beijing, others are completely withered.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A speaker, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell into the Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in 2010, although the Norwegian government failed to do nothing with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to redistribute the salmon crew to China, since the exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee made his hope for an unconditional release to an expression and invited Liu to obtain his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention he was not able to meet his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">Liu was represented by an empty chair during the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6, the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was prompted to free Liu and his wife immediately free of house arrest and allow him to seek medical support, where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called Lius for the release of Lius, as she hasted in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">We are expecting to see China's limitations of Mr. Lius's wife, as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are supposed to meet and receive all visits, which they wish, and able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. ambassador Terry Branstad told him that Americans would have the opportunity for treatment abroad, unless it is provided to him in his recovery. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, gave the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy was to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also his wife Ms. Liu Xia to free his house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy revealed a furious response from China to themselves, with the utterance of the Foreign Ministry that "no country has the right to enforenish and irresponsible comments on Chinese internal matters."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the couple following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel agents and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they have legally entitled to Chinese Constitution and legal system, as well as international commitments.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision to push the Chinese government to push away Liu and his wife unconditional.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">On July 3, Berlin, the German government speaker Steffen Seibert wrote that Liu's all the medical support he needed "and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 and 8th of July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing's news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns whether the vortex could overshadow Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China invited Liu to provide an adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to provide himself from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP that Lius Mrs, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always allowed the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to anyone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum talks about:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to adopt its international human rights violations, including freedom of expression, to preserve and unlocked the rights of this rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called on China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments, which he, regardless where, needed. furthermore, his wife and his family may contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news of France info reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there would be no further information if France will ultimately absorb him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Festlandin Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Liu, and to show a greater tolerance to those who demand peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The taiwanese legisers Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progress Party called China also to allow the diseased intellectual Liu to handle in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very worried about Liu, explaining that many asked him to pray for Lius Wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He spoke about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly penalised, led to a harmonious, stable, and wealthy China, which again contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally really moved and encouraged, when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, signed by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a town.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the ministers observed that many people criticise the dominance of the only political party in Singapore, because they compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It is supported that Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the minister of justice," "" "turning the logic" "" "to defend the existing Authoritarian practice of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable country, you can say that we ultimately won't be a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had a flight before the responsibilities, a must infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'ordinary countries', in view of whose, he appeared insofter undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, alike cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old lyre has emerged from the authoritative machinations, leaving the democrats, leaving logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial authorities, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions, he decloaked with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his opinion as she didn't understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our werer K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point if it was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing on the blog, he shows that it should begin to read the entire transcript of the conference, so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "said why the elections in Singapore were so unavoidable even if we are looking forward to free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He missed Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities would like to win a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said that Singapore was not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment over Shanmugam, who makes such a polemian statement as leader of an increasing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I'm talking about what the Minister of Justice has said to Singapore,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, which I expected - would I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is real and aware of what he defended.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review specifies the weaknesses of Shanmugams argument:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam have committed a mistake "or was it a freudder loudspeaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government office, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime minister invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">Once the magazine Journey of a Decade is tending to be the year, Singapore is always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">I can understand that we often hear statements such as "the defense of the country, especially" etc., but that is not quite true.</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should speak rather of the city's defence.</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation is taking place, it is regarded as courteous to show interest in his conversational partner by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In my clarification, the standard response is usually followed: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice-hockey, Nature." many Canadians are perhaps cooking in front of anger when they are kept for Americans, but does not disturb me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know it, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians spend a Canadian flag well on their backpack when they are travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everybody love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, however,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn little maple sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>

<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gay marriage in Canada has been legal since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "sorry."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada, too, is believed to be the tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like those types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends who I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't account for me if you would like to change Johnny from Dallas, for example.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">Firstly: as "nice" means to be called, as the good, gentle, gentle, gentle, but tragically, insignificant figure Ned Flanders, "The Simpsons" (who has a own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really had a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which one can meet.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, being unobtrusive and uninteresting to earn and no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to be unnoticed in the background, away from things that pass around one.</seg>
<seg id="1773">"" "" "" "I would even go to say, that the desire to be free and alone, is a master of Canadians." ""</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own matters.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders listed as "nice" is perhaps simply cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't talk about the fence with its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lacks hot hearted, open kindness, which I have now connect to my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Fortunately for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop-band has released a music video, which took the power in 2014, and reaffirmed the civilian government in 2014, and continues to govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what rules his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video refers to the continued military power of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video for song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Only within the first three days the video uploaded to Facebook 1.254 and received 8,800 reckes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin-Video "was blocked by the dictator" in Thailand after a group of activists trained to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">You can interpret the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, as special as the situation in the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these videos of the video which relate to some of the political topics, which have been harnessing in Thailand during the last three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The 44 rules of girls "possibly refer to the draconian section of 44 of the provisional constitution, which is the commander-in-chief of the header's absolute decision.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the infamous program "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are regarded as a critic by the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal law, its vague and unclear rules often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, supervised the online content and persons accused of having rejected the monarchy and prosecute the grounds of criminal responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets a strict drawing against "Lesis Majeste" (majesty of poverty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax rate.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van, before you bring them into an interventional camp, another problem may occur.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are sitting in the prison, because they allegedly caused the confusion of "confusion" in society and serve Internet users, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band that imitated the Salut, "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by coup opponents during protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">Now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchasan War was officially ended, but his scars are still very visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show distinctive images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the carbohydrate basin of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups like Russians, Greeks, scasies, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and havens live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are called ghost cities in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these violins.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and published here with friendly authorization.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places will be known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink british frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians, who are in transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with grinding, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for hotel - however, there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells people in full minibuses and from the top of the coast they start to cry out: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the time it's more quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also been sleeping on cartons outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She helps them also and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy medications that they can't pay, they massaged them with a balm that drew from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived at a short time.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard by other directions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the circuit," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and the Africans often travel along the way and that Africans speak already on WhatsApp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his followers Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money, to buy the ticket ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our Mother and we never let them go again," "" "he answered, smiling." "" "we will always be in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells that her guests have often send text messages if they are gone to greet them, to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city there is a impasse to JesÃºs Valenciano.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family received migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman, and has found that the bus tickets are sold to numerous African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking location outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencian declares that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they're experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants open also the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to press him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, one of the sole, has offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travellers consulted their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has got 20 new guests, a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud Grandmother she blazeth her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair flees who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs at sadness, while she introduces them shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Ya se fuerone, "repeats every time every time." they have already gone. "</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">One check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter-users have an average of one's and said.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi were given a cell phone notification where the District government refers to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication message, the app" "" "tells us that the app" "" "should have access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities noses to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app before they were installed with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was to determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activity and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, by online fraud, Trousers and phishing sites to make users alert as much time they spend online, and remote control of their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these functions can, of course, be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers capable to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority interests like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict regions, the authorities often order extreme censors and security measures, as well as routinemic Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media outlet "Images from Mainland China" (percentration in China), the censored news in China, displayed photos of a checklist at which policemen have checked the residents out if they had the monitoring app installed.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They compelled the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-growing technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (percentration of the marriages!) also published a Jingwang product description, from which highlights that the software can lift up a Windows operating system and receives unrestricted access to the computer's hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities, and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a decree involving all residents and entrepreneurs, up to August 1 their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" and destroy this action, however, the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible publishers, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me said that I had to get accustomed to being punished, although I had done nothing to make this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">A punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pluck as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the "lovingly" confession. "</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic pipe, which probably comes from the monarch.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your hen remembers your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give Him a pleasure, you can not measure you with him and you cannot withhold your scream.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cry made him not enough, so they cast out the tube through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">When I first asked, I asked whether the investigator had worked as a garbage collector, or if that was part of the normal working class.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables in each other to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour, three of them changed while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all the feeling in my body - and my voice, which I listened to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The Henker remarked the cooling and did not find any favor in it, so it was the next to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity through my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body, stretched out on the floor, was the perfect power manager.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two awful hours he decided that he had done his duty to this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">That must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to go to sleep again. let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The door opens and the morning light meets the room ".Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"" "I answer with the voice of an exhausted young people:" "" "my lord, my father has to worry terrible troubles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk away, you'll be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they were always released.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he turns to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But on what you can depend, is a cigar between his fingers or his duotine-picked lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the Supreme Court of his family house which has been among them since 1967; the year in which Israel met his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, who is being transferred to the conservative majority and exploration of gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, often concerned with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugee, he also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only found in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that spread from Damascus in Syria by far to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At his age 25, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted in its thinking, and he can have compassion on their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he triumphed with US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugee of the second generation" - so he himself describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "stresses Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he poured into two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senselingly hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the coins speak lukewarm coffee and the squadden of the Kent Cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you take a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">It is therefore easy to do it simply to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to get stuck in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry called Jordanians a gig of the band Mashrou 'Leila cancelled, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic Emirate - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country, contradict the main reason for the concert night.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "was canceled" "" "because of the sexual orientation of the scary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim to claim the commitment of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, Human Rights and free expression in the Arab world, which represents the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continued to integrate "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement may be probably not simply silky rhetoric, but rather an evident-crystallifying reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs's plant clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib, traditional family-care about body, constituted his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly written, unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of them, they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'Honorary de' has increased to the unofficial outwards.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary citizens in 2016 reached its peak; however, the institutional infrastructure is lacking to support women, victims attempted murder or domestic violence, to the appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime control from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of inappropriate violence, "and for their release often is a years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the warranty of the family needs nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to reverting issues, which were gging for a long time in its country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, but he grants us that he's his music, the full explicit attraction on sexuality, freedom and expression, can not separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was saying to me, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" there's focus on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically active in the core, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song the verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, in which one can, in his words, "that can be what you want" - whether it is Faith or Nonsense, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that no one speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya, to notice that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a worked version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance of homosexuals do not deduct Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained in remembrance thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat was supposed to work even on behalf of the caliph, in the eighth century openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier do it?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou's Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices are put to silence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took part several former government members and members of the Teacher's Association, with the grounds that they had written down on the comments in social media, linked with the deeply rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that, the concert Hdaibs are considering just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge it is to create structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him is progress an independent and take. Jordan has shifted an appearance on the second time in a row, but the way of progress - such as Hdaib - consists of slow, bedtime and internal changes. it is certain that these changes are held from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He doesn't dream of being his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will lead to the region using music, art and literature of a real and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, Streumunitions and at artificial nature. at least, he hopes.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to ribs and also resist resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made through the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which aman is considered a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebula in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One thought that there is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory is that the drums, the drums and dancing more than one thousand years have come from north-east Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to force the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a couple of great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint venture in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literal.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have a long time I look at the Meguro Gajoen: two sidecar races just to see.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nonetheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer Festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18-meter high arm was unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Seldom were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitimate profession like those of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street noise and illegal drug dealers are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - how many other Central and South American countries witnessed a rising demand for aesthetic services to men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the quirky hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to constantly prove more normalities to the experienced hands of hairdressing who can reproduce this hairless hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of Frisbee "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts opposite each other to show who can create the externally-centsten Looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions there are on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, found in El Callao here, found here an opportunity to exchange young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice to find a training in the hairdresser's art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering possibilities dozens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year in March and reported about some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrillas</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the printed version of the Beiter "Liebeshoods of guerrillas," which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve has published.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to humans we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is there not much more important, people who have outcast out affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question came the two young Columbian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the head and inspired them to write to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconcile), the young people encouraged to write guerrillas letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered that the signing of the peace treaty was so important that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of Colombia, it is still a long way to talk about an effective reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillacrobbers, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a rhetorrhetoric, and around the clock their weapons were forced to integrate into life as a civilian.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society again, which had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of profound hatred toward guerrillas, must now be able to support them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia is joined together and would help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love stories to former guerrillas, to welcome them back in the society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign's aim is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrillas - which will then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Laureates who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, the Nobel Peace Prize for 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we love the people we love to write on the day of thousands of love letters, but those who forget them need much necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he talked further to share his love with people this year, which needed for most urgent additives.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan, letters full of hope and support for former militants of the FARC. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were gathered in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would be pardoned '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to a UN camp in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogotart traveled to the camp to overtake letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC wondered how they had previously done to meet the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of supplication of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all those involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings you can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," said the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former militant led me to the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a sort of refuge in which the guerrillas living) looked in, I saw a guerrillas who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-pomper, a lethal weapon in the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="2211">And I said to him, "Hello, what are they doing?" he answered, "I answer a letter which someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never even in my life has written a bit so beautiful, that's why I answer it. "then suddenly tears walked over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I impoverished him completely, and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighting, and would help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life as war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would give me my mistake.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a company outside there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start of the students, students and the FARC leader came together to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were raised up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society in this country more fair.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a goal of these magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles, "one of them said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">These people have never found to hear, and had no electoral law, and to recognise that the people I have seen as a monster, and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were shot through their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me, that all men - even those who have killed and done so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters were responding to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for instance by DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columnist has been prophesied that after the disarmament of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise and protesting their rights, and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We are now putting peace of the FARC on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - of all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, afford our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from my own experience, that nothing is easy. those among us who defending life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be impending.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat posed by a Damoklist over the DLGBT community is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of their experiences with us and talked about us what is currently happening in the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Several months ago, LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines, after reports that were published, killing torture and killing queens men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaja Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who took suspicious queere men and awoke them into secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transformer was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since her childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, her consciously believed that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which was why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechnya had learned from the gender equality of their land, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">She was afraid of her life, the last entry into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It turned out to be a friend of Dagestan, a transformer that put into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took it without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet, with my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen Friends, with the following message: "then there are no men any more in Chechnya who can eliminate this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents were on the round of WhatsApp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just doing some shopping bag from the seat of my cars, I heard a male voice: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard a set, but this time on Chechen: "how long do you want to honor the family, you?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I don't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that there was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up the final end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had to get all along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two sampling in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor stood up and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful to him that he had passed respectfully with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats from last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, foreigners, some perfectly unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The demanded of sending me to Chechnya in order to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some said to me, I have to prove it without going up without the roads; others wanted me to change in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad, and photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have baskets size C - what would I have to say about television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family attempts to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the entire Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">She became too much for my mother, and put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a flat and a few hours later there was a car with a darkened window panes and a license plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends check out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to spend their names, but I will say that I remember them all. they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mum when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it, without pre-register, without reference without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you do not believe in security, just because you have forsaken the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already, in which hotel you steckst. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it: it's the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality, but this is a tabloid.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements have I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So I wish I would like to overcome this seelic barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we chatting with camera, I actually give myself trouble as the person remembers, which she remembers them from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that's very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report on the last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed some latest information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody who had dinner a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan had no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he ended a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives now.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this, my I, they probably invite the relatives of them, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" through blood is satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says that there would be not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relations or who were dropped from their relatives to set Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be arrested there, so that you can present them later than terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they have attacked any village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but submerged to radialize itself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that now merely a shifting or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was involved, when these people were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports yet. however, we assume that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could one not allow this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia originally wanted to bring us down to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but we finally threw us into the stoneage." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knocked; I had coloured eyelashes, bore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of the Sharia never gave me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spotte did not say about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says to children, if they are happy about the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes before you shut up because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never have insulted me, never hunted and never roamed.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this gift come from?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he started talking about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but rather than the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started in the city to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had laughed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I was able to feel like the situation in the republic is getting worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action do you go right now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much appreciated in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communed with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, meeting, I join them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself as I wipe off the curse.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidalab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Thus, nature, that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to draw you with foam in front of the mouth that there is no gay with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the Cabardiner, which are the Russians also, on the entire planet it is - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fades in Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know, many think about transitive identity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a kind of action.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation to be exact, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad about it - I simply know I am myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn an increase of self-morants within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong increase of self-morants for the last months.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab worker in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi was the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz, in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he sowed for his own helplessness, who can reach the inability to his family, so Ahwazi-Human Rights, who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">One of YouTube videos shared the moments after he had lit himself, firmly.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people make it fast to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleg. hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the internal combustion were so strong that the doctors couldn't do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on site warned that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - starts up.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: there were all family fathers, who felt themselves because of persecution on the Iranian government, helpless and unable to pursue their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, located in which vast majority of the Arab Ahwazi community is located, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to deny their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, Arabian Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy across Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest in Iran's oil and gas fields as well as some of the most valuable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources the regional economy is still growing slowly, and the local population will only get little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deduction.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the genealogy of Ahwazi's systematically workplaces in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of tribes, the waters of the Arabic areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These roofs have only led to destroying the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm-trees industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Acizi-adolescents rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Coatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who completed a job, completed primary school, 55% of a secondary school ended and 45% have completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestral human rights activist in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to an "high rise" of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become more recently worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functional and institutions does not prefer Arab labour force, the local Arab Ahwazi will have access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livelihood outside of their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, because even Arab names are not tolerated in the workplace, because speaking Arabian language or wearing Arabian clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances caused by the Arab Republic of Ahvazi, human rights activists propose an alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait, if the world is waking up and knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the object of several discussions where many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who describe themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even took scientific and social arguments from me, why I should be a feminist, and why we generally must be all femininity * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women have sooner or later in various areas of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender are still across across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I'm convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to skin color, racism, on black Cis women, on black male women, on black women in the LGBT community or to black women, as well as I mention, what kind of feminist movement, many white feminists decided to disclose many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women should come together to lift "their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing 'to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence gives an institutional form of racist motivated violence that we have black women exposed to two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnics and origin of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spouses and women with migrant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all men, neither skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman likes to take into account the unrighteousnesses in their thinking, which relate to both the gender and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">"" "" "" "I am exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminine sphere who always rejected me and countless other black women and always rejected." ""</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Soderner accused 1851 in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to justify an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will not attempt to oppose white women the importance of overcutting of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to increase it.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women in different approaches and borders with white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself full of feminism and join me of feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and give us into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves, that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately called Separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither exaggerated, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Nabil Musa travelled again in the past 7 years - mostly with a surf board or in a canoe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of the pollution of its community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I necessarily wanted to do something for the river we had lost as I was a child," says Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from around the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dust, pollution and uncontrolled development, to be led to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Alliance - which is involved and working in protecting "the rivers, streams, and waterways in Iraq, as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of turally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerpjer (# weightefree), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police officer said Ada BÃ¡ez, that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become violent against violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship had been passed and the police said, their testimony would be put to the files, but they could not do any more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As a further wife Balbuena demonstrated because of abuse, the opening ad of Ada BÃ¡ez made nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife moved their display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women keep viewing at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent upon men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to have victims of violence in the law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inaccounting 1 Weighing and Statistical 2 Unseen Missions and a Right-System that is not inferior to 3 swiss laws: good approach, lacking implementation beats and stats</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a research scientist at Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are several data and reports that are not even ansatise the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the Office of Attorney General Prosecutor dropped 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads came from the police.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence in peace violence. 86% of the ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In ads, 40% of women were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show however not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "on every woman who is refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "she explained in the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a own criminal, the prosecution authorities cannot be appropriately documented, how many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">At least 12 cases of women killed in the country alone until August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to estimates, in Paraguay every ten days died a woman due to violence against men.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer served with Carlos. but for two years she carried the psychic violence against women, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizable:</seg>

<seg id="2509">When I read in the past, I always thought that only women are going to be submissive, because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook, in which she described his insults and several attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos myself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised the hand against them, and refused to admit his behaviour was a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had liked it so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like that, as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner they lacked them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you"), that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk with others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not: they take the testimony of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without a result and also from its relatives, they won't receive support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against its former partner who developed into an unpredictable legal struggle between Paraguay and its home country in which it was primarily about money, power, and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Corrupt laws: good approach, lacking implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied.</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the advert of abuses is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "" "says Victoria Santos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, sees considerable problems with the use of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed under the hashtag # PorElla (# Princely).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law is to explain the femicidal to an independent criminal continuance and harder to punish as it is already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislature has changed in some points to win the Socialists and Democrats, who feared the way for decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had expected to cost most of the (bureaucratic and economic) process, which must carry out the victim of violence themselves, if they just want to deposit and receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argued that the law is not effective if the lawmakers don't have sufficient financial resources to provide:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse are seen as part of human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, there must be rethinking that violence is no longer regarded as a little Norte.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who, in view of these facts, are indebted, and contributes to the perpetrators of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refund so long, until abatment does not apply as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted at paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been modified. among other things a passage was knitted, which initiated the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The passage regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggressor to attack his victims.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the submission of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is regarded as a great setback.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" of turally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerpjer (# weightefree), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Medical research in Africa: opportunities and misunderstandings</seg>
<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture is done with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need of medical research, there are two reasons: for one of the offer of global healthcare industry many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical demand on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research that is carried out by African scientists himself will be solely promoting research and technology capacity in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrier is director of the Centre for the study of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he explored on the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research theme?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is based on the application of research results. I support the sambish national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also launch a research programme for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Gv: what are your opinion about most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we just implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receiver, rather than to be movers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get is often not well used in our surroundings, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Gv: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Gv: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">Gv: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Gv: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students in all age classes.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training starting in every age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from them.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Gv: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: there are often limited speed, things to do, and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines are accessible only against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton bred a salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as outreddish, the first plant cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was only forced through his own expatriation and the question of how many salmon varieties can get boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s it noted that more salads were patented and that he could not allow them to reproduce them.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or mapped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years, more of these patents have been registered on more plants such as grain or cartottensor. because of this trends, plant-makers, environmental protectors and experts ensure food security in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of thousands of ancient tradition, Morton is still making a salad, but he needs longer a longer time since his work is still becoming more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like that in a river a rock is lying around which I must be paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents will go on salads too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed any more new salads, because all features are already patented. "it makes as good as possible and tries to breed the features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and striving to use no material which is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also been connected to a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and everywhere on the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red Roman salat from the variety outredress in the "greenhouse" "greenhouse." there is being tested, whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name might sound like this, as it would come from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called in order to ensure that some plant species and organizations are not protected as intellectual property, and for plant breeding are permanent.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeder can agree that others can freely use the seed without them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeder can only allow others to breed their seeds, to breed so own varieties, and not immediately expelled - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emerized professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board, Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants and environmental protection as well as for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds plays a role in major merging such as biodiversity, rights of peasants, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would attempt to use the latter not or only little to use seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the open-source movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants may be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "if you want to buy our goal of ecological sustainability in the global agricultural industry, it is also important to know how it is grown to farmers markets, such as such vegetables is farmed, threatened by themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereign, without seed sovereign, is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">Members of the Open Source Seed initiative undertake to provide others their seed remains free to provide. so, in contrast, seed and plant features are to be patented.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi support argued that the future of food supply is endangered because of the usual gene pool, due to becoming more abundant spiritual property rights to plant material, which consequently be limited, shrinking as always.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Office of the Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation at carrots and their availability. she found out that roughly one-third of all cartel attributes are protected as intellectual property, which is either non-usable for plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are no estimates not yet, but experts such as Luby suggests that mass-conserved plants like wheat in even larger scale are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visions</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so farmed that they have targeted features - of such as their taste or colour improves up to such due to those in certain environments, and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder has more than ever more patents than ever before, as the changed conditions are much worse than ever before, because the change conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto's spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monopoly activities. with a total of four genes and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States, the company set up the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, this is contradictory that the intellectual property comprises other breeders, as "patents and the Protection of Plant Variant Innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another approach to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not prevent innovation, but promotes it, providing more material and know-how to be provided. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years of waiting, until a patent loop, certainly doesn't generate innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if you have to wait for so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general well and remain: "independent plant breeding have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their job.</seg>
<seg id="2671">This is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2672">Overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features: "we are not creating the features.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who are breeding a variety, also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures must be needed for cultivation of herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is genetically modified. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents make it the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patented, or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeding Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeder is characterized by avoidance of plant patrons' innovative: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than businesses that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors can sell my own varieties in a few years ago, "he says." with a patent for 20 years ago, it is very easy to make it easy. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the open source of breeding, the concept has spread rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which itself describes itself as a professional organization in resources, is an open source of traditional crops and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps to come to "open source" seed and sell her own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol works on an open-source license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for the breedings differ from country to land, because the Ossi obligation cannot be taken over one into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants could not be patented. thus, it concerns the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents are allowed in conventionally farmed plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is necessary to implement this new line in the governments of the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from whole East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend to disfocus seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos "program for" Open Source "seed systems, states that the organization is currently creating a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, scheduled for the planned next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organization USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a Association adopted by McKnight Foundation and others - represents the view that farmers have to have the opportunity to share and improve seed policy, thereby enabling a stable supply of food products.</seg>
<seg id="2694">In the report also the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems is emphasized - a connection, by the Luby by Ossi, hopes it will soon be recognizable by more people.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "" "" "the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly noticed where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role." "" "so Luby." "" "we are now attempting to make people clear that even more behind their food is" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organisation and Blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still unlock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a column.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 05.August the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world and report on selfishness.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network released a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised this step sharply, promised to continue working and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Sheet - despite this attack and the distortion of the Egyptian law and to defend a vote in this part of the world, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI was confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the lock and do not add. we insists on to fulfil our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language version of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web links to sacrifice. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI there is also no access to Egypt's blog and human rights studies Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the dissemination of columnists and articles that he will not write their accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to bypass the Egyptian government's Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which also Ziadas blog is home, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video like the police force physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly turn around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook commentary, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">However, to lock blogs is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be important for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is able to communicate a sense of siege to me; an arrest, an attempted murder, an attempt at the National Security Council, the blocking blogs, and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have an impact if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the posts of articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">However, after having locked him and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities opened up on 24 May to 06 August, 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of providers by converting Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we realized how to offer the blocking of websites, which VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the intention of blocking the government to block contents and filters, which could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation, in addition, is caused by the fact that the most exposed doors are hit behind closed doors, due to which the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by which they can proceed with court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">Fighting the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army is in use in the favela housing in NiterÃ³i, a city in the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: estado Maior (CML) via photos of PÃºblicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day for Day reports newspapers in Brazil, with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country, and home of numerous postcard designs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "14-year-old shot in school" "" "Each day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro killed," "" "thieves screwed pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a united financial situation, the threat from 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even proclaimed the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">So, released for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on 16th August the Editorial "This is not normal," in which it announced, a new section called "war in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes committed in any major city in the world as murder, robbery, sexual assaults, etc. everything that happens to the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so as journalists don't close our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, stated that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war of war in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist in the newspaper declares that there are 843 territories listed according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the Editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to tualize the atrocities of the police, which raises and then asks questions to tualize.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Is the term "war" more than it is profitable?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued to describe the violence as a "war." this is the opinion of a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it harder to account responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is no war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning, as shown in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with unsufficient investment in personnel, education and historical and complacent neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A peace march in NiterÃ³i in the state of Rio de Janeiro in honor of the murdered cultural organisers Rafael location.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">"" "according to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong, according to CecÃ­lia, according to CecÃ­lia, according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north east of the country. these are the most recent data available." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">No one of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the toll rates per federal state, Rio is on No.16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Specially belongs to the company Globo, the largest media business of South America, that emphasized how CecÃ­lia has been stressed the security policy of the State since years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">In addition to these safety policy measures, the founding of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit formed by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, was aimed at conquer a Favela police unit due to the use of a massive police bill.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline of nonviolent deaths. since a few years, the UPP, however, after several reports about chicans and repressions against the poor municipalities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, was increasingly under suss.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from an article published in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not comply with the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio will also cause serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this calls for the state to use, means and approaches, which are typical for a war. this is the intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and an object for "collateraldamage" and "distorted spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War, or ago, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police enclave the mountain with the Favela Jacareinho, to kill the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all these violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died due to shots that had fired the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years ago a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings which had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban is getting closer to their hatred for Hazara known.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">After a few days after his escape Asharaf found herself back in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohort. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar who were heavier than he himself to make his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was minted by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashark remembered an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, where we worked also.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hanging nylon before the open windows, so that we do not indulge in the night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">When the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Ashark homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church, which was divided twice a day meal at needy people.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a sort of second chance for commercial asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that seek asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centers." this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprocessed staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers may only be allocated for asylum if they officially filed an application for asylum - which, after the registration of asylum seekers can still go for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then there are people who have no money for accommodation, either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unfamiliar lifestyle helped Ashark to break out of these conditions soon.</seg>
