this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den had heard , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA listened illeg@@ ally from Americans .
but it &apos;s another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence service which has literally issued the CIA on Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not really like this chapter ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has identified against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this move , he became a symbol for the design of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and condemn journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get these information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they offer .
so , when the government stum@@ bled at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous journalists had already done before him : he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was thus living with the risk of going into prison .
but then , only days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had been so vital that it would be imper@@ ative to their case , the demands of the government dropped to iron .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can always hide less .
instead of being failure and r@@ ents to get statements , it could do his digital footprint for him .
so the investig@@ ators , without his permission , his telephone conversation is secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ w@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and frac@@ ture , meant to condemn .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more convicted than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has a lot of work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of having a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more possibilities to sp@@ it all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just like technology the government allowed to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better .
and in fact , they can contact them from the moment in which they contact , instead of a desc@@ ending , in the testimony .
today , there are communication software that had not yet been written as R@@ isen , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls .
such technology is a Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ al system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ renowned , which was developed by us by the previous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
rather than to send an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can instantly upload documents or send documents , just like any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot complain about any more information , and many of the information that she would like would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments are always developing new spy technologies , which are all vulnerable to us .
it is to ensure that not only technology professionals like Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to bring mis@@ et@@ ates . it is equally important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower ,
the more about abuse during the supply of soldiers modest and over@@ crowded hospitals will report . or the next environmental workers , the alarm for contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover their crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest data base of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rei@@ che and M@@ igh@@ ty &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sum of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; This week we were signed by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
there are reports that a consortium of the brutal Syrian dictator , Bashar al @-@ Assad Letter @-@ based companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others that are nervous , waiting to the next release , and the next dis@@ closure documents .
now that sounds like the plot of agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems cri@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is , when the rich and poor in the position are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some of the few people to hide and con@@ sp@@ ect them -- something that we have been discussing and reveal themselves for ten years .
I think many people appears this whole world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always put it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so , one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones .
it may be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what matters is .
I also find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably , because there have been no prominent Americans who previously appeared in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data collection of the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some US states , less information needs to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library crew .
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed it to rip school children from school districts .
it has allowed bet@@ ting , especially an@@ gled investor .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent another investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister to buy susp@@ icious money in the US to buy a home , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked that everyone would make suggestions to a lawyer from our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money .
these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course , nobody was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has under@@ spread our play@@ ful investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single top politicians , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very strange , as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a borrow@@ ed optim@@ ist I see quite that something has started to change .
over the past few years , we have seen cl@@ ashes on more transparency , affecting the owners of firms .
political attention was found by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really stands behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have taken a draft bill in both parliament chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure in the United States and global for greater transparency .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that arise and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of in@@ transparency .
together , we can finally end the In@@ transparency , which now allows for this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering .
this is the story , as I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the boot of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him only ! he said he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to be back in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air bed . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken out there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , on the toe of the door to the door , and my sleeping door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me today depends on his class@@ room . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view@@ point .
maybe the people , who were sold to me in childhood , were actually friends who were waiting only to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air bed , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air matt@@ resses .
let us make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I knew how we could earn something . our apartment will stay with a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mat@@ rat@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on the air matt@@ resses on wood floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese ham el@@ ettes tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle , Brian and I joined us .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
my former fellow , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a web site , on which people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their baths -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are closed when visiting .
you can then invite a strange person over the Internet , to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket was lit .
but they are not .
no one who is still throughout consol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all lear@@ nt to children , strangers are dangerous .
when one has a problem , one gets on the things you can do well . we could design@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create great confidence , between people who had never met before .
can design be like this ?
is it possible to create trust in design trust ?
I would like to give you a taste , which degree confidence we stri@@ pped .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up , if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone your left seat .
this quiet destination of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , you can see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a fore@@ ig@@ ner in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
most guests feel , if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
but who actually has Al Go@@ res mobile now ?
could you tell Twitter that he is the president of the president ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first imag@@ ined once with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 evaluations , they all say : &quot; he can really stick out very well @-@ sper@@ sed mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone ?
a well @-@ known feedback system strengthens trust significantly .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative payments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were handed over before we asked them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are in terms of age and home .
surprisingly , we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less trust we .
this is a natural social default .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
if one has less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation seek out simil@@ arities .
so the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences .
moreover , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you can buy .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you tell too little about how &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer .
one tells too much how to say , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also not accepted .
so there is an optimal degree to op@@ enness , such as &quot; Great Art@@ work in your apartment ! I &apos;m making a holiday with my family holiday . &quot;
how to make design create that degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write to something .
our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards strangers .
with which we hadn &apos;t reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
the shop is running very well for us .
of course , there are times even if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were un@@ permitted , celebrated parties or have been devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front , when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it &apos;s hurt when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that hear@@ eth in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further .
thank@@ fully , there had only a problem of 123 million nights only a fra@@ ction of a problem .
because people trusted in one another .
when trust works , wonder can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts drove him to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who are incl@@ ined to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ra are real gu@@ ardian angel who save life , even though they don &apos;t know it right .
you drive a hospital in your own car , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can stay one even longer , without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not everyone runs off .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I met this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of the particles fit together with money transactions ?
it is here about an economic trading .
but now just call the &quot; rent industry &quot; it is not just to be justified .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of himself open , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what would be , however , if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a group there , to have a thoroughly complete and one in a bar cra@@ w@@ l quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or if you can cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to make apartments of reason to be shared ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would have received the thoughts of shared shared ?
I imagine cities , which allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and loss .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
we were now offering hab@@ our . students who were looking for a stay ,
people were convey@@ ed to people whose children were moved . they were incub@@ ators @-@ programs ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today , more than our platform will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries with a fore@@ ig@@ ner or even hosts .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be so crazy about how it was taught .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality gave it already before .
there were similar websites already .
so why has just our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the review of confidence .
design can help us overcome pro@@ oted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think that &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it whenever a red Maz@@ da is passing away on me .
we know , of course , design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had such a great impact , I wonder what we can utili@@ ze design soon .
thank you .
what do you think , when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , under@@ gone a cereb@@ ral under@@ wear , a terrorist act ?
or simply a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
thus , the media are people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met some Muslims : it is great you know .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ wers @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to carry the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
my Femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing : at that time it was a feminist independence of independence , on the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to me a perfect and un@@ att@@ achable beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought after , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en themselves with each of the cor@@ ans .
the beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , and yet love you ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineers .
I later , after my marriage , a child , and was basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then there was a terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , looking at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly in indig@@ nation .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; from the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others from another ci@@ dent in a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and start in the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I left -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ble@@ w in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t touch you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
it was then Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered to prayer .
and again the war@@ nings : &quot; not on this first fri@@ day , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably well , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or of those who stood for Muslims in the Free and struck .
there was really bran@@ ding on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt un@@ true .
because people who have attacked this land , attacked our land .
I pushed the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain to yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
there are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today , we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumour in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor can be removed as a whole and ben@@ ign tumour only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are inventor and teacher , Sustain@@ er and Olympic Ris@@ ks .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
maybe there will be some parking , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to study people of other faith , and show greater civil participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , it is determined that it begins online . as a first person , the person is cut off from her church , so that the person believes that the person believes that the people ab@@ h@@ ors the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and their ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or by faith .
if we want to stop radic@@ alisation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still maintain that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS founded their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but when you take a look at them , they don &apos;t drive what they l@@ ases in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which they can read these things into Scripture .
a remarkable im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because they thought to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every mind that she spoke to silence , she said to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of in@@ justice in the world , she only would bring into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had given its anger sense , it was a main goal for the instrument by extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke to her a solution .
this Im@@ am made the connection to God and her church again .
rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed a construc@@ tive path for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
that was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family concerns .
but how does ordinary Americans work out ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption increase every day on our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neu@@ rosci@@ enti@@ st studies -- show : if we fear ourselves , at least three things happen .
we accept a authorized government system , con@@ form@@ ity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : if one report reviews , in which negative on Muslims were reported , they voted in rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood sw@@ apping Muslims to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two peri@@ odic periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manifest to the public to eliminate the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning signs .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear makes us all .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not only about to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous human being , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did a young man become a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne on her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment as with a execution when he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he f@@ lowed eight times at De@@ ah .
Fan@@ ati@@ smus cannot only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about to leave America we to our children : one that would control us through fear , or , in which we can practice our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
we drove up with our son in the children &apos;s seat , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and took my shoes , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked , and welcomed our guests , because the half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to join us .
at this moment , I have broken together .
these people were there , because they had taken courage and compassion , and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ atism ?
will you be sure to go for sure ?
or if you join them that mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks a lot !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say that you think you &apos;re holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a monument with depth are to work in a noble reas@@ oning , i.e. an exception , and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say you don &apos;t fool . I am completely normal .
I &apos;m not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as usual .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever @-@ led study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
if people appear as an exception to rule , often the rule is broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler began to become a billi@@ on@@ store just before .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air put@@ ations entered into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built live in front of an audience of six meters high tower in France . some years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting connecting air conditioning high speed and acceleration in tight space .
you can also build a self @-@ resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and react in general in nature .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possi@@ bil@@ ites in the autonomous flight .
in order to operate an autonomous system , it must collec@@ tively know where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , calculations put on board , what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at highest levels . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a f@@ lap .
like other star@@ ring fisher@@ man , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can ho@@ ver , and has great benefits at start and landing , and is very diverse .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear stern is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind balls .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aviation device doesn &apos;t matter what is able to recover the optimal position and improve performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions leading to the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts that will be met for you to hurt you .
before decades ago , skilled pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern .
recently we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est control unit . it was invented recently .
there is only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ sters , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , just a prop@@ eller .
although mechan@@ ically is simple , inside the interior lives a lot , so that it can fly stable , and move around in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hed@@ ge@@ cutter . to bring it to fly , I must throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood to throw it right when I see all , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in gen@@ om@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ eller , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is not symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space to move in all directions , no matter what direction he is filmed or even like it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight &quot; Prop@@ eller . &quot;
a lot is conc@@ ei@@ vable in models , the rest is lear@@ nt directly to fly .
let &apos;s see that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
it turns clock@@ wise in clock@@ wise .
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller strikes out , the electronics or a battery -- can fly to the machine if limited .
we will now demonstrate that , making a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration was investigated synthetic swar@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit it with local technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine , there is a flying lamp screen on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types such as us the reward is in the development and the creation act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creature allowed to form it so spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant Galaxy , two black holes were moved in a very far away , so the mass of three sun sets in pure energy .
for this short moment , they brigh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of all the familiar universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy was not set free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time tissue and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
then we arrange the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago , the world had just emerged on Earth .
since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , dinosau@@ rs , humans and -- God stand upon us -- even the internet .
around 25 years ago I decided to build a group of especially brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most held them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as a crazy geni@@ uses so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ry Gra@@ vity Observ@@ atory Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was considerably increased , which significantly improved the recognition performance .
so you call him Advanced Lig@@ o now .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final trial run by some smaller , hard @-@ minded problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes passed through the Earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector itself .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my father @-@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all this for what I &apos;ve been working is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories as lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational ha@@ fts ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a c@@ ud@@ ation in the bottom of space and time .
during the passing of the wave , space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and turns into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers lead to the Rel@@ ativity Theory often a properly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and dust , stret@@ ching and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each one was stretched out by us when the waves was stretched out and the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this , one explained the lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer long laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear point . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k .
at the end of his classic text on Gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in construction of such det@@ ectors are massive .
but physi@@ cists are fin@@ alist , and with the support of the public , all barriers will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
return to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o was more than one eye than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones .
this is quite practical . because so you can create a picture or a map of things , by touching the coming of several points next light around you .
in killing is that different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult to make a picture of things that make you very much :
the face of your child .
instead we listen to specific features such as pitch and -@@ height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make them simple images of objects in all .
but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear the all literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation of a li@@ fel@@ ess can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two body very quickly , you can hear the same circuit with an additional sound change . it sounds like that : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu wu wu :
it is a sort of movement of motion , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Y@@ SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass that are around as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : just think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ ns , the other with a mass of 36 sun , revol@@ ve each one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ es a whole new way to explore the universe as it never was possible before .
on this way , we can listen to all the sounds and the un@@ seen .
all in all , we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about the space .
however , the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never see , as this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ation @-@ waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the pri@@ ck : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the pri@@ ck is covered with his own replica .
through gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea . things we are only discovering by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things just in the first run of things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this issue : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o makes us an entirely different perspective on events in all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately to look forward as we came out of this may@@ hem .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build a glorious det@@ ectors and listen to the cos@@ mos and chir@@ p of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Observ@@ atory -- a completely new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the original ?
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year long I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it felt nervous , taught me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; to me .
would I speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on television live ?
no , but yes !
would I like to start playing with the foam ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do when I was afraid , frigh@@ tened my fears .
I &apos;m afraid to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , that changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it started with a question of my youngest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called for un@@ explained reasons all the &quot; Sch@@ itt@@ ens , &quot;
she would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cookies , I need milk for my snor@@ keling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was wonder@@ ing if I could play with her when I was just on the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I sw@@ am to play with them whenever you call me . no matter what I &apos;m going to do , or where I go , I say always Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I we@@ ari@@ ed myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but there was also an amazing side effect : only recently I was completely mis@@ understood that &quot; yes &quot; -@@ S@@ ort saved my career with my children .
I have a real dream job .
I am a author . I think things off , stir up your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I have television , in large style .
in this TV season , I &apos;m responsible for responsible for 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every programme offers hundreds of jobs that are not existing before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which simultaneously in production are four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run back on Thursday night .
across the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ tain@@ able . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn round the world .
do you know who still makes it ?
nobody , that is why I am a titanium .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who are so hard working as if you are using a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously , so you understand that I &apos;m not only looking around the computer , and it &apos;s true , when I say : I understand that at a dream job is not about dreams .
it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat - no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I feel in work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as a dream , you make a marathon , they delivered a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working to work .
it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and maternal , clin@@ ically and spirit@@ ually , cruel and rational . and the best thing about it is the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a sum@@ s begin in my head , and it is growing and growing , and the sum@@ s listen like a busy street , I could go for ever .
many people assume that when I expl@@ aining the sum@@ s that I am writing about writing that the letter is ready for me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with TV production , when I started working and work and work , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t stri@@ ve differently than to size .
the feeling , not differently to stri@@ ve to stri@@ ve for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it is also a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not doing for failure , and I just know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to say to you , I am a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want it to ask .
to be clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work more , the more work at the same time , the more in the same time , the more you write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country , which I run , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
worked , revised , exagger@@ ated , burned down .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that their Mama is a single working class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Emer@@ son says : &quot; cookies , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby titles .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s heard .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , processed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , don &apos;t exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me , silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s .
so what do you do when doing what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
I know some of them think : &quot; gr@@ as@@ l you out , the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
but you know , you are doing what you are doing , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and that &apos;s like the sum@@ s , when the sum@@ s stops when the sum@@ s stops , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
when the song of my heart hears , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; South @-@ state @-@ wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way to the outside , it &apos;s late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no , when two things are aware of :
&quot; &quot; &quot; firstly , I have to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and secondly , she called me not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls nobody &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when will this happen ?
I miss it when I am titanium and my sum@@ s , and everything changes in front of my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
that is nothing special .
we play and play their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of money , I can do nothing but to miss .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country , which I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wa@@ xes and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Ice Queen &quot; lets you get rid of .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and a Energi@@ esch@@ ub comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is here .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel when I know a magic secret .
but let us remain with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we &apos;ve forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the work@@ horse , the titanium dioxide , that is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I say to you , who I am I describe using my brain , and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not force , and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the genuine sum@@ s is dependent on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from the life of life .
the genuine sum@@ s is self consciousness and peace .
the genuine sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , which anticip@@ ates experience , expec@@ tation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
the real sum@@ s of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a firm rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt .
it is a law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
they don &apos;t play ans@@ at@@ tw@@ ise as we work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer more than home at home .
this entry is painful , for what a man would rather than to be home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed , none of them is .
we r@@ asen around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
in doing so , I mainly feel sti@@ ff , absent , and confused .
I always att@@ acker to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! tell them if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me for nai@@ ve , for a day dre@@ aming .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is just 15 minutes .
my little ones would like to play at the most 15 minutes with me until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ le or bis@@ cuit replaced me .
and speak my Teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more needs it not .
everybody can bring about 15 minutes each , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes at play !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are finished .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my welfare , my world . it must not be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m shy and I victories . friends meet , read books that enjoy day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to pass more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s then seems to return , if I am not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without any games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , they comp@@ lies with me and my soul . they lead me into new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t I ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it is me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too much work and to play . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything in handle . my brain is yet functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , which I run , the troops , the wall walls , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the other , the right sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s feel , the more makes this unusual , lasting , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel that sum@@ s feel , the more I know who I am .
I am a author . I think things off , I would raise you to life .
that belongs to the job , that means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks a lot .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from a second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system the patients often have permanent , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I was functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures .
for sure they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain @-@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; this is im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe citrus and severe pain .
however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story started 15 years ago .
at the time I was Senior Physi@@ cian and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I supplied patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a increases the brain and increases the skull pressure .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
to make up cells of a tissue , comparable to small children , which are taken out of your families .
you have to find the correct food , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve it .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean François Hollande made it .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the biology class that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we did a further fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ortal .
but these cells were different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell@@ population that looked like stem cells but was different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ um cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the F@@ öt@@ us stage , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get to us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
this is not so safe .
one thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
this we had to prove .
so , we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then mix the cells exactly as cultivated , as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then , colour@@ less , to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ planted them at the exception of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ planted the same cells in a prec@@ ari@@ ed brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells , and now , the cells remained -- they came up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells we colored in vitro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey , to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
you had to take food pellets for one tablet .
they made them very well .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we did last in the mot@@ ic c@@ ort@@ ex to the hand motor skills area .
so the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen to people , it recovered spont@@ aneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of pl@@ asti@@ ly brain mechanisms . it rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , who recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance in front of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after Rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were very exciting for us too .
since that time , we have found out much more about these cells .
we can freeze it and then use it later .
we can use them in other neurop@@ ath@@ ology models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s .
but our dream is still , however , to im@@ plant them to people .
I really hope to show you soon , as the human brain has the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do this . &quot;
I definitely get there .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , one needs about two kilograms of papers and forms out to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it will take until someone can get to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
it already needs a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is certain of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the West , we make a big mistake , as of course .
we don &apos;t see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant , which is in reality , but as inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changeable ge@@ op@@ enness .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have definitely proven that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy van@@ ishes in us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was told me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- did not affect the austerity schemes that were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better jus@@ tification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my recep@@ tion@@ ist friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they would change anything .
at this point , I want to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you to believe in , together with me , that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
without democracy , our societies are formed , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted .
on the subject of waste , I want to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain which throws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but only few recognize his r@@ dy@@ mus .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous , however , is to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one might maintain the debt mountain and could also produce all the things that mankind is ur@@ gently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the United States , in England and the euro zone , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , g@@ alley , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound a lot of money until you compare it to the same time in the same countries and financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did if the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices are high .
thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit that do not correspond with the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently , a low demand for the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could not invest in which it might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
in@@ war@@ med the circumstances that causes oil to kill him .
that is my Ha@@ des with Capit@@ alism --
his most extravag@@ ant Art. All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve human talents , and develop particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are key to salvation of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy than the form of form in which the free and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the job worth of ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these connections .
the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor , and not only the right to free expression , but more important and crucial , which she admitted them the right to political participation with the same mood in questions of the state of state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been kept long --
like a candle that is very bright , it is also burned down quickly .
however , our liberal democra@@ cies have not their roots in an ancient Athens ,
but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling .
for the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was ren@@ ounced on politics , while the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democra@@ tised zone .
in our today &apos;s democra@@ cies , since the time since the separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually mig@@ rat@@ ory politics .
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because you can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics is w@@ aved into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ v@@ eins with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is in about as a herd of rob@@ ber@@ y , who nour@@ ishes the animals , of which it nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is star@@ ved in the end .
similarly , it is similar to the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ b@@ alized by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political property is dev@@ al@@ uation , the ine@@ quality is falling , and the managing director of the corporations are anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their enterprises .
the successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twins peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour and the welfare of mankind .
if that &apos;s true , it &apos;s obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
that &apos;s not a new idea by the way .
the Marx@@ ist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and was not particularly well done .
the doctrine of de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor will only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ishing the working poor !
capitalism does , taking out low @-@ cost workers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separated , the automation of the twin summit will be higher , the waste generated , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and thereby paying attention to the re@@ united area , otherwise we would like to appear in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ tie , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentation .
the question is not , whether capitalism has caused the technical accompl@@ ishments he will survive .
the most interesting question is whether capitalism are replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in the machines that serve people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans , or in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we may be optim@@ istic .
so how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I want to give you , in all coming soon , some examples .
in the field of companies , please ask a capital market where you are working and in which your capital is working on you from a job site to the next , and the company -- no matter what you &apos;re currently working -- is the property of those who work currently in the company .
then all income from capital and revenues originate and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
there are no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they are not involved in it , and employees working there in which the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and spar@@ ar , and ultimately no emp@@ oral twins peaks .
in the field of global political economy : just imagine that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare .
this is not a new idea .
this is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods conference from 1944 .
the problem was that , at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in front of the background of a re@@ united policy and economy .
the world I describe you is simultaneously liber@@ ating , in which they prefer privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nesi@@ an , global key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we get in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to take political together .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ ary Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , is Marx relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next one , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I &apos;m completely in@@ verteb@@ ra@@ zed .
BG : actually , and now we are too .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the Red@@ ner , you said clearly what you &apos;ll keep from the West &apos;s perspective on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies we have the certificate of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the time plays , -- the area of the economy -- an entirely democratic zone .
in some ways , when I may say that this is the pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the Great Britain of the 19th century .
for -- do you remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically viewed .
Liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical , regarding the democratic development .
what can be observed in China now , is very similar to the development we had in England throughout the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now attemp@@ ting to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , is sm@@ ooth@@ ed to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I realized that this happens .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the di@@ gesti@@ ble failure to say that a massive inter@@ medi@@ ation line passed through the Eurozone , and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek accus@@ ation -- by the way , the first suggestion was to be revealed this den@@ ial --
it &apos;s right to make it right . unfortunately , the powers in the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued to deny den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you attempt to get an economic system that is not able to obtain life through political will and author it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it will perhaps be delayed until a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change do you see beforehand ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone won &apos;t have a future if we do not change their setup .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a decent situation , claimed that he did not have mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt relief program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the money makers to find a common solution .
but this did not exist .
they just wanted to bring our government to fall , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with those who were disp@@ le@@ ased by the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one from the Tro@@ ika &apos;s Tro@@ ika , imposed on this policy , conf@@ essed : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er mistake . &quot;
BG : despite all these , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the Eurozone won &apos;t survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they did not survive , the cent@@ ered fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disast@@ rous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we suggest to suggest the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 that it appears to me , it will be as well to be the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard the most yet , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is duc@@ ing employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a yellow cure and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose anything .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are located right on this bend .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation works from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then one has a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that you are addic@@ ted , where , after one has looked a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should be enough to tell you what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to accommodate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he turns out more thoughts on the mean extermination , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just inspire them .
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something like this , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants to ris@@ er nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online , where it can look for free .
and if Amazon is for free stuff , you access , right ?
millions of viewers look at this episodes .
however , they do not know they are watched at the watching of these shows .
you are watched by Roy and his team to record everything .
you capture , when you start the show , when you p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts are ski@@ pped and check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon was to make a Sit@@ com through four Republican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it was not so good .
it is only an average show -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landing at 7,5 -- so something above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out .
at the same time , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super @-@ show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different .
instead of taking a contest , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course they like shows , etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows them , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a w@@ agon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this Show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; get a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where to go .
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies .
they combine these many dates and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow says that this should work with everything .
if one collec@@ ts millions of data , it is a decision to meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the worst thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis is not working so , this is a bit sc@@ ary , because we live in a time we are going to make more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software . come in contact , you are in prison .
if someone asks here in the United States in prison and ask for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is performed or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems doesn &apos;t know how to use data .
the data are also sealed by companies .
yes , even Google makes mistakes .
in 2009 Google announced that through data analysis algorithms from flu , the worse kind , you can say , by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news coverage . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked imm@@ aculate , year around the year , until it didn &apos;t work suddenly ,
and nobody could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the release of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data are sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all of these errors , data em@@ iss@@ ed in decisions of life - at work , in the legal en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so , we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly have two things :
when emp@@ loying this problem in its parts , you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , you put the components back together to put a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just fine for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put together the parts together and then come to a decision .
there is another tool , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is possible to summar@@ ize parts and pieces , even if the information is in@@ complete , so it is especially when the brain is an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience if they were otherwise unable to have . but the decision to put together all these parts and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that she went into a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , however , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House . &quot;
it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices , but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order to forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; Magic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will later interpre@@ t it later with a demo @-@ demo .
I have so far met some decisions in my life , with what I would have to listen to the ball .
but , as you can , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . finally , it &apos;s up to meet decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I received this as a very hear@@ ti@@ fying message that despite the great amount of data is still going out to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing , and risks to go .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks in which you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks a lot .
