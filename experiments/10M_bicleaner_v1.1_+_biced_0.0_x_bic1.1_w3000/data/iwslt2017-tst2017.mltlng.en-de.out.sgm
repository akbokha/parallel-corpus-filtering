<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard Edward Snowden had heard, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA listened illegally from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it's another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence service which has literally issued the CIA on Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not really like this chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has identified against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move, he became a symbol for the design of the government, whistleblower and condemn journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get these information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they offer.</seg>
<seg id="14">So, when the government stumbled at Risen, he did something that many courageous journalists had already done before him: he refused and said that he would prefer to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was thus living with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had been so vital that it would be imperative to their case, the demands of the government dropped to iron.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of being failure and rents to get statements, it could do his digital footprint for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">So the investigators, without his permission, his telephone conversation is secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and fracture, meant to condemn.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has more convicted than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has a lot of work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of having a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint, because the government has more possibilities to spit all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like technology the government allowed to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better.</seg>
<seg id="29">And in fact, they can contact them from the moment in which they contact, instead of a descending, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that had not yet been written as Risen, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a SecureDrop, an open source transmittal system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-renowned, which was developed by us by the previous Aaron Swartz, and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Rather than to send an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can instantly upload documents or send documents, just like any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot complain about any more information, and many of the information that she would like would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments are always developing new spy technologies, which are all vulnerable to us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is to ensure that not only technology professionals like Edward Snowden have a possibility to bring misetates. it is equally important that we protect the next Whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">The more about abuse during the supply of soldiers modest and overcrowded hospitals will report. or the next environmental workers, the alarm for contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover their crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the greatest data base of the history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that Reiche and Mighty] have hidden [enormous sum of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to a statement.] This week we were signed by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's law firm Mospack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mospack Fonseca go and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are reports that a consortium of the brutal Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad Letter-based companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin is leading to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others that are nervous, waiting to the next release, and the next disclosure documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, when the rich and poor in the position are to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some of the few people to hide and conspect them -- something that we have been discussing and reveal themselves for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appears this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always put it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So, one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It may be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there is less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably, because there have been no prominent Americans who previously appeared in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mospack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data collection of the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some US states, less information needs to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library crew.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA has allowed it to rip school children from school districts.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed betting, especially angled investor.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent another investigator into the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as an African minister to buy suspicious money in the US to buy a home, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that everyone would make suggestions to a lawyer from our investigators, how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course, nobody was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has underspread our playful investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politicians, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very strange, as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I see quite that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen clashes on more transparency, affecting the owners of firms.</seg>
<seg id="86">Political attention was found by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who really stands behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have taken a draft bill in both parliament chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure in the United States and global for greater transparency.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are mad if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy that arise and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end through laws this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the Intransparency, which now allows for this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost abducted and in the boot of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing even worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just met him only! he said he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to be back in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air bed. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Er, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">In the night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I broken out there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, on the toe of the door to the door, and my sleeping door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me today depends on his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people, who were sold to me in childhood, were actually friends who were waiting only to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air bed, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let us make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I knew how we could earn something. our apartment will stay with a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air matratze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were able to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wood floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese ham elettes tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door to the castle, Brian and I joined us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a web site, on which people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their baths -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">You can then invite a strange person over the Internet, to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket was lit.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still throughout consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learnt to children, strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When one has a problem, one gets on the things you can do well. we could designate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create great confidence, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust in design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste, which degree confidence we stripped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up, if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet destination of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, you can see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel, if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">But who actually has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell Twitter that he is the president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first imagined once with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations, they all say: "he can really stick out very well-spersed mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to give your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well-known feedback system strengthens trust significantly.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative payments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were handed over before we asked them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are in terms of age and home.</seg>
<seg id="178">Surprisingly, we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less trust we.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social default.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation seek out similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you can buy.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell too little about how "Hi!," you do not get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">One tells too much how to say, "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is also not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree to openness, such as "Great Artwork in your apartment! I'm making a holiday with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to make design create that degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write to something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With which we hadn't reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The shop is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times even if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unpermitted, celebrated parties or have been devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront, when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it's hurt when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that heareth in the voice of the Anrufer, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Thankfully, there had only a problem of 123 million nights only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonder can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel who save life, even though they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive a hospital in your own car, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay one even longer, without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not everyone runs off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I met this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of the particles fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now just call the "rent industry" it is not just to be justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of himself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What would be, however, if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a group there, to have a thoroughly complete and one in a bar crawl quarter, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you can cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments of reason to be shared?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have received the thoughts of shared shared?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities, which allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and loss.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">We were now offering habour. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">People were conveyed to people whose children were moved. they were incubators-programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. today, more than our platform will be 785 000 people in 191 countries with a foreigner or even hosts.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be so crazy about how it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality gave it already before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites already.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the review of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome prooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think that's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it whenever a red Mazda is passing away on me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had such a great impact, I wonder what we can utilize design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, undergone a cerebral underwear, a terrorist act?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus, the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met some Muslims: it is great you know.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A sewers-fitness-fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to carry the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">My Feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing: at that time it was a feminist independence of independence, on the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to me a perfect and unattachable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought after, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion to deepen themselves with each of the corans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm brings me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, and yet love you?</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineers.</seg>
<seg id="289">I later, after my marriage, a child, and was basically the "Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then there was a terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, looking at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word "Breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"" "I switched to the TV channel and heard:..." ""... "Muslim" ""... "..." ""... "from the name of Islam..." ""... "..." ""... "..." ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country has been attacked, but in the Nu, the deeds of others from another cident in a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Middle East in the USA to move into a new city and start in the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I left -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "Be careful," "" "blew in well lit areas," "" "Don't touch you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">It was then Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims are gathered to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">And again the warnings: "not on this first friday, the mosque could be a target."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably well, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or of those who stood for Muslims in the Free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really branding on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt untrue.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who have attacked this land, attacked our land.</seg>
<seg id="315">I pushed the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain to yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">There are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today, we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventor and teacher, Sustainer and Olympic Risks.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be some parking, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to study people of other faith, and show greater civil participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it is determined that it begins online. as a first person, the person is cut off from her church, so that the person believes that the person believes that the people abhors the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and their ideology, is a traitor or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to stop radicalisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still maintain that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS founded their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you take a look at them, they don't drive what they lases in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which they can read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">A remarkable imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they thought to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every mind that she spoke to silence, she said to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, she only would bring into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had given its anger sense, it was a main goal for the instrument by extremists who spoke to her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection to God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Rather than accuse them for their anger, he showed a constructive path for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as the Islamophobia and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does ordinary Americans work out?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption increase every day on our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientist studies -- show: if we fear ourselves, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept a authorized government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if one report reviews, in which negative on Muslims were reported, they voted in rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood swapping Muslims to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two periodic periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manifest to the public to eliminate the foundation of a free society, the rational and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning signs.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear makes us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective innocence, it is not only about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, most generous human being, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did a young man become a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne on her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment as with a execution when he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He flowed eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanatismus cannot only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about to leave America we to our children: one that would control us through fear, or, in which we can practice our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">We drove up with our son in the children's seat, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and took my shoes, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked, and welcomed our guests, because the half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to attack us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment, I have broken together.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had taken courage and compassion, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go for sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or if you join them that mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks a lot!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say that you think you're holding a TEDTalk, a monument with depth are to work in a noble reasoning, i.e. an exception, and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say you don't fool. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I'm not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I usually am as usual.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did this with the greatest ever-led study to Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people appear as an exception to rule, often the rule is broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler began to become a billionstore just before.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air putations entered into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built live in front of an audience of six meters high tower in France. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting connecting air conditioning high speed and acceleration in tight space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build a self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, to deal with turbulence and react in general in nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possibilites in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to operate an autonomous system, it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, calculations put on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at highest levels. for example," "" "Start" "" "and" "" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starring fisherman, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can hover, and has great benefits at start and landing, and is very diverse.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear stern is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind balls.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aviation device doesn't matter what is able to recover the optimal position and improve performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions leading to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that will be met for you to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Before decades ago, skilled pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft, which only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanical simplest control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">There is only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross-rusters, no further actuators or control surfaces, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although mechanically is simple, inside the interior lives a lot, so that it can fly stable, and move around in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedgecutter. to bring it to fly, I must throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it right when I see all, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in genomelty, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propeller, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space to move in all directions, no matter what direction he is filmed or even like it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight "Propeller."</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is conceivable in models, the rest is learnt directly to fly.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">It turns clockwise in clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller strikes out, the electronics or a battery -- can fly to the machine if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that, making a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was investigated synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit it with local technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, motivate these demonstrations to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine, there is a flying lamp screen on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us the reward is in the development and the creation act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creature allowed to form it so spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant Galaxy, two black holes were moved in a very far away, so the mass of three sun sets in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they brightened brighter than all stars in all galaxies of all the familiar universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy was not set free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time tissue and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Then we arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, the world had just emerged on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stand upon us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">Around 25 years ago I decided to build a group of especially brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which arise about colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as a crazy geniuses so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the Laser-Interferometry Gravity Observatory Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was considerably increased, which significantly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">So you call him Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final trial run by some smaller, hard-minded problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes passed through the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector itself.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my father-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this for what I've been working is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he studied gravitational-waves of black holes and their observatories as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational hafts?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a cudation in the bottom of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">During the passing of the wave, space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and turns into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers lead to the Relativity Theory often a properly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each one was stretched out by us when the waves was stretched out and the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. this, one explained the ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer long laser detector, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandths of a nuclear point. that's grotesk.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in construction of such detectors are massive.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finalist, and with the support of the public, all barriers will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Return to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo was more than one eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. because so you can create a picture or a map of things, by touching the coming of several points next light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult to make a picture of things that make you very much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to specific features such as pitch and -height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make them simple images of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear the all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation of a lifeless can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been working very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, you can hear the same circuit with an additional sound change. it sounds like that: Wu-wu-wu-wu wu wu:</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement of motion, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date which at least I never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender noise] YSH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass that are around as fast as the rods of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: just think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 sonns, the other with a mass of 36 sun, revolve each one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebes a whole new way to explore the universe as it never was possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way, we can listen to all the sounds and the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">All in all, we can't see -- practical or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about the space.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see, as this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitation-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the prick: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the prick is covered with his own replica.</seg>
<seg id="541">Through gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen all things that we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea. things we are only discovering by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things just in the first run of things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this issue: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo makes us an entirely different perspective on events in all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately to look forward as we came out of this mayhem.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build a glorious detectors and listen to the cosmos and chirp of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatory -- a completely new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the original?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year long I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of which I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it felt nervous, taught me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "Yes" to me.</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on television live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I like to start playing with the foam?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a mad thing happened: exactly what to do when I was afraid, frightened my fears.</seg>
<seg id="564">I'm afraid to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"" "but there was a certain" "" "Yes, that changed my life." "" "it started with a question of my youngest." ""</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, called for unexplained reasons all the "Schittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">She would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "cookies, I need milk for my snorkeling." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She was wondering if I could play with her when I was just on the jump. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I swam to play with them whenever you call me. no matter what I'm going to do, or where I go, I say always Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I wearied myself very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But there was also an amazing side effect: only recently I was completely misunderstood that "yes" -Sort saved my career with my children.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a author. I think things off, stir up your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I have television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I'm responsible for responsible for 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every programme offers hundreds of jobs that are not existing before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which simultaneously in production are four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run back on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">Across the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obtainable. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn round the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, that is why I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who are so hard working as if you are using a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously, so you understand that I'm not only looking around the computer, and it's true, when I say: I understand that at a dream job is not about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat - no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I feel in work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a dream, you make a marathon, they delivered a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and maternal, clinically and spiritually, cruel and rational. and the best thing about it is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begin in my head, and it is growing and growing, and the sums listen like a busy street, I could go for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I explaining the sums that I am writing about writing that the letter is ready for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I started working with TV production, when I started working and work and work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you can't strive differently than to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not differently to strive to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it is also a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not doing for failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to say to you, I am a titanium, and I know I don't want it to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">To be clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work more, the more work at the same time, the more in the same time, the more you write history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country, which I run, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Worked, revised, exaggerated, burned down.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their Mama is a single working class.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my Nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says: "cookies, I want to go to Shonda-land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titles.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, processed weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium doesn't sleep, don't exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me, silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when doing what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">I know some of them think: "grasl you out, the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you are doing what you are doing, one loves to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love one another and that's like the sums, when the sums stops when the sums stops, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-state-waitress" poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way to the outside, it's late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "firstly, I have to say" "" "Yes," "" "and secondly, she called me not" "" "kitten" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls nobody "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When will this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am titanium and my sums, and everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "Mom, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">That is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and play their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and lack of money, I can do nothing but to miss.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they don't exist anymore.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, waxes and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Die Ice Queen" lets you get rid of.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and a Energieschub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is here.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the workhorse, the titanium dioxide, that is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I say to you, who I am I describe using my brain, and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not force, and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The genuine sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the river that comes from the life of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The genuine sums is self consciousness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The genuine sums ignores the pressure of history, which anticipates experience, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a firm rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is a law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">They don't play ansattwise as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurt,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer more than home at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This entry is painful, for what a man would rather than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed, none of them is.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I mainly feel stiff, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attacker to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me for naive, for a day dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones would like to play at the most 15 minutes with me until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladle or biscuit replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my Teenie-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more needs it not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can bring about 15 minutes each, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes at play!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are finished.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my welfare, my world. it must not be the children. it is to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'm shy and I victories. friends meet, read books that enjoy day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to pass more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums then seems to return, if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without any games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, they complies with me and my soul. they lead me into new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums isn't I... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">Now that is my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">"" "I said," "" "Yes" "" "too much work and to play." ""</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in handle. my brain is yet functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I run, the troops, the wall walls, the high tone, the sums, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums feel, the more makes this unusual, lasting, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel that sums feel, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a author. I think things off, I would raise you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, that means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from a second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system the patients often have permanent, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">For sure they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "deep-brain-stimulation." this is implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe citrus and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was Senior Physician and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that brain-brain traumata increases the brain and increases the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, it is necessary to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To make up cells of a tissue, comparable to small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the correct food, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive it.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean François Hollande made it.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did a further fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellpopulation that looked like stem cells but was different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the Fötus stage, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from non-linguistic area and then mix the cells exactly as cultivated, as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then, colourless, to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted them at the exception of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in a precaried brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were completely disappeared after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells, and now, the cells remained -- they came up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells we colored in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey, to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take food pellets for one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable skill level, we did last in the motic cortex to the hand motor skills area.</seg>
<seg id="869">So the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, it recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastily brain mechanisms. it recuperate to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance in front of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after Reimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and then use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathology models, for example in Parkinson's.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still, however, to implant them to people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope to show you soon, as the human brain has the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do this."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely get there.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, one needs about two kilograms of papers and forms out to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it will take until someone can get to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It already needs a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the West, we make a big mistake, as of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We don't see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality, but as inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchangeable geopenness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing have definitely proven that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy vanishes in us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was told me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- did not affect the austerity schemes that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my receptionist friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I want to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in, together with me, that Lee Kuan Yew, Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our societies are formed, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I want to point you to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain which throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his rdymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious, however, is to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one might maintain the debt mountain and could also produce all the things that mankind is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the United States, in England and the euro zone, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, galley, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion U.S. dollars will sound a lot of money until you compare it to the same time in the same countries and financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did if the stock exchanges and the real estate prices are high.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit that do not correspond with the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the United States, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently, a low demand for the pessimism of investors, which could not invest in which it might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Inwarmed the circumstances that causes oil to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my Hades with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His most extravagant Art. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve human talents, and develop particularly all the technologies, "green" technologies that are key to salvation of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy than the form of form in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the job worth of athenian democracy due to these connections.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that she gave the working poor, and not only the right to free expression, but more important and crucial, which she admitted them the right to political participation with the same mood in questions of the state of state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been kept long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that is very bright, it is also burned down quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies have not their roots in an ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came up when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was renounced on politics, while the economy -- so the world of the corporations -- a democratised zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the time since the separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two took place by the economy gradually migratory politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government today and nevertheless not in power, because the power of politics is waved into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haveins with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is in about as a herd of robbery, who nourishes the animals, of which it nourishes, decimated that it is starved in the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is similar to the economy that has so far cannibalized by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political property is devaluation, the inequality is falling, and the managing director of the corporations are anxious to invest the cash of their enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="948">The successful capitalism distributes the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twins peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour and the welfare of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that's true, it's obvious that we have to bring the policy and economy again, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">That's not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and was not particularly well done.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor will only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolishing the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does, taking out low-cost workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separated, the automation of the twin summit will be higher, the waste generated, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reshape the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and thereby paying attention to the reunited area, otherwise we would like to appear in a disease monitoring hyperautocratie, which makes the film "Matrix" as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not, whether capitalism has caused the technical accomplishments he will survive.</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism are replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of society in "Star Trek," in the machines that serve people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians, or in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So how could it look like this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I want to give you, in all coming soon, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please ask a capital market where you are working and in which your capital is working on you from a job site to the next, and the company -- no matter what you're currently working -- is the property of those who work currently in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues originate and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">There are no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they are not involved in it, and employees working there in which the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and sparar, and ultimately no emporal twins peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: just imagine that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging economies], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment means are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">This is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that, at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in front of the background of a reunited policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is simultaneously liberating, in which they prefer privileged persons, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we get in a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to take political together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a libertary Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, is Marx relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do not do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which Larry Summers as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transfer of this crisis of a part of Earth to the next one, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I'm a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I'm completely invertebrazed.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the speakers of the Redner, you said clearly what you'll keep from the West's perspective on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the time plays, -- the area of the economy -- an entirely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, when I may say that this is the provocative, China is similar to the Great Britain of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- do you remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically viewed.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical, regarding the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China now, is very similar to the development we had in England throughout the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now attempting to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, is smoothed to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I realized that this happens.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the complacency, and the digestible failure to say that a massive intermediation line passed through the Eurozone, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek accusation -- by the way, the first suggestion was to be revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It's right to make it right. unfortunately, the powers in the eurozone, within the European group, continued to deny denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you attempt to get an economic system that is not able to obtain life through political will and author itarianism, it will perhaps be delayed until a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see beforehand?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone won't have a future if we do not change their setup.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a decent situation, claimed that he did not have mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt relief program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the pages of the money makers to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government to fall, just because they didn't want to deal with those who were displeased by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one from the Troika's Troika, imposed on this policy, confessed: "this was a colossaler mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all these, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the Eurozone won't survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the centered fliers will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"" "" "" "if we suggest to suggest the way of a post-modern 1930 that it appears to me, it will be as well to be the future of Europeans and non-Europeans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard the most yet, although it is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is ducing employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a yellow cure and describes on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose anything.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are located right on this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation works from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that you are addicted, where, after one has looked a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should be enough to tell you what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I don't need special intelligence to accommodate" "" "toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He turns out more thoughts on the mean extermination, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something like this, that's why Roy Price wants to riser nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online, where it can look for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is for free stuff, you access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are watched at the watching of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are watched by Roy and his team to record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture, when you start the show, when you paused, which parts are skipped and check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon was to make a Sitcom through four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landing at 7,5 -- so something above the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super-show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of taking a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course they like shows, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows them, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this Show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" get a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">Two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many dates and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data, it is a decision to meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The worst thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis is not working so, this is a bit scary, because we live in a time we are going to make more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software. come in contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone asks here in the United States in prison and ask for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is performed or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not that a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data are also sealed by companies.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009 Google announced that through data analysis algorithms from flu, the worse kind, you can say, by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news coverage. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked immaculate, year around the year, until it didn't work suddenly,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the release of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data are sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data emissed in decisions of life - at work, in the legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So, we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly have two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">When employing this problem in its parts, you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, you put the components back together to put a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just fine for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put together the parts together and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is possible to summarize parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, so it is especially when the brain is an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience if they were otherwise unable to have. but the decision to put together all these parts and make it a show like "House of Cards" that doesn't stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that she went into a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, however, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV-ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision, because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices, but I think things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order to forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" Magic "" "" Magic 8 Ball, "" "." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "" "" most likely "" "" right here at this moment. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will later interpret it later with a demo-demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have so far met some decisions in my life, with what I would have to listen to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. finally, it's up to meet decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I received this as a very heartifying message that despite the great amount of data is still going out to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing, and risks to go.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks in which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks a lot.</seg>
