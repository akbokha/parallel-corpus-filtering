Munich 1856 : four maps that change your glance into the city
an Irish @-@ institution , where young people are to meet today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small hus@@ band@@ men manage the infl@@ amed reason of peasants .
the oldest official map Mün@@ che promotes exciting stories to days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not up to date .
everyone knows who had to be exciting , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i held a green meadow instead of a stra@@ y road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in Bavaria of state government , are all other than currently - but just therefore very elabor@@ ate .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
it is then clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a b@@ ent@@ ine carpet , which one can not recognize as such .
in the great transition card , for cities and municipalities were more detailed maps , so called judgments , and so on .
these were developed according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns .
your Client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French army of Army occupied Bavaria within the Second World War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted a review about the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops entered the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 , they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ map .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Authority .
the judgments of Munich , dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of fruit / today is the most impressive example of the capital &apos;s capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is under@@ gone , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was built for 21 years after the map , thus 1877 , the Munich district .
today , sau@@ cer is in the middle of the city .
the houses of the signat@@ ories are focused on today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers &apos; uprising against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , you can see nothing as fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ ein@@ zo@@ oming appears a small @-@ piece card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ s &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
little plots there are no farmers anymore - but small gar@@ dener in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area distingu@@ ishes itself north of the fore@@ ver@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 Place of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete waste .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the jud@@ ging of the journal Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the pitch &quot; at the fan &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once again locked people with mad@@ missions .
in 1858 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ vine was created &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders . &quot;
in 1872 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the establishment of this psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was most advanced for his time and ended the chains of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the staff to turn violence against the passengers , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients had first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county road in hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
there are now young people living in Munich in Munich on the area of the former Au@@ er institution .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and turned it into a youth hostel with training .
situated to the west of the TS@@ V Munich East , east @-@ east of the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - in architectural design to the origin of the Ir@@ vine , which had been destroyed during the Second World War .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; Head square &quot; in 1856 , the purchase of the department named &quot; Kauf@@ inger Lane . &quot;
a decisive change carried out the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies broke out in December 1944 , and many holes in the city center .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel in the Middle Ages were once again at the Mari@@ enhof at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days take place on 5 April 2017 on the ground @-@ breaking ground for the second S @-@ Bahn circuit .
you can compare the old Munich map with the air image of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof hole .
civil rights agreement publishes travel warning for Mis@@ souri
the National Association for promoting Far@@ ties has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks by the State of Mis@@ souri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the State of Mis@@ souri , which is scheduled for August 28 , 2017 , demands af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to travel through the state as a number of frag@@ ile , racial abuse during the last time in the entire State , and stated here , &quot; says it &apos;s in the opinion of the Group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people harder to win discrimin@@ ating criminal matters , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , promp@@ ted the group to release the it@@ iner@@ ary , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have violations of the civil rights to happen to humans .
they will be stopped due to their skin color , they are defeated or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances of the beginning of the year after having no gasoline had taken a petrol and taken by the police by Mis@@ souri by the State of Mis@@ souri .
the Council also refers to a recent report on the Office of the Mis@@ souri &quot; Office , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff , inform us what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring Cau@@ tious money or their relatives to travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 Hass@@ elt in the year 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s anti @-@ crime fiction program , which caused the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
the it@@ iner@@ ary is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for living or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the states agreed to arrest the local criminal prosecution , to arrest people due to immigration laws , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further carcin@@ ogens .
travel war@@ nings will usually be issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence is elementary
the fishing b@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue throughout the coming year .
the CD@@ U Parliamentary Group , Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have taken a picture in front of them .
at the Rec@@ ru@@ yard of the family Schwen@@ demann met together representatives of the fishing b@@ acher CD@@ U @-@ Res@@ ands together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs .
Markus Schwen@@ demann first best@@ ows some insight into his operation , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods , 40 cows dairy cows , as well as many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses in five apartments .
the &quot; Black Forest &quot; milk is for him the alternative mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ n@@ demann .
in the table of the Feri@@ a comes exclusively regional .
since he is also called BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; elem@@ ental important . &quot;
I can not win on der@@ type steep areas .
the green space is for a lot of work , and much must be edited with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been talking here with the terms and the top@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the el@@ eventh operation and management this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even though it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the meaning of the dec@@ ep@@ tive project and is glad about the leader . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you hope that the request of the surfaces could be pulled out for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and doing thoughts as they continue to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised the Mayor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmers are often in criticism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the open surface area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be stopped by at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 Euro , half of leader was promoted , and a quarter contributed to the community &apos;s fishing community .
thus , farmers love 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of turn@@ outs .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a good job , without farmers and land women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land@@ scap@@ ing fle@@ x@@ ger@@ ie ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state support of women f@@ ences .
the aim is the dis@@ closure of the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded convey@@ ors .
in addition , the enclosure may not be worse ( slope above 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by acceptance .
the motion of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence in 2018 for the fishing b@@ acher Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ fence 2018 .
the open space is equivalent to 35 hectares , the cost @-@ calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans also appreciate these , like any other - hence the sor@@ rows @-@ staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologist of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly did what he did when he had a symbolic ax@@ e in a hot conflict with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN , regarding the suggestions of President to dr@@ astic change of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of poss@@ essions and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have sm@@ yn@@ ched him if he had done it .
but he touched their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller chose A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that makes the world enligh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem , which you refer to , later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller lies objec@@ tively correct , but as he form@@ ulated himself , it is not really about history .
it &apos;s about the contemp@@ or@@ tive words of Lazarus , the only ones who invites one state not only any old immig@@ rant , but the poor of the poor : &quot; your garbage , your poor , / your th@@ ron@@ ged masses , which are lon@@ ging to breathe freely , the el@@ bows of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ eventh apost@@ asy &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they did a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans by presenting the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in an un@@ used classic .
Lazarus changed these importance : in their poem , the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this back to the right wing .
the Great Schre@@ ih@@ as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , the American flame was moving into the world : &quot; lady Liberty is moving forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way into the United States . &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh has been quite un@@ common here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they saw from the exhausted , ending , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and make a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .
and this is , of course , not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to recognize .
her tor@@ ch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power to ign@@ ite .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schot@@ t belonged to the team of Great Britain
the performance of the athle@@ tics of the UK , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship title &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland she has developed something special , and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ .de - which was elected to Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Doyle was elected by the team &apos;s team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
their chapter speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or who , wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie came quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth silver medal winner , which will compete at its fifth world championships for the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; incredibly &quot; that 16 Schot@@ t are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another piece that is to be observed after a great season , which was the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
he remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team capit@@ als says that they are &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also in the medals and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are so special about team capit@@ als that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and voted for me , it will be something very special for me &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Schot@@ t that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb up po@@ di@@ ums .
what my speech den@@ ies as cap@@ turing ?
yes , I think it was good .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , since we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to get to this home support and benefit that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and there &apos;s just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t throw yourself to a public office if you do not toler@@ ate the voters of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it wasn &apos;t long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the Domestic Policy to his political principles .
he hur@@ ried at criticism , safe .
but he did not put his critics into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b , we will lead the sheep to the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to read Larry H@@ og@@ an , who needs to work more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan@@ s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained that this week .
the Govern@@ ors &quot; headquarters sent the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a return reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the nation &apos;s 50 govern@@ ors .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as a primary means to join with his voters and play his hair@@ less head on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who are on the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially called and of employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post defended Ho@@ gan@@ s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the comments of the comments are nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too simple to use the image of lead or mo@@ ver or water @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the Post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said their comments resp@@ ect@@ fully , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest ren@@ ounced the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan@@ s Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , MD , was not fulfilled , but she asked for Hass@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the comment field of news &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like that idea if a number of people is on the same subject , then they will be dis@@ regarded by some more than a so @-@ called collective deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the employees of the Govern@@ ors described as &quot; concentrated spam attack , &quot; would probably call &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot;
the fac@@ ebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors , to burn and bring prot@@ esters to arrest or silence .
but exactly that is happening digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials who critic@@ ises that he has chosen Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is lam@@ ented by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question came in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the last A@@ vent@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers showed up between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat on his guidance .
and even at that time , Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers , the Washington decisions .
petitions , who critic@@ ise his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade , and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the George Washington Project .
but he did not put her into silence .
freedom of expression , opinion , and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of domestic comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links next year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , has been associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founding and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he reached his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great state .
Jerry made a great job when he established this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great window for this course . &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career with both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really feels particularly well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura open , as it was won in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back from last year , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year to win here .
it was a really special time and one that we ever appreciated . &quot;
Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour in the year earlier this year , returns to the campaign back home .
this event will be the first Scottish appearance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio on the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish .
OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Schot@@ t in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
entrance fee is free of charge , the parking lot is £ 5 a car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passi@@ v@@ smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died due to passive smoking on lung cancer .
researchers at the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are based on this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , in 167 lung cancer is due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kal@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up a study on this issue of 1994 .
there was still 400 lung cancer in Germany because of passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
hou@@ sings are considered very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are more reason@@ ably in time , &quot; so the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i is cooked , she uses no cooker .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the P@@ ani@@ ai regim@@ en in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife normally puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour the coated Kn@@ olls is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where she also conduc@@ ts her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space is served as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , you were not assigned to the fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work is dangerous : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers .
&quot; no one dare to walk around the village after 17 : 00 , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life of Papua New Zealand of Papua New Dutch colony that was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , established for independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and foreign journalists or legal notice .
in 2003 the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , with an independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so sec@@ lu@@ ded as it is desolate . the trip involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning car ride with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo trees , and from cor@@ ru@@ gated residential buildings , converted by r@@ ust into various yellow brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esians have made their journey here , trained journalists and practically no fore@@ ig@@ ner .
before Christian mission@@ aries came , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans was a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skir@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Papua New Guinea &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality rates and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from P@@ ani@@ ai , a high land provincial in the size of New Jersey , with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort is min@@ ed by 3.1 billion US dollars in gold and copper alone .
furthermore , Papua New assets also has an estimated $ 78 billion dollars .
however , this wealth , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for Papua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military maintains a cho@@ ke presence .
an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort &apos;s local military troops and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 USD a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands thre@@ aten these golden char@@ ds and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s main land in the 1970 @-@ 1970s have been used to commit genocide according to the Asia Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in a report of the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are , like some illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric env@@ elop@@ es are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week inci@@ dents , &quot; Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce an influ@@ x of settlements from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes , since Muslim economic mig@@ rant come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .

the Indonesian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in Volk@@ sm@@ und and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal rights violations in Papua New Year 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter was a total of 29 members of Papua New District including P@@ ani@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i with the expec@@ tation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , P@@ ani@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ on@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took a violation of her clay , and returned later with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and killed the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired up in the group of children .
a child who was 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things settled on the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to challenge justice .
they wore cereb@@ ral hunting grounds and carried the orph@@ ita dance - in circle continuously and a bird @-@ singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones to police and military posts .
when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers was sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says in an official document of TIM@@ E that the local media has not been released .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatened danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left hand , &quot; he said TIM@@ E at the porch of his colorful wood house .
kay@@ ak still don &apos;t know who &apos;s fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native guy Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his cousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and sought his body to be sure that he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es said how many Indon@@ esians bear only one name , the TIM@@ E in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Che@@ ese spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to back only &quot; back &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
the messages over the kill@@ ings came first &apos; filmed &apos; to Jak@@ arta in the following day .
in three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims , and gay , the historical ass@@ ail@@ ments in Papua New Zealand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case immediately resolved to be solved immediately , so it will not happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Minister for the Security Minister Wir@@ anto granted him an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations .
but the expressions started almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &quot; s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that have to pass through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke at Jak@@ arta on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua New complaint .
instead , &quot; everything will be regulated by law , &quot; he said .
Wir@@ anto , accused the UN because of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 death toll in East Tim@@ or of the independence of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua New Zealand have been settled , including the P@@ ani@@ ai incident .
the families of P@@ ani@@ ai victims took to meet these claims with Gri@@ mm@@ ab@@ norm@@ alities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I interviewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in P@@ ani@@ ai worried about discussing the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the shooting have not stopped .
on Tuesday the ind@@ on@@ esian police took place on vill@@ agers in P@@ ani@@ ais neighbourhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man into the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ viol@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he conf@@ isc@@ ated in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
tra@@ ded vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted on it , fired warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( ind@@ on@@ esian paramil@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killing a killing .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the last one has been delivered quickly , the TIM@@ E .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the officers to account and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
P@@ ani@@ ai was always an accident with the Indonesian government .
lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua live .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of Papua New by using spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of the Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ top leaders come from P@@ ani@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to thousands of people in P@@ ani@@ ai , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never appear again .
among the people in Papua New P@@ ani@@ ai , known as &quot; a portable , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ ion and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
you retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a are only 10,000 ind@@ on@@ esian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and new migrants who have arrived in a larger number since the re @-@ opening of the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and weal@@ thy immigrants .
Papua have seldom the capital or the necessary skills to lead their own business competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the P@@ ani@@ ai tribe .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
moreover , limitations of reporting international media remain anxi@@ ous .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle &apos;s Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they had been given the rare permission to travel .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaigns were to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia un@@ quiet provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : Visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widely used injuries &quot; in Papua New P@@ ani@@ ai firing .
the same countries historically have seen the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r reported the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still is a democratic system , and there is free media so it is difficult to temp@@ t the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
people want to know more foreign governments to know this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of Human Right @-@ Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura set up their silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that would also be part of the session , but anonymous .
Indonesia lost a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the P@@ ani@@ ai jack@@ ets , &quot; G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe committee .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , besides that it is under the constant threat of a common military , is located in poor educational and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the P@@ ani@@ ai people , like other Papua , must consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; he must pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they just want righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats of threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of P@@ ani@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ el carried a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the loan of a victim was buried on a terrain right across the police and the military station .
they know that they might ever get justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget the responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with direct head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per of Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in Dubai in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents out of the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ rise building , which is called random to the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were no reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of flame .
&quot; we slept and we have stood at the fire@@ alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor down , &quot; told a inhabitants who named his name as George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) are extingu@@ ished and cooling down the building .
the government said they work in the provision of self @-@ catering for the affected people .
the incident may benefit from the safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages caused by the disgu@@ ise , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of records for isolation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which approximately 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is with his major Davis Cup Cou@@ p through the general meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary suggestion was to play for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets , Hau@@ ch@@ thin@@ ker does not support the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact often very long , but that &apos;s why the estimated five @-@ sentence classics have been preserved with the traditional value .
6@@ 3.9 percent of the Member States voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ kon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work , to improve the values .
not until the vote , after the vote , the proposal occurred to fill the finals at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will continue to be host in the first round in the first round .
to reduce the costs of the organis@@ er , the requirements in terms of training courses are facil@@ it@@ ates and the players are going to complete less official media events prior to Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 passengers , prohibited items into the plane , finds out a survey
a survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20 per cent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items in the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration are s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled , including at least 6 percent that entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally contributed or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had delayed late to be mistak@@ enly from fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 persons - who was conducted by a Jet @-@ charter service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
the respondents said that they have tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 per cent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that have been deliberately led to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated that they have carried out objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirm that they had deliberately brought drugs into the plane .
the company said , I questioned trav@@ ellers across the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had taken mu@@ g@@ gled out@@ war@@ med goods by the airport security and how many things had done fool@@ ish@@ ly .
it is no surprise that people who wear s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - know@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company demonstrates that the T@@ SA rules have a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain , what liquids they may take away or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the biggest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ isc@@ ated items would be prohibited for liquids .
for a long time , the people who T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel the Order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k are pleased with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he has already signed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ committ@@ al reservation .
in addition to the always th@@ under@@ ous figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k also revealed another , less gloss@@ y number for the first time : the cancell@@ ations made on the new mass market @-@ model 3 .
in the past months , Mus@@ k was frequently advertis@@ ed with over 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extradition begins right now .
now , Mus@@ k was a : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations , 6@@ 3.000 has already been withdrawn again .
critics always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ committ@@ al reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) .
45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ committ@@ al reservations before , spatial Mus@@ k at a telephone conference with analysts agree .
however , no more than twelve percent of all orders have to be encountered , the Tesla boss believes not .
its argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth target is not in demand , but on the production site .
Tesla got 8@@ 4,000 cars last year .
2018 - all models are to be taken together - 500,000 , by 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , we arrive in 1800 reservations per day .
who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; may be expected at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla creates it , its brand new , never in practice tested production roads without greater rup@@ tions with maximum charging .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the non @-@ committ@@ ment of the reservations could be a problem for Tesla .
because then , the company cannot be dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been dra@@ fted by 15 States , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , took off his earlier decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to be the needs of state environmental regulatory authorities more quickly than previous administ@@ rations .
he did not prosec@@ ute the law@@ suit against his prior position in a Federal Appe@@ als Court .
it &apos;s about a time limit which ran for states on 1 October in order to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ floor o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would not hesitate to spend more time in order to study the plan to study the plan and to avoid &quot; change in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of Oklahoma , was a long time a reliable opponent of more demanding environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been repe@@ ating , to block regul@@ ators , or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ bies regulatory agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator tried its authority to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ cks .
in a statement on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ ing for the EPA for cooperation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards .
&quot; in previous administ@@ rations , the EPA has often considered the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then have been waiting to be accused by activists and others , and in an agreement establishing the appointment for carrying out , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t believe in regulation with judicial proceedings , and we take Fri@@ sten serious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that there is to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the opinion of the EPA reported that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually use his &quot; satisfaction to delay and all other legally available , &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans push for a bro@@ ader new version of the o@@ zone rules .
in the final month of approval , the draft rules should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not been submitted to vote in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States , introduced the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our Kl@@ agen@@ das - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flow to their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sylv@@ anian , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .

tur@@ ists celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery @-@ A@@ real in Tum@@ ors on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm at a seren@@ ade .
whether his idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and supp@@ orter of tum@@ ours to their inten@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ ous Klein@@ od . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ical Certific@@ ate : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the protest@@ ant parish church together with the V@@ og@@ party in Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the certificate according to the document , on the Tum@@ our mountain apart from the parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , which belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , in addition to the Lower village and Ober@@ dorf , today , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the scenic settlements of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 parti@@ tions this historical figures .
the patron Law originated from the early medieval owner @-@ law .
a lord who built a church built himself and occupied with a priest , remains the owner of this church , and could also inherit it .
this was the right to insert a priest or to propose a new priest .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two broken down to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rings for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window frames were stolen and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was in@@ den@@ sely .
1796 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed close to the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and ch@@ urch@@ ins , and used them as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead of Hör@@ n@@ wel@@ der .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Church was demol@@ ished .
only the steep@@ le were left .
in the New Year 1834 , a storm split storm storm and half collapsed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted .
only the tower still existing today remained the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em care of the &quot; creative sen@@ ators &quot; as a successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant .
as an organizer , friends and sponsors of the Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , at the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery for the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo &apos;s Com@@ bo @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 a.m .

&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows down to the woods , &quot; the organis@@ ers make the fantastic view out .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters to obtain the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ours and hearing @-@ silent .
the friends and sponsors of the tum@@ ors feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer , Walter Martin@@ i .
Society wants to test permission of wind@@ bikes
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are wor@@ shi@@ ped &quot; no legal requirement for the construction and has so far turned to the coun@@ sell@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are called &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) , promp@@ ted its approval for construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval of 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in four , only at the border border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal existed a wind force @-@ concentrate zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy plants are basically possible , the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the area .
various zones are to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
the town of Vier@@ sen had decided a few days earlier through a change in the area of stream in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but , however , the District government in Düsseldorf didn &apos;t appro@@ ve for a defect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning evaluation , the approval decision is to be un@@ lawful and therefore rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim are worshipped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of things : the city council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an auth@@ orization of the District government is still standing .
Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this section the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind energy plants is excluded . &quot;
the circle corro@@ bor@@ ates the receipt of ar@@ rest@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the last week , the corresponding letter has been entered at the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on occasion to consider the matter again .
they are likely to lead , however , that the procedure is stopped .
with a view on current proceedings at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday could not be subject to the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four each 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen is involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , has closed off oc@@ curren@@ ces with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the power consumption of around 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to around one @-@ fifth of all four@@ ths of electricity needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in summer , there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ nich near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the circle of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cra@@ cks together : woman die with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has happened on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Lower Wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was injured .
two more people were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
after police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich passed with her car as part of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and distributors plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to discover the shops in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in downtown .
as the chairman of the industrial association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend spent the customer for this sensi@@ ti@@ ze , which offers its own city aside from the usual supermarket commodity .
the market is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , native firms to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre is to invite &quot; mit@@ es @-@ sh@@ opp@@ en . &quot;
this action is not only in the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , a Internet video and printed bag that point to the action weekend so Christian König .
in cooperation with the Chamber of Industry and Industry cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
this makes the commercial club and the city into another stage of the project &quot; attrac@@ tiveness downtown . &quot;
these include new offers like the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to well @-@ selling Sunday , discussions with all tra@@ ders and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customers should also be new or re@@ opened .
these include courses and tourists .
but many locals also have lost the city downtown shopping .
in the end , all of them would help to revi@@ ve the city center - to rent , to rent out the whole city and clubs .
it gel@@ ded to overcome with a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y that was partly scattered , King had said in the spring .
Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , divided that in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day , five Thür@@ inger cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ bl@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Abi@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of the local trade and its significance to the community of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under spring management of the I@@ HK and with many partners make also clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment themselves .

Tr@@ ump made by telephone calls from telephone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone conversation with the Mexican President Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President compl@@ ained him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and gay , Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first attack with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Gymn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a decent exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull is that a trade for the USA refugees trying to take over &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; foolish &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the government Obama , after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the unpleasant call for all day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Mass@@ acre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Moore .
before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and looking forward through the wind@@ shield .
inside sli@@ ps the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ ar the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scar@@ c@@ ely torn the silence , when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene is played , which was played on July 22 , only one night &apos;s order .
but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all in the audience were really real sigh@@ ing .
since 2005 , Ci@@ tiz@@ ens has come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com - and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - recorded in 1946 by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged because of the kill@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really in@@ comprehen@@ sible that in all these years no one person was arrested in all these years , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who assi@@ sts in the organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life long citizen .
it is a dramatic call for him to act as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want to heal , we want reconciliation , but first we need to receive righteousness , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t get to cure and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a judicial medi@@ ator puts a cloth on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FBI files that were received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were susp@@ ects in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free walk since decades , Ci@@ tiz@@ ens said that the twice motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions around the city was always known : Politics and sex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , the Supreme Court rendered a decision made by the Supreme Court in Georgia for the first time to complete their vote in summer campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI &apos;s FBI agent Roger Mal@@ com has a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly for a woman .
bro@@ o@@ ks said that the rum@@ our was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby , which she bore , was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she went away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge drew near , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out was Harrison who prepared the murders and ordered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , elim@@ inating evidence and del@@ ine@@ ated the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even cra@@ mp@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register , and when you vote , you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after almost a decade Cass@@ and@@ ra Gre@@ ene led the annual re@@ positioning of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , mat@@ uring and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and watch out more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that the point is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with it in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build any relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest black - into a room and lau@@ ght when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he played the role of boss C@@ lan@@ ders for years , but he said , the role will never be simpler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ bau@@ gh said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room tried the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pushed him away , anger@@ ed that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a wi@@ dert the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks down ( at least all the black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the most lou@@ der .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ ar@@ ming and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still ti@@ ch@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; have said &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ zel@@ able one of the other black perform@@ ers .
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that is exactly how the energy itself shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie will replace the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene is still beginning .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition ends non@@ violent and fast .
there is a cry , shame and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a sack@@ dress , is talking about the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Billi@@ e Holidays trau@@ matic praise &quot; Strange Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks out every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozens of viewers and tears off their eyes .
the audience is shared equally between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , arriving to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced during nearly eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tren@@ ch of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the Mor@@ de remains an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels terri@@ fic .
if the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body name .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , record fake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he recall it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a couple of minutes , gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throwing the Lyn@@ x rope away and wi@@ pe her tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit that played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a um@@ bs two of his fellow players , and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; one man whis@@ pers .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins the actors together for dinner together .
at one table , a white pair of Atlanta started thinking about the setting with a black pair , which they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which the performance has left the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do it , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does it really do with me , let me believe that the ly@@ n@@ chen still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks stays at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he was already starting to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparation is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the horror of what we have borne , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like that , if we learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Vic@@ tims of Wagner in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf reli@@ es on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous directed by gigantic , six @-@ storey back@@ drop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) , alternatively , shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a t@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; pl@@ unge &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ le@@ quin pos@@ ing as a Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or an alternative to Is@@ etta .
cap@@ sul@@ ated oil waters recall Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that draws for itself through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ ese Hagen , which surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a wei@@ ght@@ ful box .
brutal the scene when he performs Siegfried .
later it has to believe in Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) .
the audience is thanks to the ensemble with powerful applause .
Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly appe@@ aled his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
great applause is available for the Festival Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of great heat again in le@@ active leisure wear .
the band was eag@@ erly a@@ waited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had to leave the Pfei@@ f@@ Concert in 2013 and had to leave for five years later , in which the single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive res@@ ume .

with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care .
for me this was exactly the right thing which was irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : sure , here it is not about to calculate stages .
one has always left other people &apos;s head , each one another story behind .
whether a refugee , a youth who has been dra@@ gged out of the family - you always have to go individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any contact battles ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
there is a range in which there is a lot .
a lot of love , good kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .

the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure that the company was confron@@ ted .
vac@@ ancies , the Director General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced at the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 positions .

on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul .
in a position of NATO , the explosion on Thursday night is to happen when a joint pat@@ rol was attacked by the Afghan army by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Afghan army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state will be treated in the U.S. military hospital at the B@@ agra@@ m airport .

correspon@@ dents say that suicide attacks in Kabul in the last weeks has also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , its policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani .
EPA Return to the delay of Smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen um
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of Obama administration , repe@@ aled under which the states are obliged to in@@ com@@ fy the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the ped@@ ometer .
the EPA released late on Wednesday the decision to drive so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ provisions 2015 &quot; and said , she is showing the commitment to the agency to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced the intention of EPA to establish the o@@ zone regulations - in which part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions should be taken to determine where deposits must be made in order to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed an action on Tuesday , saying that an effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump tried to return a wide range of environmental reasons , former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have caused the back of demo@@ cr@@ ats and nature groups who cares about the effects of larger emissions to public health .
the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone , contains &quot; lung function , and can increase respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
common room wants a common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two other votes the Municipal Council decides to establish the establishment of a community living room in the future of Switzerland .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining land is signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ars reports .
although it still will take to date , until the church community has already been part of the community in the community , but now there is no planning of planning for a private investor to st@@ em@@ ming projects .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area of around 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the community is pending , such a common room just as a meeting point for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living area , but open to the church .
as an example the word from the &quot; swe@@ dish café &quot; made the round .
the decision is made by providing funds for the current budget already in the past autumn , by means of funding .
the building is in the restoration area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ j@@ ads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision considers to sign@@ alize the investor , that in this regard , there is no Kn@@ ü@@ ppel between the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the level of environment - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the tear @-@ height and the construction of economic power - if possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried sole , be this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the panel .
not as simple as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of his own buildings , with which one is not so wrong , but for the rest there is now at the common room of the window , &quot; says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a public participation .
she sees behind it a covered sub@@ sid@@ y on the property provisions or even foreign investors .
that &apos;s just not that , as with the acquisition of the area there is no supplement , but will get a true , in doubt @-@ market counter@@ value , the counter@@ speech is .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to pl@@ agu@@ ed orders correspon@@ d@@ ingly , finds three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two other voices at the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summar@@ ize the resolution , we make a huge ride in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an improvement in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .

in the Har@@ z of Stern hike
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Har@@ z the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned for the club observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen , since 2003 .
an &quot; star@@ path &quot; come to meet the information needs of many har@@ lot visitors .
it offers nature , science , movement and sporty performance .
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform about stars and star images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations in five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ qu@@ ire , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Brown , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets should be supple@@ mented by Internet .
this is why the location selection is a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is also a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the path path should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the star@@ path , the viewer learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star stronger than another , although he is far further away .
also , in which constellation can be found a selected star , and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain city of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in 2014 , the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to information from the Federal Office of Natural Conservation , the location is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university city there has been some simil@@ arities in the university in 2003 at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , who forms the interior of our solar system , the planet route leads up to Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the plugs with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a sphere of 6.5 mm diameter , whereas the sun measures 75 cm away , at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometres .
while the light needed by Sun to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
but the march to the next fixing , but would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia was standing in a coll@@ ision course to staged the most exciting boxing contest in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ Off@@ ices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ lag@@ ged World Bo@@ xing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , down the hall to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ alist Champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on Show@@ time , both fighters members are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 19 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
when the couple pos@@ ing for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighting is the &quot; perfect order of order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; remembered Garcia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have risen for bronze &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they require the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko then voted .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
climate review asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , a part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must be strug@@ gling with a 135 pound debut this year to be agreed in the next summer with Garcia the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell according to their lightweight @-@ weight champion in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans have asked after him , &quot; he said and pushed open later , on the network that the best financial package offers .
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever you are ready ... &quot;
Garcia said &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko , &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may be able to participate in his Saturday battle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held up with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he was thinking about the thri@@ lling champion from River@@ side , &quot; very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to co @-@ out the co @-@ off . &quot;
Garcia said the focus is to show impact strength , then boxing .
both said they could feel that moment@@ um built themselves for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighter and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tire plat@@ ter
in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously wounded on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost shortly before the front of the market , presumably after a tire plat@@ ter to control the control of its vehicle .
the passenger car went to the right in the bu@@ ckets , where he hit , and then lie down on the roof of the green strip .
four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously wounded during the accident .
during the initial support of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 toward the north was closed for approximately one hour , and subsequently the traffic on the left road ro@@ kes will pass by the accident location .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; thresh@@ ing chain works better &quot;
And@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ise the optimization of the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of season And@@ re Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as not the two opponents were in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two regions too much , and we have to watch in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the thresh@@ ing chain should also be improved .
and a gate after a free blow , the l@@ aces don &apos;t want to inv@@ ade any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be so no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better in preparation with the thresh@@ ing chain better than with the chain chain .
&quot; I do not know how we are acting in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is in his cause , &quot; because we just have in the thresh@@ ing chain to the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko G@@ ieß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; pre@@ mise is , however , that we do not harmon@@ ize even better and we can &apos;t afford a lot of ab@@ norm@@ alities in building . &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you can speak after a mis@@ ery from a bad start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could well be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and we can focus on the trop@@ hy , we will surely be able to speak of a ordinary season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season I took only after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Radio , who does not want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e , just because the game of Sax@@ on had to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; now you can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said funk and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e could possibly even be something fresh since they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion favorite in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are as lighter Favor@@ it on Sunday in the meeting ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we throw them away , just because we have the claim to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says funk , whose balance is absolutely positive at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd division that one must hit from the outs@@ et , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas in chief coach .
&quot; such statements would meet would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and that &apos;s why Funk@@ el won &apos;t experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years old . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Re@@ occur@@ ing Re@@ verse ) has begun with the execution of the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum process , after which the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for defects in evalu@@ ating the correct age of some refugees .
up to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has lost 6,@@ 880 tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases , the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency will declare that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person could possibly be under the age of 18 . &quot;
tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are permanent during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no great difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been evaluated more than 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has been lied with over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 instances that suggest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the lowest for 18 years or older was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ a@@ det searched the 5@@ 81 findings , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , used in x @-@ ray images of Wis@@ dom and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usual through the pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had a reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we can &apos;t say it certainly , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being an adult child is in@@ correct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the largest risk is in this case , if the person is just under 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ra@@ mberg are well ahead .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete road was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , manager at the Department of Traffic and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at all three sanitary @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ra@@ mberg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building site is scheduled for October and is sure that the timet@@ able is held .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ dron bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , they have come into the years now .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges leads across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of Red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge folder on Wednesday morning .
this is the edge of the boundary , which is also used as a factory road .
on Friday , the southern part of the bridge will be deployed on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge .
this is then the pedestrian walk@@ way .
the particular part is that , after finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip : the installation of leads through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires .
there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the natives were informed about the project in advance by hand@@ outs .
in addition , fish and cru@@ stac@@ eans had to be f@@ ished .
for bridges between the building and the ho@@ lies in the direction of Sch@@ ra@@ mberg , traffic is tra@@ pped through a traffic light regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher town entrance , the street is in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; .
the cost of the three frac@@ tures amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower in protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties will draw on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring to a hat .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell as a poster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and well @-@ known names on the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the event will not want to listen to the AF@@ D developers , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city @-@ pic@@ nic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz is planned , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus just before the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the forum One World and one of the decisive organizers , was really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; outstanding potato salad , which could not eat AF@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him .
the police attacked many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is just a few meters away from the locations .
how did the AF@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the AF@@ D volcanic stone , he tries to make such an event and get the supplement .

both solo@@ ists are winner and winner of numerous international competitions and have held sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is in the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra .

Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks of her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and they will eat it until the end of their life .
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Stewart quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once in grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood @-@ stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally dealt with bitter .
despite all , the b@@ rün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ o as@@ sures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone who I had .
or do you believe me , I have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten said that it was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and lived seriously .
it has never confused me or hin@@ der me .
I just never liked it , not taken seriously . &quot;
especially of them , she suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time she loved like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , my children , I would look like a bush .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
now I look back and think : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public , they would not like to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and anno@@ ys me .
and perhaps some may call me ung@@ rat@@ eful but I don &apos;t like to justify to justify the whole public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night on a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayer and thinking about ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will add my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not pay the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
Justice , who according to Forbes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
Forbes proves that he owns coal mines in five states , and have inherited a carbohydr@@ ate from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime the Republican National Committee handed down a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would rather go to us to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 government agencies and the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history is the announcement of Governor Justice only the last re@@ jection of a party that is not able to find a positive , reason@@ ably positive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the worldwide head of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised Thursday that he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Athle@@ tics Championships that had been correct in the sport and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
he said he was sorry for &quot; all athletes who were shot in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was hang@@ ed in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) critics found on state sponsored D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were glad that the Russian Federation has experienced a few hot times and everything is possible to make sure the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted that Russia will accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think that progress was made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this would not be the moment to use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the principle behind it was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes of the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London to compete for the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must be able to meet some of the criteria for a re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement .
drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited policies are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers killed in Mali for a tragedy
during a memorial service in the North @-@ German Frit@@ z@@ lar , some 1000 people had thought of a helicopter landing in Mali in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday at the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
the author &apos;s Minister for Defence has said nothing from the Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two wei@@ rd pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sound of their expertise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come alive a week before a week in West African Mali .
their S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total army of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only the families were par@@ ting in the Church .
afterwards , the celebration of the family began in the circle of the family , eng@@ aging friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Director of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grape seeds laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arm at the s@@ coff@@ ins .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
the Defence Minister of the Ley@@ en called the surrounding soldiers as &quot; high decorated &quot; and sat@@ lan@@ ders .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built a flying helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the Regim@@ ent , said to whom the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If these occup@@ ants could not turn off the crash , no one could have missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Ley@@ en did not show : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a memorial service the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not have any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave beside his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
this was divided the royal house on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard produced a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen agreed to agree with her husband &apos;s decision , it was further on the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
he did not intend to join in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never done a h@@ ype that he was not happy with his title .
he would like to reign after the thr@@ ashing of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 .
he went into retirement in 2016 and also reli@@ es on the title &quot; Prince Sal@@ ahl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not have the title and the function he wanted to see himself not as equivalent to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared , the chief of the Danish King &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will eventually be un@@ clear .
he did not intend to join in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
while his later wife consul@@ ted the symp@@ tom sever@@ ance of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years old regim@@ en .
in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik expressed over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk cra@@ mp@@ ing instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco , and who therefore had the reputation to be the brand @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for looking .
I was different .
I seemed happy to be happy with this position and not be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke to the dis@@ solution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green M@@ EPs from their country fra@@ ction in Lower Saxony was over@@ thrown by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country elections , the red @-@ green coalition lost its defeat a @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday .
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Chief Apostle Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ick@@ ers wants to recommend it to its faction , to record it .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relation was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag is regularly elected on January 14 next year .
he said that the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether they could gover@@ n it without a majority in this situation .
Stephan Weil , however , resi@@ sts for indisp@@ utable that the country &apos;s day quickly decides its self @-@ resolution solution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further procedure on Tuesday .
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the country &apos;s Parliament will withdraw the trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these possibilities have to be considered legally , &quot; said Th@@ ro@@ lean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ ks@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
they described themselves as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called the ab@@ ro@@ aming MPs to the return of their country conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are , of course , that she has received their land @-@ country with immediate effect on the green state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state @-@ president of Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner divided them with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Group &apos;s spokesperson on Green An@@ ja PI@@ EL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets . &quot;
she deliberately decided to run no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background that there was no content dis@@ agreements , we cannot pursue this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ rides of the Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ Midwest for the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens of the Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; the Federal Socialists wrote on Facebook on Friday .
he will support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Parliament quickly .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony &apos;s majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politician &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Political Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her inno@@ c@@ ess and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U carried out in Lower Saxony &apos;s dirty infil@@ tr@@ ate and tried to strike political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precip@@ itation CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ction Chief Apostle Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ick@@ ers wants to recommend his M@@ EPs to absorb El@@ ke T@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
the Fra@@ ction Chief of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the jack@@ ets before , with personal career spending the result of the country elections in 2013 .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest power , SPD and Green were in the country &apos;s Parliament a hau@@ st majority by a voice .
agriculture minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses the contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Secretary of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
Lord Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to view the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states represent the most recent information on the affected eggs Char@@ ges .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even , if we know everything we are currently aware , a health threat is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di will take over the best crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister is not really seen ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house stopped immediately and is located in the close exchange of Germany &apos;s strict exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
the trading has the same as the manufacturer to worry that the sold @-@ selling products are portable and health un@@ think@@ able .
if at eggs the high @-@ level temperature of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not conveniently @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time they are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the current knowledge , production plants does not meet immediate guilt .
rather , they must count due to alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages .
as usual , there is too little checking in the harvest .
is it missing on the staff or even on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
just therefore , a consistent impact of such events and hand@@ ing to the authorities in the cases where crimes can be lying , of crucial importance .
I have already done several times that I expect a full explanation of the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm @-@ mis@@ m really necessary on food sk@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and convenient food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer goods and consumers are righ@@ ted .
manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are given into a situation , which is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ bra@@ il in the position of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable , and must be stopped immediately .
it must be consistently working on all levels and with high pressure .
I expect from all relevant authorities that the atomic fact is ten@@ sion@@ ed and trust@@ worth@@ less .
how the financial rules of the football match to N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ imp@@ aired issues of European football matches , will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain of the UEFA , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules created in 2011 from the UEFA Cup , mean that PS@@ G had to point at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid $ 222 million ( 262 million $ ) to buy Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can make money loose with safety that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich ruler of Qatar .
prohi@@ bit@@ ing a lot of money for acqu@@ iring players , but need to reci@@ ve with legitimate en@@ chan@@ ted sources that allow them to store the break @-@ even point in their own on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that Ver@@ eine , who had enormous debts in their stri@@ ving for success , che@@ ating and ris@@ oned to ruin , if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P returned from concentration on the liabilities of the clubs in the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ mo@@ vich originally sold in Chelsea in 2003 and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
the last three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P de@@ position , which runs until 2018 , clubs would accept losses of 30 million euros .
and even though Plat@@ ini fell by the Presi@@ dency of the United States in 2015 , its UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to take away from excessive spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead , and we will increase the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the estimate for the next five years will be exp@@ elled from 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the club members for the Champions League for the 2014 @-@ 15 season will be limited to 21 players , otherwise the normal 25 players remain limited .
the UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to over@@ take their financial vision by bringing up their income by companies that are associated with owners of a club .
while a cat company could transp@@ ose PS@@ G spon@@ ges , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not apply as legitimate income .
it happened that in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the world &apos;s sponsor of the Qatar Tourism Authority was pu@@ ffed .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar through the organis@@ ational committees of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be am@@ bass@@ adors for the UEFA regulatory authorities to be easy to find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory discussions with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because it was not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a profit of more than 10 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts for the last financial year will still be published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to receive a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot runs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
it is a clear fall of &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in regards to Kat@@ ars .
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed a association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country owns a club , everything is possible .
it will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair@@ play because you can have different ways or different interests if a country has such an actor in order to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sh@@ ag@@ gi@@ ants
over the past years , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y has made local chocolate for Swiss Life .
now the con@@ uts stands in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ wel@@ z &quot; from Friday .
according to recent planning , Air@@ line will end up a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked all two to three years and subjected to a quality check .
&quot; with the current supplier Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker .
approximately 17 million small rot@@ or packed bowls made of 14 grams a year before landing in front of the passengers .
about the cost I wanted to make Swiss no information .
industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around a billion Swiss francs .
but more import@@ antly the advertising effect : for a j@@ ogging producer , it is a prestigious contract .
as many applicants exist in the new announcement , Swiss will not be able to betra@@ y the Swiss .
in question , however , only Swiss producers come .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y wants to try a renewal of the treaty over the spring of 2018 .
the largest Swiss chocolate @-@ producer could not be reached for the S@@ DA .
chocolate boards distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before leaving Swiss a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has built in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate @-@ tablets .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss lived two and a half years ago with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
the customers of the First Class with tasty treats are spo@@ iled by the conf@@ ection@@ eries of Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli in the business class n@@ ap passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .

this re@@ petition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ era ( as the pioneer of David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ old the sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV shoot ) , and for himself - this means for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era ( permanent memories ) .
but as a Franchise , it feels like it would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd human@@ ist ( it contained a original story for a promising canned vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by pushing up on the core of the g@@ ag - actors mid @-@ aged children play hor@@ ny kids to grow up - they nevertheless managed to win the possibility of winning the last part of the Wit@@ ch .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are now adults , is less emotional wise and his par@@ ody is more emotional and his par@@ ody goes to the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ ers @-@ years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that is cra@@ ck@@ les &quot; ) .
at one point , a character is characterized by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line skating and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ old ) , now novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ malign@@ ant Plot , which Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) is included , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian ) .
as usual , the courses are the best part of the franchise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ illons &apos;s mou@@ sta@@ che of &quot; singles , &quot; whose ex @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old b@@ ack@@ ers .
it &apos;s the moments that could pre@@ heat this franchise like a sort of repeated &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I see as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; on the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
the comedy by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created a comedy with R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as director , a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest to fight for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main lead - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic i@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ays to see the view ( the police spend time to view chess in television as Americans might do perhaps with football ) .
and the list of famous spokes@@ persons - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda Dra@@ mas - a mur@@ derer that bears a Reagan @-@ mask is included - that it often plays as a single one .
with six long episodes , it attracts attention , and the comedy isn &apos;t fast or often enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could provide his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p Sati@@ re better , da Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef once again visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a he@@ ap of ham@@ burger .
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can do everything for a seren@@ ity .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators did not go wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with the ih@@ oods .
impact on drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police achieved a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart have searched numerous objects , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office took place on Friday .
in doing so , 15 accus@@ ations were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years , arrest war@@ rants issued against this arrest warrant .
moreover , the officers set larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand euros .
during the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest war@@ rants .
the two will presumably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the promotion .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were used in action .
the members of the Mafia is accused of drug criminal , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office determines the Con@@ stance against organised drug trade in the Southern German space .
between the State Coun@@ ties in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was an exchange exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of the examinations in particular , Italian citizens with respect to the Italian Mafia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant in the morning , is likely to go to the gang of bonds .
wise compl@@ ains large g@@ aps in fore@@ ig@@ ner regi@@ sters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : a report indicates the fore@@ ig@@ ner regi@@ sters in Germany has significant defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to partly engraved mis@@ decisions at asylum procedures .
the prosecution for refugee management in the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has responded to a media report on large g@@ aps in the country @-@ cent@@ ric register .
short@@ com@@ ings in the registered data could result in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; lead in an analysis that lies the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people are registered with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore administered by about 600 extermination agencies in Germany .
because the data has not been well maintained , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , dates from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are long no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and are not allowed to emerge in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; er@@ ron@@ eous data entry may slow down processes , &quot; says the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statistics on trav@@ ellers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are covered by EU citizens , which would not have to travel out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
such false orders , however , led to a united debate about dealing with travel agents , &quot; says it in analysis .
meanwhile , the federal government had begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to return to Italy when they arrived there .
this is out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Zeitung &quot; reports .
according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F conduct such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and small children - after Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation is on site .
after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to reach the EU .
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason the office write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave birth to the inclusion of families of warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) will hold these comm@@ itments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees as part of the Dublin agreement .
the domestic political spokesperson for the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatened with children in the Italian asylum system against illegal detention conditions and a endanger@@ ing of childhood . &quot;
second best results achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons were already available to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens , who were honored on Friday .
in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now has distributed 50 litres of blood , has now divided 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the community lies in the meeting of the Municipal Council to don@@ ate multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is laid out for it and we will have respect for donations that their blood is available for foreigners , nor un@@ profitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the county leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher because the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into its components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher told the actions that are carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change in the theatre house had managed to pay higher number of participants in a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and met@@ a lau@@ rel were awarded to the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 committed blood don@@ ate .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening the inflation of spec@@ ulation about a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain in the middle of a strengthened pressure in the middle of a strengthened pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month , because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing increased growth .
in its quarterly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.6 % and warned for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary budget would continue , however , inflation is expected to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but they indicate that in the next few years of interest rate would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit cost is possibly more than expected to rise to the financial markets .
the members agreed to go back part of the Mamm@@ ut Business Package , which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will be invited to provide funding for the financial plan to provide funding for banks from the coming February , although it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the context of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains very short , since pressure on the re@@ inst@@ ability of households will continue to increase consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain off@@ setting of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent would be necessary to expect markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is currently the first rise in the third quarter of the year and another in 2020 .
however , the bank empha@@ sized that , enh@@ ances &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; would occur .
the Bank &apos;s growth forecast down@@ wards are forecast for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to this news compared with the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.@@ 11 .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth rate increases increasing expectations at a rate of interest and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .
the most recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by an increasing inflation and low @-@ level steps , as the deteri@@ oration first becomes worse before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not stop in the next few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are clear to the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , resulting in a part of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the ground .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to reach the prices and the economy will complete .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank to interest rates , the reputation had increased after a rate of interest , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has decreased from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the bank said that this was expected to come back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that , in relation to its target of 2 % , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent back@@ drop of the s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , as the legisl@@ ature would want to end in a positive way .
the market looks great for those who run the existing de@@ als and closing the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is alleged to prop@@ el HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevalence treatment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September after a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a cancer risk was recorded prior to the sexual intercourse with high risk @-@ position@@ ist ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of risk in high risk cancer by around 86 percent , now from the health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to fund the trial , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court in the past year , according to which the N@@ HS had to pay the powers to finance the local authorities to finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess set announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first to join the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before being introduced in whole England in April 2018 .
pre@@ ex@@ position @-@ hy@@ la@@ xes ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission at Inf@@ ection .
Pre@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or even two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come into question belong to the treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , tran@@ ss@@ ex@@ ual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in hospitals , suitable participants are identified that the study will agree , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who are registered in England and are registered with a veter@@ in@@ arian , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medications in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP using clinical evidence , as it is used in large scale applied , absorbed and implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; these great new intervention should expand the vast and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV and over@@ take HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of persistent progress in raising one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted specifically to needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority is to make sure the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk of HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the Pr@@ EP tests have been designed , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to long @-@ term delay and delay implementation through the Government and over@@ due .
evidence shows how transformed this drug as part of our approach to HIV @-@ prevention and can end the transmission of these life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt takes us closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
it is now important that this study is as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people that are HIV @-@ infected , and that they contribute to contribute that we come closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society .
living big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ sted in 2014 by a great house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne had not packed their bags and sold out .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sought something that was comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
I have loved it in love and made a offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot was over@@ hau@@ led , completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a missed layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezzanine to optim@@ ise the generous amount of deck .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the Architecture and Design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to create 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , to release the awar@@ ding .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked , without leaving us to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just a simple platform to build , but to put steel so that it had the right height above or down the right altitude . &quot;
this arrangement enabled fan to place two rooms at full height - with plenty of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us is down via gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ r@@ oring plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor was mir@@ ro@@ red to leave it longer .
in the kitchen feel the reflection like a window in another room .
at the entrance , pi@@ red units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little engineering of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that when you push the door up@@ side , very easy to guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate mak@@ ler can enter and perform a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the ground surface and use high @-@ quality materials , which provide the space to its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you in the electrical outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be characterized by good design and increased square meters of slightly standard in something very aston@@ ishing .
indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate investment
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a meditation on one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and her business is said to be divided .
Paul has already wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate in value of more than a half billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
the West@@ co jeans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices on Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father Colin - was described by Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court says that Colin is owned by $ 316 million in value and Paul in value of 176 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have left Colin proposed by Colin made him what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday .
the brothers also strug@@ gling to control the existing business , which is Colin , as Paul claims to have it excluded .
Colin argued that this is not true , but throws Paul in front of managing some ownership .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says , he hope to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs are rising in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firms .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Bruns@@ wick .
they used the safety to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood fly , in the Colin opened the first Je@@ ans@@ wood family .
Colin says that he started with West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years &quot; high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis company group , Colin claims that Mark had been paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars .
both Luke and Mark are , says Paul &quot; became bit@@ tered on the terms of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made himself very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took us with Colin and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Colin answered with SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain about and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not say that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Colin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media in@@ st@@ ency of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
poli@@ tico is reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even better course .
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first day of working with the head of the White House , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that got into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would meet better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnose makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his medical device .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps refers to television as a few decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the candidate was angry for a fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite pol@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habits under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps t@@ witter @-@ hab@@ it ever was &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would contain even more ignition .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff managed to re@@ lie@@ ve him some times , anger from him , then their effort was worthwhile .
but nobody has to prevent it consistently , that Tr@@ ump controversy ev@@ okes .
a part of the problem is that people work in a white house that will always try to put together their own agenda by introducing tr@@ ump material , which may promote their views from the world .
poli@@ tico - entirely dealing with this story - reported on the pre@@ ference of pre@@ ference for strategic reasons for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials said that Tr@@ ump is able to respond to negative press excer@@ pts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and to find out how these come from .
just that happened at the end of February , when someone told the president of malign@@ ant a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of &quot; at the White House . &quot;
although Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter , or that he has not offered some specific evidence , or that he has made false accus@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
gold makers added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the pump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly attempts to do the same for three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ors are still stri@@ ving to influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make the Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Mei@@ st@@ unted Ver@@ criminals get postal mail of Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the people of the population will pray and hoped .
the police forces all over Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of searched heavy criminals are not known , not@@ ices from the population is hoping for and to pray .
Euro@@ pol was reported on Friday by the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent calendar from winter .
the experiences had shown that many volatile and holiday destinations hide , it was called Euro@@ pol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one has 21 postcards to be compiled for criminals from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online requested could so far be arrested , at least eleven of them due to the publication of the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of the West Mid@@ lands have returned with some determined trav@@ ellers on the foot of war , which have tra@@ ded one of the congregation drawn from the commune to re@@ demand a field in front of their men@@ ades .
the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transporter , after being cast out in May , without being deported by the Council of the Council to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed her vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
ra@@ ging inhabitants have overcome the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They went there on Monday evening , after being sent on from Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers .
the Council must be forced into action due to shame , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem .
the trav@@ ellers were there in May there , were moved back and now return .
more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle long assign@@ ments in order to protect their parks .
I live without the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy , continue to pay my communal services if the advice can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the numbers have increased this time and even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a member of the Council of Soli@@ hull said , &quot; We are aware of an un@@ authorized camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible .
in order to support our cancer collection , it is very important that as possible as many residents call an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we do our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is coming from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house at the outskirts of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotels Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ence operating company mbH back to April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost each year and also revenues through the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of increasing numbers of refugees , which came into the district , the hotel office was offered as a collection accommodation for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by adding an development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not in@@ cont@@ ested at that time .
but especially the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Julian O@@ ss@@ wald def@@ ending the hotel location and spoke about serious interested visitors at the time .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ausen with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the Group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s Shel@@ ter .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a longer period of building containers before the entrance , and when you enter the house , the extensive renovation work will be made .
the floors were torn out , blank@@ ets are disman@@ tled , antique tubes from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the entrance area will be converted , new windows are installed .
everything should be &quot; pretty close &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
not positioned on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher downtown level , empha@@ sizes scissors .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , would be broad@@ ened , are further explained .
both individual guests , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Krau@@ se already led , so shot .
the city &apos;s ideas are similar to those of the Hotel Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not willing to define exactly .
just under one million euros , it pays .
the exterior facilities are also transported to front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Proc@@ esses To Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller is supposed to have produced a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
the panel I recorded work in the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under his appeal to the matter .
the newspaper turned out the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensi@@ fied .
the station CNN reported that there was already the first re@@ charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to have targeted targeted at the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines if there were abor@@ tions between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign and Moscow .
in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to stand as advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans as an advisor to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also accepted more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Represent@@ atives Tr@@ ump personally p@@ lowed into the centre and under@@ take care of whether the President may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand lawyer &apos;s main task is to examine and decide whether the accus@@ ation should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys will therefore also be called the chief chambers .
generally , they are switched on , if it is greater and controversial cases .
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to the interro@@ g@@ ation under E@@ id .
according to the broad@@ caster CNN , Vor@@ lad@@ ys had already been issued to turn the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in meetings were asked to be called on a statement , named it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
next to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ n election chef Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller is not able to in@@ timi@@ date his work and that if it should be necessary , it will act quickly .
however , it was not mandatory that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide about the prosecution survey .
nevertheless , the composition of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President took a speech in West Virginia in order to present Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign in his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme will give the Democrats a chance to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that they can talk . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a position he know@@ eth nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
this work , however , usually work in the secret , stressed that .
the White House denied any measures that accelerated the work of the &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that won &apos;t be determined against the president .
one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller was not only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ ump , accus@@ ations against b@@ ump were loud , he would like to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation into the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
according to the representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special bro@@ kers and its employees .
this promp@@ ted spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would release .
otherwise , as an independent special agent , as stated in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Nixon &apos;s Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Mu@@ eller suffered a position in which he could be fired by the President of Justice of Justice in theory .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators were dismissed on Thursday , after which the special agent could not be released so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg was replaced by nearly seven @-@ fold size from Berlin &apos;s Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s .
this was divided by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the more than one trillion ton@@ ne of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres is now run into the north and will probably have two , three years until he has melted .
it is a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest king@@ fis@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to man from him .
to the extent of climate change , climate change played a role in the outbreak of the ice , is un@@ clear according to research .
in total , however , there has been a series of unusual coll@@ ars in the region for some 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fac@@ simile background .
according to the opinion of many researchers , it could be related to global warming .
now the broken column has been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is pe@@ aked by big gl@@ aciers .
it is always growing into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rup@@ ture was disturbed several years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ eon was broken there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
it is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s are in danger , because the front edge have never been withdrawn so far as currently .
additionally , the ice plate stand under stress and can fall apart , if there is a piece of breaks .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s and Eis@@ berg rises the sea level , as they swim on the water and p@@ ushes for so much water as it adds to the melting itself .
however , the loss of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ ises causes that the gl@@ aciers flow right into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level , but only in small dimensions , writes the British research project to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s is the fourth largest in Antar@@ c@@ tica , with an area of nearly 50 000 square kilometers .
the move from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick , and the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and not a direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists be controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s go back again , and possibly sum@@ med up , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though this researcher did not withdraw this gigantic ice@@ berg to change the climate change , so in the past decades , however , many king@@ doms of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collapsed .
this long zi@@ pper of the Antar@@ ctic extends towards South America .
according to data on the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has decreased 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have already war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus t@@ amed up to the areas in which the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to lift the hood into the staff
because it is more difficult to occupy vac@@ ancies , the CD@@ U , out of the employers association , are demanding to become more attractive .
just shortly before the summer break the chal@@ k day has lost 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials are working for the management office in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have completed their first day of work .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very sought .
around 620 applications were expected to attend the places this year .
however , the circle is further lacking personnel to cope with increasing requirements and tasks .
at present , the circle M@@ ett@@ mann is currently 50 not occupied places .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of the general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to join the initiative , together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , and in charge of skilled professionals in management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development after the desire of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demands of professionals , but to make future @-@ oriented towards the candidate , it means .
the overall concept should be looking for inside and outside @-@ looking , concrete measures for cross @-@ starting operations and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with staff problems , which one knew earlier so not .
other cities adver@@ tise great civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a regular &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
in addition , a high number of employees , the disease , or age @-@ related age , comes from the service .
so the highest time to act , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , continues with his party yet on the joint application .
he has long been engaged in the chal@@ k day for a fine @-@ thick surprise when he made public debt relief publicly in question and the remaining parties f@@ lowed .
people want all the opportunities to be checked , which provide an exit from the municipal employers association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not in short notice for a satisfactory solution , the round@@ about should go with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - such as people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the CD@@ U attemp@@ ting to pay the employees and officials better when it comes to the Public Service of Public Service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exact , enh@@ ances or more money only if you &apos;re in a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years .
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly growing in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO mig@@ rant life@@ jack@@ ets
Italy has NGOs that use life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not continue , if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat of German aid organisation &apos; Youth Rett@@ et &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human tra@@ ders in a way which facil@@ itated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in the exec@@ uting of the Italian national treas@@ urer Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so , we are very sorry that we cannot operate in search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a position on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all the accus@@ ations that are currently collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth Rett@@ et &apos; , I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew of rubber migrants are on board , which can be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive them again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acquisition of the Prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is susp@@ ects , on the authority of the Italian coast guards , who monitors life sentences in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .
under the code of code , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must mainly have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search of search and rescue operations , have so far been explained to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they would not have &quot; main amend@@ ments or Dis@@ abilities &quot; of their life@@ actions .
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Lau@@ re@@ ates Organisation Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy have declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and co @-@ operation with local citizens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month over economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , who &quot; Berliner &quot; out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nor@@ pf@@ alz region in order to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and sights .
there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine tasting of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ disti@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Forest and the cau@@ dal planes .
in between , there was always longer att@@ endants , for the long tri@@ b@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the popular Wur@@ st@@ markt .
the look@@ out point to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate An@@ tig@@ ege .
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timeter .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shopping h@@ uts were welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ m@@ eten the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ free Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best - sporty and cultural .
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundesliga br@@ ushes for e @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in the future before computer consol@@ es , instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather on the stadium management ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been to an increasing business , become a lu@@ cra@@ tive business , great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages .
this also recognized the first federal lig@@ aver@@ ages that increasingly engage in this field .
in early 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded an E @-@ Sport Division and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Management Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that on this move , some clubs will rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend the FIFA World Cup in London organiz@@ es the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now been a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real soccer ball has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 year olds that young people are still going to go into the stadium , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : those who tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian markets .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under the contract , one could be even more often present on these markets , than just once a year , to send federal membership to Asia .
what &apos;s all about it ?
in the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on un@@ fair competition .
long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ sts have long established themselves to compete against each other .
and by 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly not necessary .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic too has dealt long with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions show that you find also in the classic sport , for example increased heart rate , stress re@@ actions , hormon@@ al changes .

&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but the ac@@ rob@@ atic sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more . &quot;
inspec@@ tions are difficult during online games , and in the scene the structures of classic Sports are missing .
a positive effect raises the scientist the high integ@@ rative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are internationally on the way , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural shirts .
a study by the Del@@ o@@ itte Group consulting and the German Association &apos;s Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and great tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , that is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
International are already on many countries .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodriguez at the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .

Michelle Carter condem@@ ns suicide for suicide , condem@@ ning Conrad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls to suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been abandoned .
Carter was convicted of Conrad Roy in June , because of the death of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter would remain free to appeal .
she was confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representative argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
in red pants and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood up with tears in his eyes , folded hands and down@@ wards eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the public prosecutor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters said , &quot; It was a terrible circum@@ stance that she regret her . &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or Rei@@ g@@ eg@@ rad or even her spirits could have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mutter Lyn@@ n Roy who said that &quot; there is no day in which I do not bet@@ wi@@ ther the loss of my beloved Son .
I want to be proud of me , and how I go with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will be able to meet for eternity with us for his sisters here , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; persecuted by the realization &quot; that she will never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this one person I &apos;ve been together since my birth , is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life always with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a law@@ less preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another , suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , Dep@@ eche yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .
in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything that you must do is to turn the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared legal opinion .
the few who defended Carter , belonged to Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 due to Mor@@ des in their British co @-@ resident in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deser@@ ved compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua returned to the Audi Cup as captain of the Audi Cup , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern th@@ aw@@ ed a big season with the Con@@ fed Cup winner - Male motivation is not gro@@ unded .
something was different in his place in the cabin that Joshua Kim@@ me saw immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ille and also no Manuel New was to be seen , he made his bar@@ k halt on the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one would have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ mir , the sign of the coach , could also signi@@ fy me .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was born in youth games , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the vacation professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide chosen , but he .
sugar is well distributed to those you wish to get a lot of people you want to keep on mood .
therefore , whoever has chosen to compete , the heir of L@@ ille can only be used for a little extra charge .
Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take over responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old became a mini @-@ veil over the field .
on the right side , this is now its position , the white B@@ ind at the arm did its rest .
and at all , Kim@@ mir found me in this start formation as the one who also can take the rod in his hands .
he gave orders , tried to handle the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole thing , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches put out on the services of the Asia journey ( fol@@ ly only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver so that in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t cannot be negative .
this is pretty good .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y from the defense , both ag@@ itated su@@ pre@@ m@@ ely .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , moreover , Sü@@ ver tried to successfully go for a few times in the play @-@ up .
his colleague Rud@@ y said that the result was &quot; not as we were hoping for . &quot;
but he also showed a regular performance at the debut .
playing time , speed change : &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot;
how un@@ used this Bavaria @-@ world is still available for the new approaches , you saw in the connection .
for example Rud@@ y was not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me passed a few cris@@ p statements in his back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting set : &quot; what goes wrong here I already noticed .
in Bavaria , you simply have to win each game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the New Testament anymore .

companies happy with Rheinland @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : Economy pra@@ ises knowledge temp@@ o
it was often un@@ con@@ cili@@ atory , the relationship between the country and regional economy , when Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) in office is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T @-@ V inquiry by a change in economic policy - and simultaneously the former Minister of Foreign Affairs .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ als Company ( V@@ TU ) says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
the largest swe@@ eping turn makes Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the pri@@ st@@ list of the country at the top of the country .
this year the Ministry of Planning hopes to be a planning procedure , until 2021 shall be the construction law .
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the West@@ ern@@ ment of Trier , which is on the most striking demand of the Federal roads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to take into operation the course of December 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Industry ( I@@ HK ) is driven by Trier , as seen by Wis@@ sing , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the I@@ HK .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier looks an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is intended for the residence exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master@@ y .

CD@@ U @-@ faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the machines of the machine , investing more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 , less in the receipt of country roads as proposed .
furthermore , Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country how it wants to fix the skilled professionals in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the far full broadband building in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3,4 .

Audi is to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturer faced with a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the company said that the company said that &quot; there are more intelligent options as a travel restrictions , &quot; and thus referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles can provide or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are regarded as carcin@@ ogens , and may cause asthma .
the cost of automotive manufacturers , plants to neutr@@ alize the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles by diesel vehicles , also take what it makes difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful automobile companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ age devices that could regulate emissions if a car has been tested , but for normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in Germany was arrested in Germany &apos;s engine development .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be judged in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused of being installed a system installed in order to avoid the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that has been concentrated on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could badly load Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer has disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately propor@@ tion@@ ately to the Volkswagen win .

in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drawing for greetings cards - what makes it fru@@ str@@ ated .
&quot; the most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the &apos; 60s the breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris match , and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .

lavender from Provence &apos;s Climate Change
it has become a symbol of Provence in southern France but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the lavender plant is decl@@ ining due to Dür@@ re &apos;s conditions and due to the diseases transmitted insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , getting great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender plant in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to climate change during the past years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of lavender .
there is also a little c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the bo@@ oted k@@ warf , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
lavender oil attracts not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered in consideration are a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the floor , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water , and the development of sorts , which are more dr@@ y@@ ness .

the murder of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce meet normally on Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ audi@@ ble drug wars .
but on that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : you should take their children to the office , which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leaving them at home .
security experts have three words written on a board on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the rep@@ orters , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , per@@ cep@@ tions and abdominal muscles .
there are drug fisher@@ man , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make chaos of Mexico .
there is no rest of violence , and throughout the country the bodies are frequent , there are more journalists at the same time : at least 25 , since president Enrique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto left his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 lives in attacks and threats from Bundes@@ schutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter , the editor and their in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder , Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt , although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop will take place less than two months after his death and the orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
a special At@@ tor@@ ney of At@@ tor@@ ney was built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee of Journ@@ alists , to the Protection of Journ@@ alists only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murders , which are associated with drug trade and organised crime , the kill@@ ers of journalists are only rarely faced .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still consist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ east , and although the terrain is still more de@@ fam@@ ously .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting point for the security of safety , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid , my time to waste in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we know why we know all things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the paper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the shooter drove out in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left one woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to walk around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but Val@@ dez &apos;s theme is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the surrender in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of dec@@ or , two @-@ story mou@@ ths of drug royal , which are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work is Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt because he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first published in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival boxes in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons .
this release may have been annoying , presum@@ ed gear members bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake had not to force Val@@ dez , following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same history , leaving the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were aware that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ ste in 2003 when he joined the founding of five colleagues at the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 USD .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without pressing the rocket problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
with the time , the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising participated .
rep@@ orters loved it , hard run tests without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication , in which they could read stories that nobody else had to treat .
after eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead them .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take the job taking place as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would not be asked : &quot; what did you do about so many things ? why did you not say what went before ? &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse as a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar over the office , go and sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for a routine ?
his death also forced them to ask their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it , if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their home and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ determination and self @-@ keeping .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , keep away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happened . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive s@@ mu@@ ters , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where employees arrived from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to security training , suddenly no mobile phones are allowed . days earlier was known that Spy@@ ware that was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside the heat , two polic@@ emen were looking outside the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ sized building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who described the Governor itself as not trusted .
it is months ago since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug may be under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce took place on three main stories .
there was the murder of the former poet Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Chavez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é on the state spending , focusing on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group built in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug retailers and authorities .
a reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant registered under the name of a politician , who belonged to the ruling In@@ stitutional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases .
in Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orters to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man had escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have watched the column of Val@@ dez , as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body @-@ fit .
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the kill@@ ings of journalists , dedicated because the employees have become something that they never expected , activists in the name of the press .
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez hi@@ ked a few signs and went to a demonstration on a demonstration due to another journalist for the Office of the Office .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the Western State of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists have become more popular throughout the country by writing them in organised protests , &quot; SOS Press &quot; on walking routes and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez departed in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a following the murder of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to liber@@ ate journalists and kill them because they have told the truth .
it has since then asked that it is re@@ group@@ ed from the government because it is worried that her anger has injured their objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly mentioned that journalists in Mexico of organised crime , involved in government officials and a valid company . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug media , but also on orders of politicians and security forces , who raised the organised crime under a blanket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recorded more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll die in Mexico because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the Mor@@ de have a deter@@ ring effect .
nobody knew the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ sets were beside her se@@ per@@ ated head .
some branches have chosen to close the paper El Nor@@ te at the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continues , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly established the drug @-@ style with an article on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be a poet , is said that drug dealers are frigh@@ tened it .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became reporter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce at the pav@@ ement took place in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sum@@ s up .
a number of shooting with band@@ ry and security forces near the seaside Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from boarding stones they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed next day .
Sir@@ ens are close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers , guard the guard to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
among the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible for very Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Javier was murdered , the intern &apos;s intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used camoufl@@ age to do@@ dging his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , even though a terri@@ fying .
now researchers have found that the first findings of an incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mines were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his shoe skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something of an &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved dinosau@@ rs , which has ever been found , and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has researchers to describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic is the ar@@ mo@@ red plant carni@@ vo@@ res the best known fossil its kind .
it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that was out of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely .
the Fossi@@ l discovered that was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy traffic .
after all of these hard work the ready result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have blind@@ ed a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the principal actor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist of the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum , where the creation is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a driven tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ e@@ aters dinosau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs used a red and white camoufl@@ age to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ ach@@ ute that is used as counter@@ bur@@ s@@ ement , which is also used by many modern animals .
it would have been allowed to mix well better in its surroundings and sof@@ ten his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by greater dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creation from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techniques Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the shape of scales and arm@@ aments about his body .
they discovered the con@@ sha@@ ded , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the counter is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta are by far the animals living today .
it suggests that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by the carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs by flesh , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation was favourable as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , which are entering the con@@ sha@@ dy - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ thro@@ es - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey , which was sign@@ alized that this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs ro@@ ar of the chal@@ k time must have been , &quot; Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ rs was brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on hin@@ ts about his life , including its Con@@ ser@@ rated Dar@@ min@@ tes to find out what it had eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river and pushed into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor .
at that time Alberta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today .
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is covered completely with preser@@ ving skin , but remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early chal@@ k period .
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you have a little bit of your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , carni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which were on two legs , passed through the earth .
although King of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11@@ ,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after death in the sea and in mud .
the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada .
according to the Museum , it is the man@@ ned Dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the th@@ igh .
the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant e@@ aters was pushed by Western Canada , until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the dinosau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste always cover hol@@ lowed tank plates along the dinosau@@ r
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , it is such a level of maintaining as &quot; rare as a profit in Lotto .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
the remains of the skin cover always the hol@@ lowed tank plates , which carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot lies on his side , his five fingers crossed up upwards .
I can count the scales at its sole &apos; .
a storm : mass strike at A8 : many injured parties
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arm@@ or .
there are many wounded , kilometers long st@@ out - and G@@ aff@@ er .
around 20 people were injured at the Stuttgart @-@ Munich Highway ( A8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first indications of the police were at 5@@ pm between the terminals of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm of almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , probably also trucks .
over the exact number of the injured figures did not appear earlier .
he had a slight up@@ beat injuries , said a police officer said .
a huge array of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich a few ten @-@ kilometer @-@ long retreat was formed .
like a AZ reporter reports , it also appeared on the return track to massive disability - by numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched themselves the attributes of the vehicle g@@ limmer , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was another accident at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between an Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ sport@@ sman and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing walks in the train and sleeps .
or you &apos;re ti@@ e@@ ft in his work and has just a brilliant thoughts .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens an inst@@ ant@@ ment or breaks the g@@ ast in the middle of the workflow .
ticket subscription .
but times of breaks are over soon .
the German Rail@@ ways currently testing the shelf @-@ free ticket control .
it simply confirms using mobile phone that one should be taken place and utili@@ zes the ticket .
currently a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offering , wide and wide we get it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany next year on many further correspondence routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a path speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the train the ticket stand@@ ings without a conductor .
in order to use these , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to be booked an online ticket - what we have to do in most passengers already .
you have to have bought it via the app by train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works : one clim@@ bs to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for the electronic stand@@ ings .
the train drivers receive a message on their mobile devices that the g@@ ast X is in the train and has taken the booked seating area Y .
if the train guide comes to number Y , he knows that a passenger is already already set up on a passenger online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the trains - which is to take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel without a job monitoring by our train personnel , check out the DB navig@@ ator simple . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Managing Director of DB .
second plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs . &quot;
who often drives trains , knows that next to late and changed trains the ticket controls are among the greatest troubles .
because often , in any case , one of the participants do not need all the documents you need for the evaluation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or a document that you have to advance .
the result is endless discussions between train drivers and drivers , which leads to bad mood in part or large @-@ room and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time takes care of taking care of the other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw numbers on the same route are still un@@ locked .
how an activist came to study the answer to question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her core on August 9 , 2014 .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ roll@@ out by Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by somebody from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed an 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since no one else had posted information on her feed , she finished Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the field of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he posted a picture of brow@@ ns le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was exp@@ elled on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell was thinking .
but death was nothing new for her and their community .
she made her mobile phone to go to Twe@@ et on the Can@@ field drive later on the evening .
there were photos from the police band and people , the scre@@ aming , and from a man who claimed that Brow@@ ns to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman stand in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman sh@@ out and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; it is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her testimony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she fet@@ ched her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary movie &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , the power and loss of power , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of men who live in the community and filled the streets to ask answers .
as Fer@@ rell &apos;s daughter , who carried a flower dress and a fine crown , came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ minded of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we go now to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 year old boy , and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take it away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what is happening now is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know and see it and be tu@@ cked up .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves .
even if I have good luck to give her an experience in which she does not experience any ec@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling I would like to point out her a bad service , to keep it far off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which was waiting for a camp@@ ground when the activists on the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson were waiting .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter worked together with a local business@@ man who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to accept a new species of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black con@@ greg@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell &apos;s sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from the wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew , have not cent@@ red their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for its activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was to concentrate on Fer@@ re@@ lls experience - to show that it is not a &quot; Messiah &quot; movement , but for a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ re@@ lls lives , as she loves herself and marry her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understand that there must be certain danger at this work , and in the realization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ re@@ lls history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teenage dog Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to observe that &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women . &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a affir@@ matic type of action , &quot; by the tur@@ ally due to its identity as the heart of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who shook her energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , even though it was at the fore@@ front , because in a life on these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the message records in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the rac@@ ist links between the congregation and the police continue to stand .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ o @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless they cl@@ ert itself to a singing and she has committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; Meg@@ a@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss with bit gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although they are still not built .
but the idea of a shopping centre in the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the people in supporters and opponents since the first presentation .
cold the subject is hardly possible .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one of the bit Gallery says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery will attract more customers in the city , including the rest of the other business , fear the opponents that the pedestrian zone should ble@@ eds .
in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the grounds where the farm market stands , where 13 direct marketing products are offering their products .
construction work will be concluded with the start of the construction work .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been selling nearly weekly in the farm market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land@@ lady always happy again .
we discovered the but@@ cher shop for us too .
we would wish that , during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is very interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the level of rent .
but this should probably not be low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is your shopping street in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
one sees how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular week market , it is more important that at least the market stands at least remains .
after all , the goods offered here is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive .
as you see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only of larger firms , because the local owners are often not portable .
too bad , special stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farm market place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - also in duration if the bit gallery will actually come true .
or does it bring the Sp@@ ect@@ st bit gallery already before , to drive all the shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and shopping center that is empty , no one needs .
for my opinion , it would have been better to promote a proper pe@@ asant market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farm market place , yes , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
when the pe@@ asant hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching resem@@ blan@@ ce : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the center of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , that are almost invisible - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cut , which you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analyst started a 35 @-@ year sentence after having publicly designated diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and landmark dis@@ co , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created the DNA analysis of the DNA which could look from Mann@@ ing and made from the 30 portraits , such as someone else can look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many wise men as they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also created to identity .
Mann@@ ing , born as Bradley Edward was born , but had been spoken openly about the identification as a woman , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
by the prison the picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is inten@@ tionally sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a flat blonde perfor@@ ation - which she was associated with .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
in this , the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette jack and chew@@ ing gum by extracts the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg declared in a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so they contacted Contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were not un@@ equal to Bri@@ dging , who ex@@ terminated several letters in the course of two years .
they even created a shot of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte Comic &quot; Supp@@ orting Images , &quot; which would convert a future to see the President Chel@@ ly &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings would release for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome way of happy acqu@@ isi@@ tions .
there are also some deep deep deep @-@ looking at the opening of the exhibition , because Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ aked ways , which he should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to pass for a certain reason . &quot;
in a written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with her superior signature ( which &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic destruction , whose foundation are gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall the mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the artist &apos;s highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological ways , we are all .
&quot; what people are hopefully to take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are , and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic nov@@ elle .
it shows man@@ ing as they appear with the hands of hands in the United States , such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never make the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , which greet them from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I always get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I speak about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it should be taken before in the comic book - but when they should do it , then it will be welcomed into the middle of the space of masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ls , who are cl@@ assed as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also targeted as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford were sought for murder .
a nationwide crowd @-@ hunting is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who sought for susp@@ ects for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , arrest war@@ rants were issued on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest war@@ rants because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the municipal court by Cook County .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stal@@ ks .
a general warning system by the Chicago police report states that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
civil servants received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the sacrifice with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder while police is active after the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 L@@ ath@@ em is extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice @-@ President of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now being so@@ aked and excluded from the Campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is studied by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK in contact and ready to assist the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities on every possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ rens colleagues were shocked and want him to be surprised .
in Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to turn down the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has a vision of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi told that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , who would have happened in the apartment of 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team from Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of motives , including a possible domestic ancest@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
the Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of schedule R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the schedule of WA@@ DA to comply with Code who describes the criteria for re@@ inst@@ ating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organisation &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko he contains nothing that could cause Russia &apos;s occasion for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria reported in the list of criteria , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the reported results of approved by the WA@@ DA attor@@ ney , Richard McLaren to alleged state sponsored d@@ oping in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has stood an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os Wor@@ ked with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the director of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales offices at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report controversial positions and regulations .
nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v .
in November 2015 R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the implementation of d@@ oping control in Russia .
however , you are allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved into the right direction . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs more
this divided the company groups .
there is a pure precau@@ tionary measure , it could continue to be assumed not from any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was said in the message .
from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ l@@ itt@@ les .
Al@@ di wants to manufacture clarity and transparency with its customers .
the Start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ rett wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even when you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the trial .
&quot; there was simply no consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ rett , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .
she called people from the outside to help .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , allows companies to provide advice , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the board of directors .
&quot; they are now tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for prosecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used to measure employees .
Er@@ rett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows most complaints and which executives may have low consent results - so you can drill down why .
companies are coming to see that at the fore@@ front of the workplace culture , you do not have to be involved in sc@@ and@@ als that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since then a former employee describes a blog post which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , with those who have spoken .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cra@@ tive business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , after the financial technical website let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent poor behaviour and identify , saw an increase in interest and activity in early this year am@@ id@@ st the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
convert has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber has recently signed as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t lets Conver@@ cent businesses send tailor @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , collect confidence in real time and view the warmth @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report bad behavior .
and if the principal leader is involved , complaints directly to the supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or in@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , employee curse and g@@ ages , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Conver@@ cent is used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures , and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said it was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Conver@@ cent stuck , problems re@@ mot@@ ely identified by managers who were in offices in cities or states were hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or less intern@@ ship qu@@ icker and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this hol@@ istic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disp@@ utes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
businesses began to take Ethics , Val@@ ues and Employ@@ ee commitment in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of eth@@ ic hi@@ kes due to the Enron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor eth@@ ics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and are loaded up the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors , which both have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million .
in November , we secured a total of $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more jobs than before .
competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you are doing is worthwhile , then you feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employ@@ ee Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach yields when their portfolio are doing well . companies run fine when employees are working and engaged .
if the analy@@ tics tools are third @-@ party promise , commitment and deployment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace @-@ culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks people to your feedback , it can have a expec@@ tation that change is on the way .
and if the change doesn &apos;t come fast enough , or at all , it can be dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ating employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the business management company Kot@@ ug International , who has seen company focusing on the collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow the employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Reed , who has passed the monthly head@@ p@@ olls in now , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ rett .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize and add multiple teams within the company and add a full service training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always maintains a new insights over the employees , and it hopes for a long view , that leads to a better bond of workers in a industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; Vit@@ rano said .
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose your business .
the N@@ CAA sol@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields on the campus are maintained .
some have gone out their tri@@ cot kern@@ els and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ attended minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return after three hour exercise to their final tests before they return at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the guys the next three days a genuine T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ CAA eliminated two @-@ day exercises to make the burden of the player easier , and she has extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
that is why the first three training of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 starts to meet the already full packages of the players .
the compromise route from the two days is more than one day , to whom the camp moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school during Mor@@ as took six play times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to keep 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the formal play preparations for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said he will support the change in N@@ CAA , even if they add a further point of time to the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put these enormous loads of three or four days on them , and it is challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pulled it through , they plac@@ em@@ med themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is ended , what has been raised in view of the clear views of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the higher class , which is already equipped with foot balls , which will be no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent there , and then set up there to draw an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I am not too much worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential article with counterfeit detection of third parties and whose results are then shown below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mach@@ ined learning methods to send possible detection messages , and send them to fac@@ t@@ ability , which may display results of the fac@@ t@@ ance from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem is also become a big political issue in Europe , where French elec@@ tors were flooded in May with false stories , and Germany supports a plan according to social media networks if they did not succeed to eliminate h@@ asser@@ tive post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook was saying in a separate statement on German that the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany would have launched a test of new facts .
&quot; in addition to the realization that stories of fact @-@ checked third parties , people want to find more context to find detailed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; link in connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on other changes to his messages feed to decrease false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the tiny Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 15 years a si@@ p@@ hole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his hom@@ ely seat in the Main@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look to the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &quot; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , next British artist - Isaac L@@ enk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book from Rhodes which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wrote on the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that has been written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters always smell of smoke , because then a fire lit because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect as if it himself would be .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is working with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have a little over@@ rated &quot; ) that seems to be true to be true .
Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , like the mon@@ ished hy@@ enas in the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with country @-@ care , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then he drank whis@@ key &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown as the National Trust received the full access in 2006 than the last year@@ book , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employee started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps , who , who owned what had said : &quot; you could mean that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in order to have fought two families .
guys , let it go all its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point to settle for a bro@@ ader basis in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the pe@@ asant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tum@@ ult that occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rhodes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pe@@ asant uprising began in this field and I thought a insur@@ rection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories are ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ern@@ ers who hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell portra@@ yed out of the 18th century , which filled his own funeral , filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his sar@@ g was dug up ) .
the Dar@@ re@@ lls are Rhodes &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &apos; the gentle@@ men seemed to be a real G@@ aun@@ er to always make debts , and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell male sol@@ es their debt crisis , giving rich old women , I put it to me as a he@@ ap of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote arous@@ ing . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ ha@@ em@@ mä@@ ki in the early 20th century , which has since been re @-@ demanded from the nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Ah , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ eh@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ eh@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign for introducing a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z will keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August , there is a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; to be nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not think this ( of course ! ) do not really write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on their last yesterday &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in order to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
basically , we are convinced that we know as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens around the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action there is more than just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it will continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is to form@@ ulate a single standing promise , one that gives the city a distinctive feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eventually they stand in the competition with other commun@@ es .
a mid @-@ digit amount can be found in Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f &apos;s new umbrella brand and campaign costs .
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear in front of the army
every year , at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) s@@ own over retirement and promotion at the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as earlier , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the leadership of the head , the five vice @-@ president and ministers also took part in defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs .
in this way , the civilians were in the Y@@ as .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the General Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force , and the Navy were depos@@ ed .
since the failed cou@@ p , Prime Minister Erdo@@ gan has fired 3@@ 26 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire attempted coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who were involved immediately on the coup attempt will act in Ankara since this week .
on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of the &quot; divine gift &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erdo@@ gan really in handle ?
in late February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ le@@ agues in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are Bes@@ or@@ g@@ ites for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which manifest itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ land ban for soldier , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the big clean@@ ers in the army and the security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan left another 73@@ 95 government operators , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
in doing so , Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military .
gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times , they defeated their role as the keeper of world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan won the power of the military step by step , not least to appeal to reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is managing targeted Islam@@ ization of the forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; an emin@@ ent officer , who sought refuge for the coup attempt in charge of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this is the case , Nato &apos;s development could not be cold .
anyway , there is doubt in the alliance after pur@@ pos@@ ing doubts about the availability of the Turkish army .
the management structures and operational abilities were &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
he looks ahead to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations on visa permit for a fixed work permit and restrictions on families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the US will change the way to citizens from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have English to support the financial resources to promote themselves and show knowledge that will benefit from our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to start circuit board shuttle
over the past few months , over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les have been controversial - now it &apos;s meant to go fast .
even before the end of the year , at the mar@@ ching circuit , on which the tourist network is to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the German Ministry of Commerce , construction work began in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and continue to order the track of Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , conf@@ esses the country especially for the tourism key , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Transport Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the rep@@ airing of the route rec@@ eded to about 2.5 million euros .
this sum takes 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will defini@@ tively be coordinated , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry of Staff and the Southern Thur@@ ing@@ ian railway have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the road@@ map , the vehicles used and quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this enables the race to be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the race airport shuttle is one of the popular train connections between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot store , in the course of a pilot project , the distance of enough many people is being exploited to order it again in the future .
the circuit is also very dil@@ api@@ dated in parts .
the A@@ scen@@ sion of Sex Robot is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought that it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robot .
yes , indeed .
sex robot is at the moment a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Rob@@ otik ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Rob@@ otik and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and the co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their rise seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ p@@ ples and type of fing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people are fun , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the release of his new report .
modern rop@@ es have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
the user can adjust its robot in accordance with his beliefs , &quot; and then select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails .
but there is still more wor@@ rying , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look like a step@@ ford @-@ woman of progressive .
modern rop@@ es have evolved to robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing such as school@@ ing .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Comp@@ an@@ ion as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that has been adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Comp@@ an@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day , she has their m@@ oods - just like real people !
she can be tired , fixed on conversation , or can be &quot; in mood &quot; !
there are many wor@@ rying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ jec@@ tively feminine qualities to rape , if you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resi@@ den@@ ying ) Far@@ rah is worried , wor@@ rying a most .
on his website True Comp@@ an@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a Vi@@ br@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vi@@ br@@ ator , why do males then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is on the site .
however , this sex robot is not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement to something dar@@ ker and ti@@ tho@@ it in our culture , to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender Equality to a wish after sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
most men will , of course , have no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices its rising popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumer culture .
but what is le@@ ak@@ ened out of the boundary , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or offensive to give them the free market to this .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed Sex robot in a time are threatened , in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which the White House has a president to have pra@@ ising women sexually attacked .
the most horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the more closed body and the extinct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this doesn &apos;t feel like a big jump .
the objective behind this sex robot is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their her@@ edit@@ ary ar@@ quit@@ ecture , that they feel deser@@ ving that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robot does not represent real women .
you can &apos;t separate or go away from their companion .
they do not have medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that could cause independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jug@@ ation .
expressed differently : they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ we@@ ish@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump era that the policy circuits that have polarized the US elec@@ torate , even families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving , there were newspapers in the USA , with advice on how to circum@@ vent with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ chosen relatives .
we all allegedly ri@@ gor@@ ously hit us to burst our filter bubbles .
less not@@ ices is the power of tr@@ um@@ ps , families .
I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ wing poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it re@@ minded me that the unit can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite pec@@ uli@@ ar at the same side .
in order to find the dining table , it is certainly a good thing , but it affects me in another link that this also brings significant risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right .
when we speak of &quot; Norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that his cookies will not be rep@@ elled by one day .
there is , however , a more dre@@ ad@@ ful long @-@ term scenario , to the right wing of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which appears suddenly in comparison to his standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of neg@@ li@@ on@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ gency version - the dog on the Aut@@ od@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax expl@@ aining ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a very mild off@@ ender .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can only be mentally healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ el of the New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars you can spend in town if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are b@@ ang@@ y and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music gives this a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a town dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city becomes a dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not throughout the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the themes @-@ pub @-@ Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience , because here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on and everyone had a great time .
if I had given the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked them afterwards .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
at the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to get the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the cargo .
this does not only lead to a slow@@ down , which should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was pri@@ med , while I was tired of experience , having made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us advanced with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the jail for a hospital for the second time .
last year , he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of schi@@ avo , which he suffered from prison agencies according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal against the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed ste@@ wards in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s day in 2013 , by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us alleged that he held his girlfriend for a night @-@ like int@@ ru@@ der , which hidden in the cabin .
prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this year against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el by which they say they are too transparent .
the National prosec@@ utions Authority reported that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the ob@@ jection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as pe@@ asant Arnold find an odd egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the four @-@ t@@ anned schools were s@@ nat@@ ched out of funds and funds in school holidays and in the continued schools .
three of the release students will go to high school , four in the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening the parents and representatives of the public in the Civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen welcomed the public .
as a symbol of the school office , the 29 students of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eag@@ les , who is growing in the poultry farm , but then freed in freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower Sh@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the poultry farm . &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken cr@@ ush a small eagle came out .
but hope to make a chicken out of him , struck the eag@@ les spread on a high mountain its wings and escaped .
afterwards the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank a chicken .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders to carry the bet .
the Eagle stand for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
although the young is different than the other vir@@ gins ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free .
they wish every fourth @-@ wat@@ ery that he felt in his new school .
it was followed by than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , former school director Michael Mu@@ eller , who always jumps with l@@ ashes , and the parents advoc@@ acy .
the cooking time is over , the class teacher Sophia Schumacher stated .
she leave her students after two years of lessons only very , because it was a really great time .
finally she was able to rely on the four t@@ kl@@ ands .
for the conclusion , all students were given a song of summer time and holiday season .
this broke great joy with the children .
for the new school year , eight first aqu@@ educ@@ ators have already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were detained for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , the police was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , she was released , while the investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened the control of the free camp , and place every one that is found to stay in one place , which is not intended for this purpose , has significant money fin@@ es .

the Ministry said that the court may appeal a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
does diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
in the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ based software updates available for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should increase the emission of emissions of the emission of Euro 5 and some euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine by ACE Auto Club Europe provides app@@ rais@@ als :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates are valid only for vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schumann Software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their upgra@@ ding has arranged the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
manufacturers have announced a generous implementation in the next few months , but not called no exact date .
Daimler has informed everyone to write to anyone .
if anyway , if you want to be ob@@ sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zed , this will be done in its framework .
how long might the upgra@@ des move altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anine says .
the hang@@ ings of the company &apos;s commitment , as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not deal with the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the garage .
it could be time @-@ consuming to receive an appointment .
what are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE will wait to wait .
presumably foreign producers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anine .
is now a massive price fall from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears it .
but even in the regions where passengers thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there are no added losses for older diesel .
the ACE is advis@@ able to still wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize awards under President Tr@@ ump promises to be politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .

as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , the singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman L@@ ear ( 95 ) also contributed to the schol@@ ars .
the Awards will be handed over to the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump is given a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will participate in the award .
the winners of L@@ ear , which announced with progressive TV series , has already announced to aband@@ on participation in the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presi@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an empha@@ sized that they will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clear their visibility .

we are making the city alive
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ di@@ master , continues in retirement in the coming year .
the place is already written - appropriate applicants are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been at the age of 31 for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he gives in the press conference .
it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for its successor .
at the same time wonder , so far no application is required to fulfill the requirement profile .
the city seeks an architect or building engineer to the next possible time .
thus , under the contemp@@ t of regular employment periods - will be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach acts for the administration of the administration as an under@@ lying building authority , the candidate must indicate the appropriate conclusions .
this feature wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could not fill this out more , citizens would have to go to the dis@@ closure of Offen@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is close to the city and it is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker who tells about a good operating lim@@ a as well as good mood among the authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are making the city liv@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the branch parking place are accumulated .
the theat@@ rical bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
a medieval room for a Stadt@@ bau@@ di@@ master is present .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and fermentation shop , it can be respon@@ sive to many flexible .
&quot; we can move much , &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors .
since the old city as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye to do what matches , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ating town car@@ et@@ aker are stressed .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ di@@ master bears high responsibilities anyway .
he is Bau@@ herr , &quot; at the end everything runs here on my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination , he can count on long @-@ standing employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing since ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) has been for 15 years .
also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
for continuity is not only important for a good operating profit , but also for the further design of the city .
those who want to bury Roland W@@ acker , should be used as a graduate engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree as a graduate engineer or Bachelor with specialized knowledge in the fields of construction and design law .
the City Hall of Building and civil engineering , construction management , under@@ mining activities , administration of urban properties , urban development department with building yard and urban hus@@ band@@ ry and sub @-@ construction authority , including monument protection .
bike on lines thrown : southern route closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike from the track der@@ is@@ ations in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were badly damaged , that the her@@ ann@@ ess freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out from two male servants and looking for the night hours after them .
near the scene there were witnesses of a ros@@ oter roller and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a pair of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators brought himself great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the facility , as well as the delay @-@ off and the cost of rail traffic , P@@ ön@@ alen @-@ customers can also return to the perpet@@ rators .
all in all , the spokes@@ man said , &quot; said the spokes@@ man .
the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway could be guided without disabilities .
barely ten people were out@@ lined Friday afternoon , two of them entered the correspondence .
goods did not fall out , however , they had delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 metres of out@@ lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meats , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( oral formulation )
red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study conclu@@ des exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could re@@ lie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United States in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and pet@@ als , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme drow@@ sin@@ ess .
while the suffer@@ ers usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins work to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide inside the food is not allowed to enter into the body .
cells , who are able to destroy inflammation , are balanced out of cells who promote tolerance and protect the body without damage the sensitive tissues .
if the balance is incl@@ ined toward inflammation , it may result an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments we found that a type of tolerance stimul@@ ated immune cell in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had their immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ mi@@ li@@ eus , when the same system also helps people with people .
the post@@ doctoral fellow in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan seeking a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was separately housed , this did not .
it presum@@ ed that the difference in the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ os@@ omes had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice that were lacking in mice .
mice were re@@ ared in a sterile environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria used on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then brought small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
as the active component of the liquid is cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect them in our gast@@ ro @-@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans like in mice , but defects in genes on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; The evolution of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed to &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the Chelsea &apos;s 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season game before the UEFA Cup @-@ Cup at Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impressed people as Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was exp@@ elled from the early @-@ time Asia tour of the blues and eliminated only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready later than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started the avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted to commit three more recent claims , but he insi@@ sted that the club had done a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfill three of his four primary claims .
&quot; three from four to get , I thank the club , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they got four out of four , but they have given much trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew in Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .

on the radar monitors the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole thing was a lasting test for new engines .

a new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still a SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Minister joined the elections with a certain concern to Berlin .
only there are no stor@@ k from the party &apos;s headquarters , merely a head@@ wind from the Bund , so the most important desire of the election warrior .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , it has fundament@@ ally changed .
since then , the employees come from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus with growing dis@@ may the events in the SPD @-@ ruling national capit@@ als .
what Schulz has been from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counter@@ wind .
there were deep advice .
and one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against Ko@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green cannot be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ist of a Green Party suffered the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the country elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party of the Green Party , Michael Win@@ ner , invited the ab@@ etting of the Sax@@ on Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ ets to return its mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the voters .
El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the federal leader and election campaign of the Green Party editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sigh@@ s a SPD electoral soldier , as on Friday morning the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message has reached the party bure@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the transition to the green members of El@@ ke T@@ Midwest to CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the provisional point of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what is coming next .
the Mis@@ ere started with un@@ expect@@ edly defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the com@@ rades of the stone .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was also true - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a stag@@ ger , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ a pre@@ ten@@ te the party .
com@@ rades took the com@@ rades in the weeks after that .
then when they had exhausted all the courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next descent .
Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD land@@ slide , lost his Nim@@ bus for the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burnt .
and because he made everything wrong in the crisis communication , so quite all that you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust gas emissions and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister had already been critic@@ ised in criticism .
mi@@ ese remov@@ als came up .
nevertheless , or maybe because , in the past few weeks , Weil tried to keep the league in Ak@@ z@@ ente .
com@@ rades of the former civil master from Hannover to build his power in Berlin , com@@ rades in the environment of Martin Schulz remained un@@ hidden .
they let him give , because they spoke of because a stabil@@ ising of the party .
now the exact opposite may occur .
because of this , because of the adher@@ ence , the Lower Saxony is basically no fault .
and Schulz not even at all .
at times , com@@ rades therefore endeav@@ oured to keep his own ranks .
their anger is set up on the green , and above all on the back@@ sliding par@@ liament@@ arians in the west .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and more democratic , like Mrs T@@ jack@@ ets her own career @-@ eating over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the party leaders in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs T@@ ire has not been elected to Parliament because of its person as a direct candidate but on the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party .
the logical consequence would be that it returns their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as the leader in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of personal CD@@ U dep@@ u@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fied the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said .
he requested to clari@@ fy the backgrounds .
I want to know if there was more or more ongoing comm@@ itments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ance of the city centre III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his years , can soon get support from the country .
informed about Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of city development on Wednesday in sensation .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler returned to date at the beginning of the information event .
since 1991 it has been in sensi@@ tis@@ ation areas .
at that time , in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the restoration area II from 2005 to 2016 , the net income fell by still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is last@@ ly important to promote the internal development , and not only build new areas of construction .
on April 4 , we received information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe , that there will be a renovation area III .
the amount of funding amounted to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which £ 500 Euros from the country , the rest of the congregation .
what is a renovation area then ?
one will continue to investigate , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continues to investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
it also plays a role , whether in the planned area of any interest , to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the area limits could then move again .
the remarks on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social town , &quot; in which frame would then be carried out .
core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of interior teams , improving the living and working conditions and receiving and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the restoration area would eventually be set as a stat@@ ute .
the approval process for the funding is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only be carried out until September this year , as part of those involved in the restoration area involved a questionnaire .
in November or December , the amend@@ ment will be made to begin with the renov@@ ations next year .
after that , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commun@@ e had to carry on the alleg@@ ations of investigations .
it is therefore , to evaluate the urban abuse of abuse and to decide when it is renovated and in what extent .
for the respective property , a san@@ itation is also registered in the base book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann myself will once again come to emotion and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel empha@@ sized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and land @-@ bow , &quot; where it is among other things about the structural condition and the renovation inten@@ tions .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and residential ar@@ c , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only necessary to fill in the building premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note , Got@@ zel showed that a complete questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still empha@@ sized that the distribution of convey@@ ors after the &quot; wind @-@ counter &quot; function - who comes first comes first .
there is no funding available for later . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; town centre II &quot; were shown to make the presence of a renovation &quot; tasty . &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip to come to house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country to open the door with a micro@@ chip to enter his office and can even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology through its company bio@@ te@@ q .

the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle .

the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises US manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which were left to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is aboard , was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American construction programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Senior officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter in Connecticut was produced in Connecticut near a yacht of Maine , a fire @-@ w@@ rench from Wisconsin and a fork lift .
the military office of the White House asked the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the record of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for operation of helicop@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only wanted you to be aware , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to its su@@ peri@@ ors , Deputy Commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long stayed until the lawn stayed between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew for the return flight would be needed .
the original flight was lodged during the event during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
from the records of the TIM@@ E , records are not clear , whether a second flight was needed .
the Hatch Act prohi@@ bits the federal government to use government property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could be inf@@ ring@@ ing the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked if it was an inf@@ rin@@ gement of the Hatch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was called the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a violation of the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and propag@@ ated efforts to penet@@ rating government regulations .
the use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically beneficial purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump introduced an investigation as the presidential candidate in front of his first Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ r@@ all@@ ye campaign in Melbourne , Florida , Taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that character@@ ize via the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is excited by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy collector of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn across to susp@@ end the US president in the White House with precise Zen@@ ics .
at the beginning of July , when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 training courses in the White House 58 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirement for the month , said a official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units were flown in an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support com@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were not the burden of any other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in order to exp@@ ose the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have any bud@@ get@@ ary drawings for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ary of the US Defence Ministry for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D expenditure for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight @-@ hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the naval base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia in Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for operation of helicop@@ ters are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers lying on the basis of estimates for generating sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , replacement par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s for DO@@ D are not included in personnel costs , but take into consideration the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
the former press pre@@ acher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have been working ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is reasonable to lift up this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire blowing .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky , and the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the last kit@@ a@@ year 2800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; by now , not only children , the 45 week@@ days are taken care of , in the Kit@@ a at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial @-@ time professionals from September 1st , kitchen service : you can warm the supplied meals , add them to salad , raw food and fruits , slic@@ ing the meal individually , give food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a kit@@ a , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ floor facilities - decides on the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen helping now belong to the Kit@@ a team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
&quot; the children should help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force ans team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the Kit@@ a , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important to the children .
the cleaning of the Kit@@ a rooms - now also the task of the kitchen forces - will now be carried out by special cleaning staff .
this version - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power , it also has the charm that it turned out in the cost @-@ comparison between self @-@ reg@@ aining and foreign policy for the city as the most economic position .
and that , although 46 partial forces are re@@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those hours fall at around 750 persons in the educational field not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says UN
elections can only be representative , when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , acting leader of the UN Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women are identified in the provinces of the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women are unlimited and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban have released threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international mar@@ tial arts to an advisory role .
this year , elections for the first time will be peaceful peac@@ efully from a democra@@ tically elected government .
Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will still boost Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success .
the Afghan independent election committee reports that 1.2 million women have registered millions of voters registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concerns over investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to be found in managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ ite manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie at the long @-@ term commitment to production in the Glasgow factory .
G@@ MB Scotland said , I have held the company about the future of investments in the Toll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work at work in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties Ow@@ ner said that he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to learn when their activities would change .
in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ alle@@ ite of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express &quot; concerns that financing production lines are not pre @-@ powered . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can gain the general @-@ site manager to gain clarity over the future needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross .
generations of families have worked here and the workers were strongly concentrated on the local community and the large @-@ room Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social discrimination .
hence , under the perspective of employment , wage and prosperity , and from the back@@ side of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing civil service costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow , ur@@ gently need a prosp@@ ering production compensation for Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ite on Toll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in Toll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate as all the companies that are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , our business continuously - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
it added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the legacy of Toll@@ cross as production site and completely . should our business processes change at the location , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the site of La League may regret her interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti regret
Paris Saint @-@ Germain did not leave in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after spending an offer of £ 189 million , to dissolve his free @-@ air demand , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the double of the previous brand , Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season .
after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar will be the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sports@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way , such as N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way to outside , although the club has always given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 to take care of him .
but was the football world three years ago from the PS@@ G president ahead of this view ?
when Manchester City has been interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried about it when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
but if they try to sign a member of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G middle @-@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of her price offers to N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report un@@ load pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report to the abuse of abuse was Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ ject sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to discussions .
Christian Weis@@ sman , spokes@@ man of the reform movement , &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German Press Agency , he expected from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , a excuse .
it would like to serve the appearance of the Catholic Church when Mu@@ eller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own under@@ ings or their then wrong assessment of the processes .
by contrast , the Vatican Chancellor , Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , critic@@ ised , however , critic@@ ised that coverage was measured with &quot; two measures . &quot;
in respect of the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it would have to be sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds , &quot; but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ eth@@ ics Committee .
&quot; the hab@@ it , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion on keeping it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you are happy to be on the church and this is a fallen fres@@ co@@ y . &quot;
in addition , she pointed out that in their youth &quot; b@@ lows have been a normal ped@@ ago@@ gic agent , &quot; to be ready for children , as I was one . &quot;
they are un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often di@@ pped .
completely in@@ justice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger read the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sees the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ant lawyer Ulrich Weber has presented ?
altogether 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s . &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ ans were sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , it &apos;s called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it sum@@ mon@@ ed that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister has been applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence .
especially with a high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be heavy .
in contrast to numerous other custo@@ dian , many victims , however , inv@@ ests the general humanity by R. estimated and thus in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ chiev@@ ous sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the &quot; Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; there is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for the one , many students lift up his &quot; humanity . &quot;
in the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became a fuel hand@@ gr@@ ate when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has not brought any top performance .
how do you take this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one needs to be wonder@@ ing why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it .
it is just once eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of each sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or contribut@@ ors in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its own sphere .
one cannot pron@@ ounce it either , too late or have the first impression not taken seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respondents &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents itself as &quot; warm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sin@@ c@@ ere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as extremely ben@@ evol@@ ent teachers who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , biscuits , and Bon@@ b@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which also led to whales .
that he did not only cra@@ ck up with chairs and the key Con@@ federation on the ground , but also ear@@ nest @-@ par@@ ted guys in the hair or ears , he has been granted himself even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed .
to its honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods in the fra@@ il period , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents as with teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced that in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ high school .
compared with what it is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violence on the pre@@ school , are independent bag@@ at@@ ellen .
so , one wonders whether it has not been to do with his friend and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just fell on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him still are still eager .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the context of the report , there was a lot about mis@@ use about the topic of mis@@ use at the Dom@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also have any processing or contribut@@ ors with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never wanted to speak to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one covered representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem when enligh@@ ten@@ ment of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not listen to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a cho@@ ir@@ master , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... not a case in which it had been reck@@ oned by ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) , and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
I hold it ... even for really absurd , accept that it is equivalent to him ... be@@ et@@ ru@@ ding or clear@@ er or more , as opposed to their parents , intern@@ ship , confidenti@@ ality , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance to the affected pupils and / or their environment , the study could not be confirmed as part of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from any participation .
so it cannot be accused of having taken him or brought him to the display .
therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contra@@ di@@ ous crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases .
in the media , a lot of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; was reading in the shelves of the after@@ math .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of &quot; directions &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and men@@ ded to a giant mil@@ king of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly that is a mis@@ use of the report .
there will be clean separated : between the pre@@ school and high school of the Dom@@ sp@@ ar school , between sexual abuse and violence and , let &apos;s say no other .
it has also been treating inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , i.e. from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had not been ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which child of sa@@ disti@@ lled teachers were gover@@ ned and painted , they all have happened at the primary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled .
but with those Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
on that , like most witnesses , the subject of &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; para@@ dies &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but there is no sa@@ disti@@ cal violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims are estimated to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and therefore , in many cases , despite violence even positive memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation remains , at the most not even the accus@@ ation .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time , in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish herself and from the predec@@ essors on a school which he just didn &apos;t work and responsible for anything ( as the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
do Georg R@@ atz@@ inger swallowed up the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um who even re@@ produced the report .
it suggests that in this point he still has practic@@ ed the test penalty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in view of the threat of negative press distribution , he recommended penet@@ rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was banned as test sentences in Bavaria .
before that they occurred in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows us .
there was also hard to estimate , where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dramatic and where the permissible border had been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say , he would have looked away .
that is just not true .
only in 1980 the examination for schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed to be un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational standards for the time of time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger , the past to judge according to today &apos;s moral measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princ@@ ess has already been right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is , of course , not for sexual abuse , who was ab@@ h@@ ein@@ ous at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school on Resistance and violence against innocent nursery boards , that goes far beyond that time .
this is all very horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally re@@ working .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means for discipl@@ ines and punishment , i.e. ear @-@ ons and ears , were widespread in the 1970s , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also stri@@ pped himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his current time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given the talks to you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of a test penalty also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ ades played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I never conce@@ aled that he led a strict regim@@ ent there .
but this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without which demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would have hardly been possible to him to form a institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t make any big voc@@ alist and a great success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ emp@@ ow@@ ment .
what kind of man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and beyond that I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger over really well and always experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep believing and heart@@ felt people , from which you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something of a fly .
I would be a regular basis with how many former Dom@@ pads are still getting ready to contact him today , 23 years after his embar@@ k , visiting him - he &apos;s almost blind - and it is like a member of her family .
those who didn &apos;t forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ ades are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music .
and that he always was a good , vag@@ ue teacher , a str@@ ingent father , sure that may be - but also a lov@@ able resp@@ ect@@ ful being , to whom they still have a look and they are almost confused .
and please , once more clearly : all that one acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda .
we can be happy that we have been overcome this time .
but it &apos;s highly un@@ fair , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has a more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin @-@ goat .
there is the bad intention that stands behind it , just too obvious .
for the report which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its , and no one knows that nobody ever wanted to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ asses , finally in peace .
