<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your glance into the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish-institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small husbandmen manage the inflamed reason of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map Münche promotes exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows who had to be exciting, because the car-Navi held a green meadow instead of a stray road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the geoportals in Bavaria of state government, are all other than currently - but just therefore very elaborate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is then clear how cities and communities have changed in the area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a bentine carpet, which one can not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great transition card, for cities and municipalities were more detailed maps, so called judgments, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French army of Army occupied Bavaria within the Second World War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted a review about the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bayerns on behalf of course - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops entered the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Authority.</seg>
<seg id="19">The judgments of Munich, dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruit / today is the most impressive example of the capital's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is undergone, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was built for 21 years after the map, thus 1877, the Munich district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, saucer is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of the signatories are focused on today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers' uprising against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, you can see nothing as fields - at first glance: when Hineinzooming appears a small-piece card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered flurpieces from the so-called "Urs" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Little plots there are no farmers anymore - but small gardener in the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area distinguishes itself north of the foreverling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 Place of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete waste.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the judging of the journal Au-Haidhausen, one reads only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the pitch "at the fan" - but also in great letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once again locked people with madmissions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irvine was created "On the Auer Lüders."</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the establishment of this psychiatrist, who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was most advanced for his time and ended the chains of so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the staff to turn violence against the passengers, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county road in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">There are now young people living in Munich in Munich on the area of the former Auer institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and turned it into a youth hostel with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">Situated to the west of the TSV Munich East, east-east of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - in architectural design to the origin of the Irvine, which had been destroyed during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "Head square" in 1856, the purchase of the department named "Kaufinger Lane."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change carried out the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out in December 1944, and many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a chapel in the Middle Ages were once again at the Marienhof at the Marienhof, where these days take place on 5 April 2017 on the ground-breaking ground for the second S-Bahn circuit.</seg>
<seg id="49">You can compare the old Munich map with the air image of today - and fill the hole in the Marienhof hole.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights agreement publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for promoting Farties has issued a warning for colored people who are travelling due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the State of Missouri, which is scheduled for August 28, 2017, demands afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to travel through the state as a number of fragile, racial abuse during the last time in the entire State, and stated here," says it's in the opinion of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discriminating criminal matters, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, prompted the group to release the itinerary, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of the civil rights to happen to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">They will be stopped due to their skin color, they are defeated or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we haven't heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances of the beginning of the year after having no gasoline had taken a petrol and taken by the police by Missouri by the State of Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report on the Office of the Missouri "Office, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff, inform us what could happen in Missouri," "" "Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring Cautious money or their relatives to travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 Hasselt in the year 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's anti-crime fiction program, which caused the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The itinerary is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for living or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states agreed to arrest the local criminal prosecution, to arrest people due to immigration laws, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further carcinogens.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings will usually be issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue throughout the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group, Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture in front of them.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Recruyard of the family Schwendemann met together representatives of the fishing bacher CDU-Resands together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first bestows some insight into his operation, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods, 40 cows dairy cows, as well as many kittens and houses in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black Forest" milk is for him the alternative marketers for the milk of his cows, so Schwenndemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">In the table of the Feria comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach, he described the fence project as "elemental important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not win on dertype steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space is for a lot of work, and much must be edited with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have been talking here with the terms and the topography" "", "stressed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and management this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even though it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the deceptive project and is glad about the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "you hope that the request of the surfaces could be pulled out for a while." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and doing thoughts as they continue to continue their operation," "" "emphasised the Mayor" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "the farmers are often in criticism" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013 a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open surface area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be stopped by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 Euro, half of leader was promoted, and a quarter contributed to the community's fishing community.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, farmers love 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of turnouts.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a good job, without farmers and land women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter White:" "" "the best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscaping flexgerie (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows state support of women fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr recorded conveyors.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosure may not be worse (slope above 35 per cent) and must be threatened by acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="95">The motion of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence in 2018 for the fishing bacher Weidecaunfence 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open space is equivalent to 35 hectares, the cost-calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans also appreciate these, like any other - hence the sorrows-staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologist of the Trump-regime, certainly did what he did when he had a symbolic axe in a hot conflict with Jim Acosta of CNN, regarding the suggestions of President to drastic change of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of possessions and Liberty Imiters would have smynched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his basis.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller chose Acosta:" "" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that makes the world enlightened." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller lies objectively correct, but as he formulated himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It's about the contemportive words of Lazarus, the only ones who invites one state not only any old immigrant, but the poor of the poor: "your garbage, your poor, / your thronged masses, which are longing to breathe freely, the elbows of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "eleventh apostasy" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death on the basis - were very good that they did a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an unused classic.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed these importance: in their poem, the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this back to the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The Great Schreihas Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010, that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservative, the American flame was moving into the world: "lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh has been quite uncommon here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they saw from the exhausted, ending, but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and make a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is, of course, not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever wish to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch is not to enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two Schott belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance of the athletics of the UK, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship title "will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland she has developed something special, and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn about it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it," "" "said Black." ""</seg>

<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew But.de - which was elected to Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the team's team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their chapter speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or who, wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eiliie came quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, which will compete at its fifth world championships for the 400 m hurdles, says it is "incredibly" that 16 Schott are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another piece that is to be observed after a great season, which was the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">He remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team capitals says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also in the medals and the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"" "" "" "we are so special about team capitals that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and voted for me, it will be something very special for me" "", "she added." ""</seg>

<seg id="155">What my speech denies as capturing?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it was good.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home world championship.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: don't throw yourself to a public office if you do not tolerate the voters of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the Domestic Policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He hurried at criticism, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we will lead the sheep to the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to read Larry Hogan, who needs to work more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained that this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governors "headquarters sent the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a return reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as a primary means to join with his voters and play his hairless head on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who are on the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially called and of employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the comments of the comments are nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too simple to use the image of lead or mover or water-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments respectfully, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest renounced the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, MD, was not fulfilled, but she asked for Hasselt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news," "" "she wrote in the comment field of news" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't like that idea if a number of people is on the same subject, then they will be disregarded by some more than a so-called collective deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">What the employees of the Governors described as "concentrated spam attack," would probably call "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking one critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous time when you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical conductors, to burn and bring protesters to arrest or silence.</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials who criticises that he has chosen Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is lamented by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question came in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, the last Aventment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, appointed a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers showed up between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters beat on his guidance.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Belisarius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters of newspapers, the Washington decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticise his position on the treaty of Amity, trade, and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents that were collected by the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-year-old-era (as the pioneer of David Wain and Michael Showold the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV shoot), and for himself - this means for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era (permanent memories).</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a Franchise, it feels like it would be short.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not only because of his absurd humanist (it contained a original story for a promising canned vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>

<seg id="1190">At one point, a character is characterized by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skating and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showold), now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant Plot, which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showold) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good successful impression of Michael Ian).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As usual, the courses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's moustache of "singles," whose ex-Man-on-Camp Andy is now like an old backers.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments that could preheat this franchise like a sort of repeated "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I see as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," on the film "Atomic Blonde" and even on "Glow" with its East-West-West-Iconography.</seg>

<seg id="1204">And the list of famous spokespersons - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Finde'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda Dramas - a murderer that bears a Reagan-mask is included - that it often plays as a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it attracts attention, and the comedy isn't fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," which was edited on a lower length, could provide his Agitprop Satire better, da Gregor and Iosef once again visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a heap of hamburger.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico is reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even better course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first day of working with the head of the White House, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would meet better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnose makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his medical device.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps refers to television as a few decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when the candidate was angry for a fair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him," "" "said the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February opposite poltico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key, Trumps Twitter habits under control, according to six former election campaign officials, to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps twitter-habit ever was "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps tweets would contain even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to relieve him some times, anger from him, then their effort was worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has to prevent it consistently, that Trump controversy evokes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people work in a white house that will always try to put together their own agenda by introducing trump material, which may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - entirely dealing with this story - reported on the preference of preference for strategic reasons for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump-officials said that Trump is able to respond to negative press excerpts, especially those with damaged leaks, and to find out how these come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Just that happened at the end of February, when someone told the president of malignant a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff of Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of" at the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter, or that he has not offered some specific evidence, or that he has made false accusations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage the paperwork and document the pump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts to do the same for three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his advisors are still striving to influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make the Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also accepted more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the Special Representatives Trump personally plowed into the centre and undertake care of whether the President may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand lawyer's main task is to examine and decide whether the accusation should be charged.</seg>

<seg id="1520">This was divided by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institut for Polar- and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion tonne of heavy and 5800 square kilometres is now run into the north and will probably have two, three years until he has melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">It is a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest kingfisants who have registered in the past three decades.</seg>

<seg id="1524">To the extent of climate change, climate change played a role in the outbreak of the ice, is unclear according to research.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collars in the region for some 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a facsimile background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to the opinion of many researchers, it could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Now the broken column has been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelcows.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelcows swims on the sea and is peaked by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is always growing into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcows is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this Schelfeises the equilibrium of waxing and abrupture was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Scheleon was broken there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">It is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelcows are in danger, because the front edge have never been withdrawn so far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Additionally, the ice plate stand under stress and can fall apart, if there is a piece of breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelcows and Eisberg rises the sea level, as they swim on the water and pushes for so much water as it adds to the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of Schelfeises causes that the glaciers flow right into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level, but only in small dimensions, writes the British research project to the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelcows is the fourth largest in Antarctica, with an area of nearly 50 000 square kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">The move from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick, and the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural event and not a direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists be controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelcows go back again, and possibly summed up, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though this researcher did not withdraw this gigantic iceberg to change the climate change, so in the past decades, however, many kingdoms of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long zipper of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data on the research program British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic peninsula has decreased 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula have already warmed around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus tamed up to the areas in which the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1615">This also recognized the first federal ligaverages that increasingly engage in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">In early 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, founded an E-Sport Division and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under the contract, one could be even more often present on these markets, than just once a year, to send federal membership to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What's all about it?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation of FIFA on unfair competition.</seg>
<seg id="1628">Long ago, as in normal sport, Lists have long established themselves to compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And by 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobatic too has dealt long with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and many biological and physical reactions show that you find also in the classic sport, for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Besides, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response capability.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only work on the console, but also exercise their bodies and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But the acrobatic sees problems: "doping is becoming more and more."</seg>
<seg id="1638">Inspections are difficult during online games, and in the scene the structures of classic Sports are missing.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by the Deloitte Group consulting and the German Association's Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth ahead of the E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, more than 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsorship and great tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga, that is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultant.</seg>

<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her friend through lyrics and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years have been abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted of Conrad Roy in June, because of the death of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1667">Carter would remain free to appeal.</seg>
<seg id="1668">She was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representative argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness.</seg>
<seg id="1669">In red pants and a cream-coloured blouse, Carter stood up with tears in his eyes, folded hands and downwards eyes when she was condemned.</seg>

<seg id="1674">But Carters said, "It was a terrible circumstance that she regret her."</seg>
<seg id="1675">Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, he did not find out that her "age or Reigegrad or even her spirits could have a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">A public prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mutter Lynn Roy who said that "there is no day in which I do not betwither the loss of my beloved Son.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a lawless precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another, suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention, after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang on, spring from a building, Depeche yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages sent them in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the eyes of his suicide, she wrote: "you have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything that you must do is to turn the generator, and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has shared legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender plant is declining due to Dürre's conditions and due to the diseases transmitted insects, what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, getting great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender plant in Provence is effective because the plant was exposed to climate change during the past years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a little cicade, a microbacterium, the booted kwarf, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered in consideration are a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the floor, but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water, and the development of sorts, which are more dryness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce meet normally on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt civil servants and unaudible drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shade of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: you should take their children to the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades, or leaving them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have three words written on a board on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug fisherman, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and throughout the country the bodies are frequent, there are more journalists at the same time: at least 25, since president Enrique Pena Nieto left his office in December 2012. 589 lives in attacks and threats from Bundesschutz und until now there were at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, the editor and their inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder, Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt, although its presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his midfinger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop will take place less than two months after his death and the orters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">A special Attorney of Attorney was built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, according to the Committee of Journalists, to the Protection of Journalists only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are associated with drug trade and organised crime, the killers of journalists are only rarely faced.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still consist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intreast, and although the terrain is still more defamously.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting point for the security of safety, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time to waste in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we know why we know all things." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the paper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove out in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left one woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to walk around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But Valdez's theme is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the surrender in the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decor, two-story mouths of drug royal, which are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt because he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First published in February the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival boxes in the war with Guzmans sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have been annoying, presumed gear members bought each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake had not to force Valdez, following the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same history, leaving the country to its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues were aware that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroste in 2003 when he joined the founding of five colleagues at the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 USD.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without pressing the rocket problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">With the time, the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising participated.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it, hard run tests without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication, in which they could read stories that nobody else had to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">After eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever they lead them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to go on," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you must take the job taking place as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">I would not be asked: "what did you do about so many things? why did you not say what went before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse as a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar over the office, go and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for a routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to ask their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it, if you are dealing with their women, their children, their clean shops, their home and runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-determination and self-keeping.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuters, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where employees arrived from Riodoce to security training, suddenly no mobile phones are allowed. days earlier was known that Spyware that was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside the heat, two policemen were looking outside the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-sized building in a mid-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who described the Governor itself as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug may be under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce took place on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the former poet Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé on the state spending, focusing on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group built in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug retailers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public notes that the restaurant registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption because of high-caliber cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">In Villarreal asked the reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman had escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have watched the column of Valdez, as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body-fit.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, dedicated to the killings of journalists, dedicated because the employees have become something that they never expected, activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez hiked a few signs and went to a demonstration on a demonstration due to another journalist for the Office of the Office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the Western State of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become more popular throughout the country by writing them in organised protests, "SOS Press" on walking routes and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez departed in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to liberate journalists and kill them because they have told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">It has since then asked that it is regrouped from the government because it is worried that her anger has injured their objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly mentioned that journalists in Mexico of organised crime, involved in government officials and a valid company. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug media, but also on orders of politicians and security forces, who raised the organised crime under a blanket.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "the media group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "recorded more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "you'll die in Mexico because they want you to hold your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the Morde have a deterring effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody knew the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headsets were beside her seperated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close the paper El Norte at the northern border state Chihuahua, following the assassination of the correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continues, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo, after the assassination of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly established the drug-style with an article on the front page with the heading "What do you want of us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home states or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who continue to stay and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Ibarra who once wanted to be a poet, is said that drug dealers are frightened it.</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce at the pavement took place in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sums up.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shooting with bandry and security forces near the seaside Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1926">The report in the journal "Current Biology" described it as "the preserved dinosaurs, which has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved condition has researchers to describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic is the armored plant carnivores the best known fossil its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of the surrounding rock out of the place, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered that was sent to the Royal Tyrrell museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy traffic.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all of these hard work the ready result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you have blinded a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," "" "said the principal actor Caleb Brown, scientist of the Royal Tyrrell museum, where the creation is to be seen." ""</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this plant eaters, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a driven tank, probably threatened by meat-eaters dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a parachute that is used as counterbursement, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">It would have been allowed to mix well better in its surroundings and soften his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the family of Nodosaurier, made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum techniques Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns and the shape of scales and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the conshaded, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta are by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs was hunted by the carnivorous dinosaurs by flesh, that the evolution of the confrontation was favourable as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, which are entering the conshady - think of deer, zebras or arthroes - are much smaller and vulnerable to prey, which was signalized that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs roar of the chalk time must have been," Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on hints about his life, including its Conserrated Darmintes to find out what it had eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river and pushed into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurier is truly remarkable, because it is covered completely with preserving skin, but remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is that the animal looks almost as much as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you have a little bit of your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, which were on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although King of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was sank after death in the sea and in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the Museum, it is the manned Dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the thigh.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 feet) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips, which raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant eaters was pushed by Western Canada, until a flooded river was flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good that the Hautreste always cover hollowed tank plates along the dinosaur</seg>

<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket standings without a conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to use these, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to be booked an online ticket - what we have to do in most passengers already.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You have to have bought it via the app by train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "Comfort Check-in" works: one climbs to the train, calling his ticket under "My tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customers then appears a button for the electronic standings.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train drivers receive a message on their mobile devices that the gast X is in the train and has taken the booked seating area Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train guide comes to number Y, he knows that a passenger is already already set up on a passenger online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the trains - which is to take advantage of the passengers.</seg>

<seg id="2010">This enables the passengers to create their travel time in the train, "says Michael Peterson, Marketing-Managing Director of DB.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Second plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs."</seg>
<seg id="2012">Who often drives trains, knows that next to late and changed trains the ticket controls are among the greatest troubles.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, in any case, one of the participants do not need all the documents you need for the evaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or a document that you have to advance.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train drivers and drivers, which leads to bad mood in part or large-room and delays in control of your own tickets and the Schaffner at the end the time takes care of taking care of the other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to study the answer to question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core on August 9, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrollout by Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post by somebody from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police had just killed an 18 year old child, and it's still on the street," "" "said it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, since no one else had posted information on her feed, she finished Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the field of St. Louis was with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of browns leblosem body that was expelled on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell was thinking.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She made her mobile phone to go to Tweet on the Canfield drive later on the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people, the screaming, and from a man who claimed that Browns to be a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed at which a policeman stand in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, another policeman shout and cried, "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"it is not usual," Ferrell remembered her testimony.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and we can call it typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 o'clock she fetched her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary movie "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, the power and loss of power, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of men who live in the community and filled the streets to ask answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell's daughter, who carried a flower dress and a fine crown, came to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she reminded of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we go now to Ferguson because the police killed an 18 year old boy, and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I couldn't take it away," "" "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what is happening now is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and see it and be tucked up.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also know the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have good luck to give her an experience in which she does not experience any ecatant racism, it is not different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I have the feeling I would like to point out her a bad service, to keep it far off." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which was waiting for a campground when the activists on the possible non-accusation of officer Darren Wilson were waiting.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter worked together with a local businessman who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to accept a new species of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism has changed after 9 August," "" "she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black congregations." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan evening demonstration, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came from Ferrell's sense:" "" "will you document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from the whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently declared in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew, have not centred their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for its activism around Todestract occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us." "" "we speak," "" "said Davis." ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me as these people will be represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is not a "Messiah" movement, but for a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells lives, as she loves herself and marry her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understand that there must be certain danger at this work, and in the realization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenage dog Trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "so we are constantly fighting in different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to observe that "the movement is truly held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not a affirmatic type of action," by the turally due to its identity as the heart of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person who shook her energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's no coincidence, even though it was at the forefront, because in a life on these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much on the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, the message records in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racist links between the congregation and the police continue to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to blocking a motorway with a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless they clert itself to a singing and she has committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "Megaahn": TV-readers discuss with bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although they are still not built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre in the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the people in supporters and opponents since the first presentation.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the subject is hardly possible.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "while the one of the bit Gallery says:" "" "that would be a dream" "" "(Anja Becker) or" "" "This would be a dream" "" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "" "no man" "" "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" "" "size!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers in the city, including the rest of the other business, fear the opponents that the pedestrian zone should bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the grounds where the farm market stands, where 13 direct marketing products are offering their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">Construction work will be concluded with the start of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "we have been selling nearly weekly in the farm market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the landlady always happy again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We discovered the butcher shop for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that, during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">The small market hall in Frankfurt is very interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the level of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But this should probably not be low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is your shopping street in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular week market, it is more important that at least the market stands at least remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered here is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is very inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping centre only of larger firms, because the local owners are often not portable.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farm market place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - also in duration if the bit gallery will actually come true.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it bring the Spectst bit gallery already before, to drive all the shops from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And shopping center that is empty, no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">For my opinion, it would have been better to promote a proper peasant market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farm market place, yes, thanks to the insane many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more place.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching resemblance: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the center of the fridman Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white, black and brown, that are almost invisible - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircut, which you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst started a 35-year sentence after having publicly designated diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and landmark disco, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created the DNA analysis of the DNA which could look from Manning and made from the 30 portraits, such as someone else can look with these genomic data - the many wise men as they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, born as Bradley Edward was born, but had been spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">By the prison the picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is intentionally sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a flat blonde perforation - which she was associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg originated from the great success of their 2012-project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette jack and chewing gum by extracts the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg declared in a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so they contacted Contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were not unequal to Bridging, who exterminated several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a shot of Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte Comic "Supporting Images," which would convert a future to see the President Chelly's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Mannings would release for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy acquisitions.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There are also some deep deep deep-looking at the opening of the exhibition, because Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops to find new, tweaked ways, which he should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the weird timing of all these things, she said that "things are going to pass for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a written artistic statement, Manning called for Manning with her superior signature (which "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of the "automatic destruction, whose foundation are gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall the mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological ways, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people are hopefully to take away is that our genome does not care about who we are, and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows maning as they appear with the hands of hands in the United States, such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I always get goosebumps when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it should be taken before in the comic book - but when they should do it, then it will be welcomed into the middle of the space of masks, from their own genomic simulls, who are classed as hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, allows companies to provide advice, Special groups and demographic groups, and in some cases Whistleblowern allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the board of directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they are now tools like Strava and Fitbit for prosecution of their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used to measure employees.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap polls and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows most complaints and which executives may have low consent results - so you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the forefront of the workplace culture, you do not have to be involved in scandals that has been involved in scandals since then a former employee describes a blog post which describes an environment of harassment, with those who have spoken.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire is an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, after the financial technical website let's talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent poor behaviour and identify, saw an increase in interest and activity in early this year amidst the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convert has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">How Glint lets Convercent businesses send tailor-made "Puls-" surveys, collect confidence in real time and view the warmth-maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline which can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the principal leader is involved, complaints directly to the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is badly treated or inethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee curse and gages, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent is used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures, and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company's headquarters, a formal appeal and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said it was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent stuck, problems remotely identified by managers who were in offices in cities or states were hidden - such as discrimination, harassment or less internship quicker and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Businesses began to take Ethics, Values and Employee commitment in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethic hikes due to the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right," "" "that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty clothes online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and are loaded up the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of venture capital investors, which both have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the entire capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">In November, we secured a total of $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices, and that the work you are doing is worthwhile, then you feel more strongly committed to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which is both Convercent and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio are doing well. companies run fine when employees are working and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools are third-party promise, commitment and deployment of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee involvement according to the experts of the workplace-culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks people to your feedback, it can have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or at all, it can be disappointments and motivating employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in the business management company Kotug International, who has seen company focusing on the collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow the employees," "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who has passed the monthly headpolls in now, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting the feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to organize and add multiple teams within the company and add a full service training to tackle the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always maintains a new insights over the employees, and it hopes for a long view, that leads to a better bond of workers in a industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose man, you also lose customers.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the tiny Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze-music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-15 years a siphole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his homely seat in the Mainl River valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look to the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he said the arrogant." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England "spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another, next British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book from Rhodes which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I just wrote on the thumb pressure on the side of a letter that has been written by a double-agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb pressure!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell of smoke, because then a fire lit because of light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has a effect as if it himself would be.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is working with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overrated") that seems to be true to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodos spent his days to explore the Victorian "new" castle, to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, like the monished hyenas in the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with country-care, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then he drank whiskey "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust received the full access in 2006 than the last yearbook, Elizabeth Hussey died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employee started to take care of the archive, which he said as "hundreds of years, in which Aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Aries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps, who, who owned what had said: "you could mean that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch in order to have fought two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let it go all its way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point to settle for a broader basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a tumult that occurred 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title" "" "Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex" "", "Rhodes." ""</seg>

<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are linked together? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit paterners who hidden the family Darrell seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell portrayed out of the 18th century, which filled his own funeral, filled a sarg with stones (a discovery that was made only years later than his sarg was dug up).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: 'the gentlemen seemed to be a real Gauner to always make debts, and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell male soles their debt crisis, giving rich old women, I put it to me as a heap of well-looking guys, with a talent to promote arousing. "</seg>

<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff, as earlier, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the leadership of the head, the five vice-president and ministers also took part in defence, home affairs, justice and foreign affairs.</seg>

<seg id="2346">The General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force, and the Navy were deposed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, Prime Minister Erdogan has fired 326 Generals and Admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually due to alleged connections to the movement of exile-Preacher Fethullah Gülen who sees Erdogan as a wire attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who were involved immediately on the coup attempt will act in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the day after the coup Erdogan had called the overthrow of the "divine gift" as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces. "</seg>
<seg id="2351">But has Erdogan really in handle?</seg>
<seg id="2352">In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "Unleagues in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are Besorgites for an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifest itself among other things in the lifting of the headland ban for soldier, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the big cleaners in the army and the security forces continue.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July Erdogan left another 7395 government operators, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In doing so, Erdogan was tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Generals were formerly known as the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, they defeated their role as the keeper of worldly state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan won the power of the military step by step, not least to appeal to reform of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is managing targeted Islamization of the forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," an eminent officer, who sought refuge for the coup attempt in charge of persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists in a few years."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The Ascension of Sex Robot is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robot.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot is at the moment a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotik) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robot in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotik and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and the co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their rise seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its form of nipples and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are fun, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern ropes have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can adjust its robot in accordance with his beliefs, "and then select everything from the eye-color of the robot over the form of nipples to type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But there is still more worrying, as many robots have the "personalities" that would look like a stepford-woman of progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern ropes have evolved to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are appealing such as schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion as "Frigid Farrah" which conveys the impression of relentness and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that has been adapted to your personality as good as possible," warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she has their moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">She can be tired, fixed on conversation, or can be "in mood"!</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjectively feminine qualities to rape, if you take a step on Frigid (means here: residenying) Farrah is worried, worrying a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do males then have no Roxxxy?" it is on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, this sex robot is not only a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and its increasing refinement to something darker and tithoit in our culture, to a retreat from the Ideal of Gender Equality to a wish after sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will, of course, have no sex robot, and while the FRR notices its rising popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is leakened out of the boundary, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive to give them the free market to this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed Sex robot in a time are threatened, in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which the White House has a president to have praising women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Hand maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the more closed body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The objective behind this sex robot is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their hereditary arquitecture, that they feel deserving that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, on the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robot does not represent real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can't separate or go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They do not have mediation or background history, nothing that could cause independence or anything, which could disturb the imagination of total subjugation.</seg>

<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"" "" "" "it has become a Binsenweishness of the Trump era that the policy circuits that have polarized the US electorate, even families in small format." ""</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA, with advice on how to circumvent with the horror of Trump-chosen relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all allegedly rigorously hit us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less notices is the power of trumps, families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unit can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone knows whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar at the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">In order to find the dining table, it is certainly a good thing, but it affects me in another link that this also brings significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the effective effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "Normalisation" and Trump, we refer to the spooky way that his cookies will not be repelled by one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, a more dreadful long-term scenario, to the right wing of the right wing "normalized," which appears suddenly in comparison to his standards as the epitome of neglionableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urgency version - the dog on the Autodach, which saw 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax explaining) - both compared to Trump in fact occur as a very mild offender.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans can only be mentally healthy to qualify as an unmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Karussel of the New York Parkdepartment, and the top three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bangy and the animals rotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music gives this a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a town disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city becomes a dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not throughout the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the themes-pub-Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magic experience, because here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on and everyone had a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I had given the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked them afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to get the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the cargo.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to a slowdown, which should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was primed, while I was tired of experience, having made my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius advanced with chest pain from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the jail for a hospital for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of schiavo, which he suffered from prison agencies according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal against the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed stewards in the early morning of the Valentine's day in 2013, by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius alleged that he held his girlfriend for a night-like intruder, which hidden in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this year against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appel by which they say they are too transparent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National prosecutions Authority reported that it will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meats, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (oral formulation)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study concludes exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United States in the United States, causes stomach cramps and petals, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins work to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide inside the food is not allowed to enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, who are able to destroy inflammation, are balanced out of cells who promote tolerance and protect the body without damage the sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is inclined toward inflammation, it may result an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments we found that a type of tolerance stimulated immune cell in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had their immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bomilieus, when the same system also helps people with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan seeking a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was separately housed, this did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference in the intestinal microbiosomes had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of the mice were sequenced DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice that were lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment, so that a intestinal microbiom was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria used on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a liquid and then brought small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component of the liquid is cleansed, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol 3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan have been halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect them in our gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans like in mice, but defects in genes on tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The evolution of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2644">This was also true - and everything was much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a stagger, the Düsseldorf-Plea pretente the party.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Comrades took the comrades in the weeks after that.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then when they had exhausted all the courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next descent.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD landslide, lost his Nimbus for the weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burnt.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because he made everything wrong in the crisis communication, so quite all that you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz fights for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">So now Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW-exhaust gas emissions and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Anglo-Saxon prime minister had already been criticised in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Miese removals came up.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or maybe because, in the past few weeks, Weil tried to keep the league in Akzente.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Comrades of the former civil master from Hannover to build his power in Berlin, comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz remained unhidden.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him give, because they spoke of because a stabilising of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Because of this, because of the adherence, the Lower Saxony is basically no fault.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz not even at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">At times, comrades therefore endeavoured to keep his own ranks.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their anger is set up on the green, and above all on the backsliding parliamentarians in the west.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and more democratic, like Mrs Tjackets her own career-eating over the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, chief of the party leaders in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the editorial network Germany (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Mrs Tire has not been elected to Parliament because of its person as a direct candidate but on the state list of the Lower Saxony's Green Party.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns their mandate.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Anyone who wants to renovate his years, can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Informed about Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of city development on Wednesday in sensation.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Schindler returned to date at the beginning of the information event.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been in sensitisation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the restoration area II from 2005 to 2016, the net income fell by still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is lastly important to promote the internal development, and not only build new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, we received information from the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, that there will be a renovation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The amount of funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which £500 Euros from the country, the rest of the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="2681">What is a renovation area then?</seg>
<seg id="2682">One will continue to investigate, so Schindler continues to investigate where the "really old" houses are.</seg>
<seg id="2683">It also plays a role, whether in the planned area of any interest, to renovate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area limits could then move again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The remarks on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Cellar presented the contents of the federal states program "Social town," in which frame would then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalisation of interior teams, improving the living and working conditions and receiving and expansion of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The restoration area would eventually be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval process for the funding is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, it would only be carried out until September this year, as part of those involved in the restoration area involved a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the amendment will be made to begin with the renovations next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">After that, Pietzschmann declared that every Commune had to carry on the allegations of investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is therefore, to evaluate the urban abuse of abuse and to decide when it is renovated and in what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective property, a sanitation is also registered in the base book.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann myself will once again come to emotion and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized, an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires who will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land-bow," where it is among other things about the structural condition and the renovation intentions.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey questionnaire, the "household and residential arc," data can be made to size, distribution and residents of a housing.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"" "the blue" "" "Operation" "" "is only necessary to fill in the building premises." ""</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, to note, Gotzel showed that a complete questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">Moreover, new measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler still emphasized that the distribution of conveyors after the "wind-counter" function - who comes first comes first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">There is no funding available for later. "</seg>

<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House asked the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the record of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit which is responsible for operation of helicopters.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew for the return flight would be needed.</seg>

<seg id="2724">From the records of the TIME, records are not clear, whether a second flight was needed.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits the federal government to use government property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave a violation of the reform of the health reform, which was underway in the Senate, and propagated efforts to penetrating government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically beneficial purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMx-1 does not have any budgetary drawings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain did not leave in their persecution by Neymar, after spending an offer of £189 million, to dissolve his free-air demand, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the double of the previous brand, Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the most affordable professional sportsmen in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry about the way, such as Neymar has forced its way to outside, although the club has always given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 to take care of him.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world three years ago from the PSG president ahead of this view?</seg>

<seg id="2872">"we respect all the clubs.</seg>
<seg id="2873">But if they try to sign a member of our players, this will have consequences. "</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG middle-fielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by taking one of her price offers to Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report unload pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The "" "" the "" "" Regensburger Domspatzen report to the abuse of abuse was Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misject scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weissman, spokesman of the reform movement, "We are church," stated after the publication of the German Press Agency, he expected from the former Regensburger bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, a excuse.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would like to serve the appearance of the Catholic Church when Mueller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own underings or their then wrong assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">By contrast, the Vatican Chancellor, Osservatore Romano, criticised, however, criticised that coverage was measured with "two measures."</seg>
<seg id="2895">In respect of the encroachments in Regensburg, nobody doubt that it would have to be shameful and shameful deeds, "but the" degree of medial manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion on keeping it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you are happy to be on the church and this is a fallen frescoy."</seg>
<seg id="2898">In addition, she pointed out that in their youth "blows have been a normal pedagogic agent," to be ready for children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often dipped.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger read the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to accept Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he sees the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report, which presented by the Bistum Regensburg with Enlightenant lawyer Ulrich Weber has presented?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s. "victims of overprint, 67 Domspans were sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it's called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it summoned that Domkapellmeister has been applied in many cases forms of physical and mental violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with a high Emotionality the punishment for the students could also be heavy.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In contrast to numerous other custodian, many victims, however, invests the general humanity by R. estimated and thus in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the mischievous scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of Violence of Violence at the" Regensburger Domspatzen "there is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For the one, many students lift up his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">In the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist who became a fuel handgrate when a Domspatz has not brought any top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you take this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one needs to be wondering why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">It is just once eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of each suspicion of the mid- or contributors in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence at the preschool took place outside of its own sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One cannot pronounce it either, too late or have the first impression not taken seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents" "", "" "" "salvation" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents itself as "warm" "", "" "" "sincere" "", "" "", "" "", "" "", "" "" and "understandably" "", "as extremely benevolent teachers who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits, and Bonbons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high Emotionality, which also led to whales.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only crack up with chairs and the key Confederation on the ground, but also earnest-parted guys in the hair or ears, he has been granted himself even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To its honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods in the frail period, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced that in a worldly school, a state-high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared with what it is actually about in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and violence on the preschool, are independent bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">So, one wonders whether it has not been to do with his friend and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him still are still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the context of the report, there was a lot about misuse about the topic of misuse at the Domensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also have any processing or contributors with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never wanted to speak to speak with my father or my mother," "" "said one covered representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem when enlightenment of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not listen to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choirmaster, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in terms of the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... not a case in which it had been reckoned by (Georg Ratzinger), and could have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I hold it... even for really absurd, accept that it is equivalent to him... beetruding or clearer or more, as opposed to their parents, internship, confidentiality, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance to the affected pupils and / or their environment, the study could not be confirmed as part of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from any participation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be accused of having taken him or brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradious crimes, as unfortunately, in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media, a lot of "non-violence" was reading in the shelves of the aftermath.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of "directions" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and mended to a giant milking of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There will be clean separated: between the preschool and high school of the Domspar school, between sexual abuse and violence and, let's say no other.</seg>
<seg id="2951">It has also been treating incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger had not been choral director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which child of sadistilled teachers were governed and painted, they all have happened at the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that, like most witnesses, the subject of "Preschool" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradies" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but there is no sadistical violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims are estimated to be" "" "many victims" "", "and therefore, in many cases, despite violence even positive memories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">The accusation remains, at the most not even the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time, in which it was reported by the states on the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71 when he began to establish herself and from the predecessors on a school which he just didn't work and responsible for anything (as the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Do Georg Ratzinger swallowed up the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">It suggests that in this point he still has practiced the test penalty. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "already in view of the threat of negative press distribution, he recommended penetrate." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was banned as test sentences in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows us.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also hard to estimate, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatic and where the permissible border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say, he would have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examination for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed to be unfair to use today's educational standards for the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," so the danger, the past to judge according to today's moral measures.</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "" "" "the princess has already been right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">But that is, of course, not for sexual abuse, who was abheinous at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool on Resistance and violence against innocent nursery boards, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I'm glad that it is finally reworking.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means for disciplines and punishment, i.e. ear-ons and ears, were widespread in the 1970s, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also stripped himself.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his current time, Georg Ratzinger has given the talks to you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of a test penalty also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, the Domspades played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I never concealed that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without which demand unconditional discipline, it would have hardly been possible to him to form a institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and Bonbons alone, you don't make any big vocalist and a great success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-empowment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in the talks about their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and beyond that I met Georg Ratzinger over really well and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and heartfelt people, from which you can't imagine that he could only do something of a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I would be a regular basis with how many former Dompads are still getting ready to contact him today, 23 years after his embark, visiting him - he's almost blind - and it is like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who didn't forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspades are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he always was a good, vague teacher, a stringent father, sure that may be - but also a lovable respectful being, to whom they still have a look and they are almost confused.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that one accuses to him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's highly unfair, a man just because he is prominently and has a more prominent brother to make the medial sin-goat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the bad intention that stands behind it, just too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">A 93-year-old man would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits, and no one knows that nobody ever wanted to know the Regensburger Domspasses, finally in peace.</seg>
