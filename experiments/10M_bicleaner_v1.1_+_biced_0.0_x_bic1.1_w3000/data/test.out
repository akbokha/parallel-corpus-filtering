gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are stag@@ gering .
at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was seeking a little variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hunt in the quick gal@@ lo@@ ff home at home to feed .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and so the hor@@ semen ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left himself with his family over the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he would not have to leave for a photo .
it was the first time in Aachen and also with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala &apos;s Golden sport pyramid .
there is no lack of awards for the sympath@@ etic athl@@ ete .
Federal Police Cross , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen fl@@ ashed it on him .
the 18th Prize winner of the sports py@@ rami@@ de .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men the two @-@ fold U.S. mast winner was captured on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the excer@@ pts are the male Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the singer Peter Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jum@@ per Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the hand @-@ hand Erhard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports cars arrived in Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the lively company emigrated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ az@@ za cost ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger took the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ um@@ ps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - this is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential seek@@ ers are , however , in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question .
the differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
der , about the role of the state .
thus , Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against it that the state can harm the economy - with tax and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to kill the economy and regulate the economy , he says .
but he himself would be different , says Tr@@ ump .
he will reg@@ ain regul@@ ators , and it is strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses .
Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to meet , he has offered dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open , and needs money .
therefore , taxes were increased to the rich , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ shipping .
the democratic application announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics , and are rejected by the state @-@ ri@@ tic Te@@ ach@@ y @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , there could be still parties in internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and back up the coal generation in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in far @-@ protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris Climate Agreement .
in contrast with its investment programme , Clinton wants to strengthen the renewable energy and demands : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements , both competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the N@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , they do not want to sign .
at the same time , however , both the United States would not ins@@ ulate from international trade , but simply protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , for instance by Clinton .
the present wage of $ 7,@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says , The minimum wage must be , he says , he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of both camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics hold it before , so the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton likes to demand that at least from the rich men wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he looks curious with big eyes to the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she noticed that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene is normal .
until you talk with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is the division of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aid opportunities in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are whis@@ pered .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who has arrived here , on her escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars , because they are politically persecuted because of their torture or death , or because their families are sending them to Europe , &quot; she tells .
in women , there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ aling themselves secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience dealing with sexual violence , forced , Hon@@ our , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; the tugs , for example , demand a bottle of water for a bottle of water , is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that when they come to Germany in Germany , please tell B@@ ahr .
there are also women in refugee shel@@ ters often regarded as inferior and ab@@ sten@@ ance in refugee camps .
this leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich district , trau@@ mati@@ zed , it appreci@@ ates her .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so familiar that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the living because the shame is too large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help themselves , there are more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they are using a similar project , as in Munich , some answer some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are so something in the Govern@@ ments of governments not .
also in Schw@@ aben , women are not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government .
in some community settlements , sub and central fran@@ ken , there is only for women and children in some communal shel@@ ters , or their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality , &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the privacy or men and women are being accommod@@ ated together , it may be too - ongoing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower room should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel of this protection need , you can read on the And@@ re meeting in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been talking about that there is , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
veter@@ in@@ arians attacks : demands after new labour measures
representatives of Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in its disp@@ utes over a new agreement .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has required its entire Council to appro@@ ve more workforce from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have missed ministers to worry about the concerns about the contract .
in July , Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists and Medic@@ ines have voted against the jection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday night , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained quietly about problems whatsoever that the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the J@@ DC Board of Directors coordinated the proposed new contract to completely reject and calling for official new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board now set a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour measures in early September .
the disp@@ utes led to assistance in Assi@@ sten@@ si@@ sts of this year six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of BM@@ A Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , joined the re@@ jection of the agreed contrac@@ tual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he distributed BM@@ A members during the meetings that even took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists and Medic@@ ines , with that the contract should be beneficial and supposed to be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health said Jeremy H@@ unt , that the contract for physicians in England would be forced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of foreign side@@ ways &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and to proc@@ laim a official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I can not spoil myself of int@@ ru@@ cks that Ankara wants to most reconciliation most .
there was a towel , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked in@@ timi@@ dated and he has barely heat , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times .
I could not count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve themselves .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have been so ben@@ evol@@ ent than would never happen to happen .
after me , his enthusiasm rather seemed to signi@@ fy the opposite .
but one of Putin be@@ wit@@ tering , sustainable Kü@@ h@@ le showed that Russia &apos;s head of state forgot nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction : the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was decisi@@ vely bran@@ ded .
Putin has divided and accused Ankara , who fell to his back in the back .
the failure was even greater , since it was committed by a alleged friend .
it is difficult to rebuild the Vet@@ rop@@ es if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media introduced a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at once , it seemed like the Turks would bear debt for everything .
the most serious officials from senior officials accused that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the territories of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he disputed this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin was receiving the President of Erdo@@ gan , who wanted to hear .
Russia could book a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clear by hand .
Erdo@@ gan is required first of all friends that he can get after spending the last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ etat .
counter @-@ attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal occasions of the Mediterranean .
this week , the television enthusi@@ ast predicted fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agricultural imports are again permitted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West , since its reaction to the tried power demand was considered a weak answer .
for this purpose , the per@@ si@@ sting res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke that is pi@@ ping out into the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian head of state , in Ankara , won a bonus for sure that he requested a coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the attempted coup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coup &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is well @-@ noticed for Moscow is a matter of matter which , even a profound fear of regim@@ es , has changed .
the summit at this gl@@ amor@@ ous palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , an analyst who once described me an analyst &quot; Alliance of foreign side@@ ways &quot; : two countries that have been treated in the west and treated badly .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey will support both sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first talks , both pre@@ sidents were said at the press conference , that they did not take the theme once .
the President of Turkey missed it clearly on a question about their differences , while Putin chose to stress this .
there is no clear con@@ sensus on where a common N@@ en@@ ner can be found in Syria .
but after months open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster than NATO member of Turkey enjoyed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Board .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has since dist@@ anced itself almost collapsed in eight years ago and had to be saved .
during this time , brand str@@ at@@ oms &quot; R@@ BS &quot; used to protect other end@@ ow@@ ories .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds on sponsor@@ ship , six Nations Rug@@ by until Wimbledon champion Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to focus more national brands in the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the IP@@ O are changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank &apos;s brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brand , as well as the brand , under which our employees will be busy as we now become more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we have no global goals , but pursue local goals .
each of these stamps will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with customers .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing will not continue to continue , and that it will increase the per@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility of various brands in his Sport Sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop the bank of brands , because how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical prior to three years if we said we had a great bank for our customers and launched these stamps .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re@@ launch these stamps again , so I think that time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori arrives at New@@ market Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori sp@@ ends champagne after a double at New@@ market that brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit
on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British gain at the New@@ market .
he placed on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , Lester &apos;s Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat E@@ dd@@ ry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
the three @-@ day winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy about it that it was done with New@@ market because I arrived here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday night with 20.000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the cheers when he brings to victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s have achieved the milestone in the obstac@@ le race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rek@@ ord @-@ breaking career .
Lester : Pig@@ got@@ t , the Nin@@ th Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best Jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone only a few in front of him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , who differs it from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma delighted fans since years now for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago in Ep@@ s@@ om that he had already brought 6.000 winn@@ ings if he would not just be a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already lost nearly 30 years of winners , which is great .
he has a lively personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying from Flying Fin@@ ishes for Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of the British flat tree for two decades .
it was ner@@ ven@@ tional .
a number of big tur@@ ni@@ sts win , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug @-@ ban .
three years ago , at first he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to with@@ stand his doubts and return to his top shape .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori had once said that he wants to continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 59 .
Russia Putin mo@@ ist Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of the closest confi@@ dential circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport affairs .
in a position of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is that Putin has ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian President &apos;s administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been in charge of Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he graduated in the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the leader and head of government personnel .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of government to support your actions as head of state and controls on implementing your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made a mysterious man in Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time to become one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet secret services , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
in a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , here are just a few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted to the potential president once , to the Russian environmental policy - met great skep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin that &apos;s cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you to talk to this very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian President &apos;s administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people to whom he trusted in most .
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third office of Putin had tried to viol@@ ate the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally Putin &apos;s ally , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president of three and a half years later .

Queens@@ drop Cross@@ ing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion US project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Queens@@ bor@@ o cross country with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now associated with fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four super@@ vis@@ ing the &quot; deck blo@@ wers &quot; that the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge are approaching .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 balls .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion US project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown , the construction site , held a visit to the construction site today , and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of the Queens@@ bury Cross@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of a crafts@@ manship of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for pass@@ over .
a total of almost 79 % of the total bridge de@@ cks on their place and the last section of the de@@ cks gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted up at the bridge .
Michael Martin , project director of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project .
this fantastic project makes the sh@@ utter for forward @-@ looking high and deep construction .
after installation of the last road cover and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or landing page .
this was reached by pulling the northern tip bridge 700 milli@@ meters south of the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , approximately 6.000 tons weighs up and had to be pulled at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % upwards .
mend , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few milli@@ meters .
luckily , everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; fortunately still in life &quot;
three men have still lucky to be alive , &quot; after they were thrown by fishing boat in front of the fishing boat .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vince Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds have already seen the boat except their reach until we left the water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from 60 years old and was found on a boat dro@@ pping without life jacket .
they all came on board of the coastal rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the waters were un@@ injured and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had a not@@ icing that , however , unle@@ ashed the boat from the person to control the boat .
someone told us today about these men .
severely injured - man sne@@ aks onto his ex @-@ girlfriend

but she could not move it to leave the apartment .

who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : investors have to be taken a lot more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig in the coming years will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; action concept living &quot; for the next install@@ ment .
but controversy has been programmed .
first , it is about the question : who should actually build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; we are talking to the Green Party : &quot; we want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments have to be found as social flats . &quot;
the favorable apartments can , however , arise in stock .
the large troops in the town hall is , however , Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are you dealing with investors that want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at a minimum of 10 percent , but as if possible 20 percent of the apartments are building as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing project program which will cost millions and needs to be financed , shall be applied to incen@@ tives .
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Left doesn &apos;t want tough@@ ness for investors .
regardless of this , so viol@@ i , has a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
the project concept is implemented , that will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not entirely updated : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favorable apartments , whose funding will come out in the next few years ?
by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the plan@@ ing chair Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city for ongoing ties .
in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back into the price binding .
this is possible in the West town .
in one stroke can solve the problem .
because in the western town go to the end of the end Fri@@ sten .
around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
just : we don &apos;t want to have the owners , the housing societies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the Western city is dras@@ tically increased , it is removed from the aim of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of social security in just a few neighbor@@ hoods .
the Gre@@ ens add that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swoboda : Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that I have focused on more construction sites for family homes .
what does not mean , however , that not yet a compromise can be found .
Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating , as the world changes .
that te@@ ens and child do not go out to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with , on screens , was mo@@ urn over the last decade of many .
at Po@@ k@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
at the beginning , the screen was on TV , then on video games , and most recently limited to smartphones .
therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
of course , I am referring to the Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later there were created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
how many phenomena of pop@@ culture sank the interest in the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
within a few days Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon go more users than T@@ inder and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside and search for Po@@ k@@ é@@ mons that will be tra@@ cked with a GPS once they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( above a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the searches from the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps taken from the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , a app for Apple Watch , followed by the Washington Post recently informed that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by , who followed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for improved performance .
many public clari@@ fying campaigns to health , people want to bring &quot; up to 30 minutes &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; strug@@ gled on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look stunning .
however , the importance of sport cannot be reviewed .
who regularly casts sports , reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to perform it here .
but the wonderful Po@@ k@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the outdoors that makes them fun .
this way , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people close up even new girl@@ friend@@ ships .
as usual , there are also ly@@ rical toys that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone might run against a door .
what should it be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , due to Po@@ k@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ator in the real world , and will help many people in the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ no@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that immune .
dynamic on the jump horse .
effort@@ lessly on the bar .
stunning on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for combined events and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team cup A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ arians in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es at the pig bal@@ es during the single campaign of women in art at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexu@@ als of the American who wins a multi @-@ campaign and overall the fifth , while they consoli@@ date their reputation , the best of their generation or even ever .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success represents the same league as a unique athl@@ ete , such as Michael P@@ helps , who have brought her sports for new heights :
Bil@@ o domin@@ ates her sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she was &quot; the best gymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
it expected to be a final examination in Brazil , a contest that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after having won gold and silver in the single campaign of women in art at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , respectively .
Bil@@ o won the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired on the farewell party of team co @-@ ordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i as an ex@@ clamation mark .
although it existed , during their long road to the top , never planned to have the future , that &apos;s not really true .
part of their land exercises - which include her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music , at home at the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child , and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school tour in the gym hall , where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , was promoted to power .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more campaign competition since the summer of 2013 , a victory game that will hold so long as it wishes .
even if the Must@@ af@@ ina caused by two rot@@ ations , the picture mu@@ red .
Swedish bal@@ es and plant@@ ations - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - lau@@ de .
she once again took her back to 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swe@@ et@@ root - and set a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor yet another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her soft@@ ly when she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ ite - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es gloss@@ y red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection book , to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ated , called &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; by Americans , had a lead advantage .
after their soil , she threw up the audience of K@@ us@@ sh@@ es , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that was sometimes desper@@ ate .
as for Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds of the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in a car mur@@ der@@ ers shot in the car in the car
according to police reports that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girls were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade ago , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a single drive , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a towel weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder could not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting has led the investig@@ ator to become a close look , whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , mainly in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods were killed seven people within four months and two injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood before a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks have been associated and committed by the same killer .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of its injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died out on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit and listen to music in a par@@ ted car .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was abol@@ ished on an empty pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the three murders and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ances and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of its age , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of an genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create that .
I don &apos;t make that .
I didn &apos;t let me go .
what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one told us , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her husband was told that Edmund she can never recognize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutional him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that , &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund could neither sit down nor cra@@ w@@ l up to his third year and still cannot speak .
but he is making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth displays the drawing language , which Edmund for &quot; Please sing me something &quot; out of me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring it a character to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical character -- says it . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I was wonder@@ ing what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still don &apos;t know .
I have not wondered after the forecast for a long time because I didn &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with age damage caused by the Z@@ ic@@ avirus .
it &apos;s getting better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rain ra@@ ins , flood events on b@@ ail@@ out in Louisiana , Mississippi

Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used on wide parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service asser@@ ted that an additional 3 to 5 inches could fall into rain in this field .
in southern Alabama , a flood control system was deployed on Friday , while it still continued to rain in the area Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , are likely to reach a record level of this weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ flow many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream of flood in as@@ cen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , because these rivers run only slowly into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the River Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Louisiana , posted Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams are still suffering from flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the Mississippi River .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his boots , were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ver on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , is strong over night .
he said that another step p@@ opp@@ y , who lives near , warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and poured out the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it pe@@ aked my wa@@ ist .
his wife Hans@@ ford told her that she lived there in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had such a rise of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he who would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that she had rescu@@ ed all three in a great military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ver , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; von spher@@ es , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identi@@ fies it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several shots ab@@ uses , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was with his transport to the hospital .
&quot; he has done much , his small body was extingu@@ ished by bul@@ lets , &quot; divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ kon@@ z the transmitter .
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital , and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ caster , that he is likely to read again .
he would have been the first class to start a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot , two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .

cartridge sleeve for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , paraly@@ sed the crime scene .
it seems that it clearly has a lasting struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the distance , leg@@ umes were .

she recovered and the police still seeks another susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympic team in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three tur@@ ists , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired by many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lics in is round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally mirrors the US .
it has consolidated the black and h@@ is@@ pan female presence at the top of this sport .
over the past four years , number one was one of the female tur@@ ists .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion in America .
now the world was able to witness the unbelievable performance of three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas , and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she gave unexpected , yet master@@ fully Gy@@ mas@@ the@@ rout@@ ines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual combined event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but you don &apos;t see turn@@ outs throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympic Games have only four Tur@@ ns in the crew . furthermore , this is the last year with Mar@@ ta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but reality looks like that Tur@@ ns will unite the expensive sport and Turner first in private numbers that are maintained by parents , that will come up for training , education , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued to continue .
the majority of these Turn@@ around are lying in weal@@ thy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Turner will receive its entire training and that &apos;s a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started working with the tower .
we need to enable the con@@ greg@@ ations of Au@@ n countless young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym train@@ ers .
I was founded my Turn@@ halle of 20 years .
we offer free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 people urban young@@ sters ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and national and international winners .
in September , we are expanding into Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality Tur@@ ns to learn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport class and benefit .
Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymn@@ as@@ ants and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for making it so many young girls with different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance in Assi@@ sts want to organise other strikes , after having rejected Jeremy Hun@@ ting proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 Assi@@ sten@@ ologists , who voted in a vote , refused him .
in July H@@ unt plans revealed that the treaty was forced to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful .
the first assistance systems should receive a new contract , which contains modifications to night and weekly working , to improve maintenance times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mitt@@ ees for Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists held last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance to the proposed contract , in particular that it is present to heat the current occupation crisis and it is par@@ ted to treat all doctors . &quot;
at just eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts from the BM@@ A to solve disp@@ utes by talks strug@@ gled with the government to participate in the government and sometimes on o@@ int@@ angi@@ ble silence .
this was the place of one thing that Jeremy H@@ unt made about it last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; Jeremy H@@ unt must now act , raising the penetration and speak the concerns of assistance in Assi@@ sts . &quot;
if he does not do this , it is clear that Assi@@ sten@@ z@@ ologists have made clear that they are ready to carry out more labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since health nur@@ ses and specialist doctors have been involved in order to grant doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by the adoption of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week re@@ mun@@ eration for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance systems that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS staff , called for assistance in Assi@@ sten@@ si@@ sts to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures will achieve nothing but little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nursing and their families only wor@@ ries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past two months , we talked to the Committee of Assi@@ sten@@ si@@ sts and talked with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es on the concerns of the mund@@ ane and the W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers are hoping that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as horror , flexibility for training , training courses and gender pay for training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , training courses and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May were .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can lower heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks are benef@@ itted from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , after the authorities recommended to say more people for a longer period of time .
the prescribed drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for persons with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ating authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ating authority has been recommended for four years to further reduce cardiovascular problems .
some 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the arter@@ ial volumes , which form pads .
if the Bel@@ ag breaks it , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots that causes blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack .
if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through blood stream and the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons , who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is exp@@ elled under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , this risk is reduced by the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the design draft of N@@ ICE , which has been published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE health technical data center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all the persons who have suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ro@@ red consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand our treatment options to thousands of people , which can benefit from it .
information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of blood is limited to a period of up to three years . the design draft recommendation is no treatment that proceeds over this period .
culture of Political correc@@ t@@ ness makes electoral fraud bl@@ ossom in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man became the office of a government report on corruption from office in last year .
a culture of political correc@@ t@@ ness has led to clearly ignored the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities such as a devastating government account today revealed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles tells the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ houses to have evidence of poll@@ uting for eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an ant@@ in@@ corruption , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set depar@@ tures outside of voting cabins , to protect restricted voters .
he recommends that voters should take a decision to prove their identity in elections .
at the time , a voters have to name his name and address .
the report suggests , do not charge removable ink on the finger of a person if they want to give up their vote in order to prevent someone twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , Sir Eric says .
he demands that the press should have access to community records and decisions of non @-@ official comm@@ ees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial adviser , which means to protect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered from Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sk@@ ies as in the east of London .
last year , a special court decided that the re@@ ig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be cor@@ rupted by a lit@@ arian and illegal practices of his am@@ nesty .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community , in cy@@ n@@ ical way , and that he had put his critics with Rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bia to silence .
Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis that it was the cor@@ related obligation of Muslims to choose it . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the consequence of a replica , where one person cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular al@@ ar@@ ming at the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter @-@ election - where the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose one candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the voting system , including the guiding of evidence to prove the identity
in his report it means : &quot; as a proof that pressure on protection of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose from the Will of El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions could have ignored such behavior due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beliefs concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on to edit political activists letter documents to stop &quot; re@@ ap . &quot;
the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May , is also demanded tough@@ er registration tests to prevent the election directory is used to immigration and social fraud .
consider options to question voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given up her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are in@@ eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic selection .
ban that political activists edit complete local elections and env@@ elop@@ es .
the police give the powers to al@@ ign barriers to election stations .
a change of law that was charged by an accus@@ ation because of the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) facil@@ it@@ ates .
photographer in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except of Wales ) .
Inten@@ si@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees are usually going through , voters go to the voting cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls about the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; aston@@ ishing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral Court has said Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his Deputy for Lithuanian and illegal practices as un@@ tau@@ glich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons for reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ checks &quot; of the elections of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Court Orchestra in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal .
our country is known as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy according to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger - and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic sites in Rio
fans of the Olympics 2016 in Rio are this week through the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , apart from the edge and band , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ term associate of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ic@@ in is by far not the only one to combat Gold warrior who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you can give the social media faith .
in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics , which feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ renowned pages .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Bogen@@ fels Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger written on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people sit on the Internet as a certain ar@@ cher of the dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US team in Bogen@@ fels Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a s@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after images , on whom he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cover@@ tly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to that he has already been listening to his childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself also see no great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I don &apos;t leave it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly appear in the centre : the remarkable simil@@ arity between the British and Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes should be passed through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one a@@ isle more : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the inc@@ eption acting .
another approach was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice , who has similarly sized eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun@@ b@@ ted skin and bl@@ on@@ ate hair as the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan was attacked Adrian of fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others also enjoyed the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user , there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual appearance and eyes .

Mac@@ Donald , who was brought to the comment@@ ators team of C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went down like Mi@@ ef , died like a pig .
thanks for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , allowing the Canadian allowed to close the gap to China .
spectators watching all over Canada quickly acted online , after they were shocked by sound and language .
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer in China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot has not capit@@ ated that they were still on stream . &quot;

another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you only present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ assi@@ sts look like . #
a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show , was live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast on a swimming pool . &quot;
it was a un@@ fortunate comp@@ ul@@ ating , I &apos;m sorry that it &apos;s happening . &quot;
at the end over 90 times , C@@ BC spent more than 90 times on people who have answered B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message out .
we regret it correct that these statements were made , and that it was possible that it has been broad@@ cast@@ ed .
we watched us yesterday evening fast with our spectators on the show and our followers in the social media .
in order to clari@@ fy one , By@@ ron comments are based on the performance of swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless they were un@@ reasonable and un@@ fortunate . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald was preaching in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment of time to excuse me for the comment that I made for the women &apos;s b@@ aff@@ le in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am looking forward to the performance of swi@@ mmer and not referred to as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no contemp@@ t , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;

the buyer did not know where to see them when a woman with@@ drew their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mar@@ row to taste shelter .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she whis@@ pered , as she looked out in her , and put her back into the shelf .
she continued and tried four pairs of sub@@ h@@ osen in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ wear the under@@ wear , she went and left the business without buying something . &quot;
she said , &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of under@@ pins from the base , with@@ drew her own Str@@ um@@ h@@ osen and tro@@ users and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even tried to find a bit dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone was star@@ ing when she did not like the under@@ pants that you didn &apos;t like it , because she put it back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more sub@@ h@@ osen before she finally decided that her didn &apos;t well liked it and went out .

Ms. Davi@@ dson , added : &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw clothing pieces from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of sub@@ h@@ osen and find out that another wife had an@@ ked and pulled it again and did not have washed them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms
the world is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ i Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to circum@@ navigate the pre@@ dat@@ or of the pre@@ dat@@ or .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind you will show this video as you turn around for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you turn from behind , then you should turn your att@@ acker , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the gun line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you strike your face with your free ell@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee into the womb , and turn it down , while the att@@ ack@@ ers shot down sor@@ rows , the weapon of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backward while putting the weapon on him .
at the sho@@ res coming from the front , the technology is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ acker can &apos;t shoot .
when throwing at the same time the weight on the weapon and beat the attack on the breast , then turn the weapon out of his grip , before they move backward and make the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ macy .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est thing to ski@@ p your money - as long as you are not a Kra@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for one travel guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eler under@@ lined his immune system and dig@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - selling some of the dirty and most disgu@@ sting places of Europe .
the present@@ er and trav@@ eller Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ olk shi@@ fted his way to a euro banknotes , a rail@@ ing at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a r@@ ins@@ ing pot of fine toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before using every object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show and show us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight .
the idea , to le@@ ase the r@@ ins@@ ing pot of a draw@@ bar that has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as over his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public money at railway stations , up to sc@@ rub@@ bing of toilets , the task assigned to its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample
in the film he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot;
in the film he was justified in his call .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometric score of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer count is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse , after their lumin@@ ometric count amounted to 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel agent &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom .
in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I &apos;ve got to go in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I will not touch here , because it is inside a disgu@@ sting room .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company pays homage to Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and New Categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says , &quot; We wanted to really offer something new for the consumer .
something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we caught mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ings , which thus ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide the consumers more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film &apos;s direction , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me say so - I have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have asked him to le@@ ak such as the disgu@@ sting russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to attach them and others , with which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents were associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally use products that included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .

after they were for@@ ci@@ zed out of their estate , shocked employees of residential property was the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls mar@@ qu@@ ished , wooden floors were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the Hous@@ ing department at Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that she fears the apartment is no more to repair .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I &apos;m convinced that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider , since this property is probably considered not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is too .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the tabernacle , and the police said that the terror , which had added the family , sm@@ all@@ holders of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive scre@@ ams , Stre@@ ets and Flu@@ chen had included .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was standing on the le@@ ase , received an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate , in which in the past drugs were tra@@ ded , the wooden floors are torn
neighbors told that they had batt@@ led them on the street and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the estate after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunte@@ ered .
del@@ og@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , saying that their life was made to hell .
one said , &quot; They were not ashamed . &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - that &apos;s not the way !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing , said that it ab@@ hor@@ red the family with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the un@@ secured site of the house , garbage and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that it ab@@ hor@@ red the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a delay is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall Hous@@ ing .
that was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds for their neighbours had to look terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community that went cour@@ ageous to us and have done us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development is don@@ ate to some neighbors and gives the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 .
a dirty one , located in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ eting on the floor
workers in the Hous@@ eh@@ ouse will now have to clean up the house , surrounded by the house
in 2014 , the police launched a Raz@@ zia in the house and found about 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es , and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 .
skel@@ eton received a fine @-@ penalty after having found guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in trading vision .
they claimed that the money was a grave of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 for a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner now lives in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police tells us that it is ten@@ ant to del@@ ate ten@@ ants that don &apos;t hold on the house@@ keeper
Angela C@@ row divided by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall with that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not comply with the house@@ keeper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are those who think that they may behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations and those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior who continue to work together with partners to protect our churches .
tourists in Portugal disp@@ at@@ ched after a ti@@ eff@@ er military jet beach flies
Sonnen@@ an@@ bet@@ er in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their life
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of the air traffic forces put an incredible storm flight
the air force admitted that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted on that there was no security risk .
this was the moment , in the frigh@@ tened tourists begin to start in panic after a ti@@ reless jet passed over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost in tan@@ gible proximity to sun@@ bathing places on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the northern Portugal .
the holi@@ day@@ makers arrived , as they were understand@@ ably concerned about the noise of the de@@ coupling movements , without seeing what the clouds came to her .
the incident happened last night in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice a very deep and there was a moment when it looked like that , it would crash . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I just was on surfing and it felt like that the plane would come down on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came from the darkness and was incredibly low .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion airplane was located on a training flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and so deeply to fly , that this was the only opportunity to identify them .
the spokes@@ man said that the Jet due to the bad visibility is somewhat deeper than usual in the vicinity , however , the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was endangered .
surface fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese fortress , where four people were killed on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions - strong fog and fire - so deep flies had to fly as low as its sight .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with wor@@ ries against Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans are competing in the Du@@ el to the Spanish Super@@ cup down@@ ward against the FC Sev@@ ille , the return of only three days later in the Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ bet must be in power with the under@@ stated cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe League champion under others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ And@@ re is also missing .
the German suffered a bending stress in the training , with which the inquiry for Bar@@ ca is at least pre @-@ clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ airs w@@ ett@@ ei@@ vers in Barcelona for two years now have the status as a number one .
coach Luis Enrique ha@@ sten@@ ed on a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but rather T@@ er St@@ airs in most of the rest of the candidates .
before the first mandatory bac@@ kl@@ ash of the new game , there is a doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool , with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really know how to convince .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat of an extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ a@@ ña . &quot;
with the eleven successes of this world , Barcelona is the record winner of this candidate .
Ma Long in a very own league on table tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defe@@ ats his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; title holder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ cho@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title one another .
this was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the singles @-@ title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ ings was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ legi@@ onn@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between sets and at time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches .
they pulled back on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ ests at fair competition in the fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final , I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang subsequently said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game pos@@ ing gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally .
Ma was only really fighting for his 28 @-@ year opponents in the first set .
after that , he put the pace in the plate and Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points .
through the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , not the expected comp@@ iling match .
but nevertheless , there were enough stunning ballo@@ ons to see .
Mi@@ cho@@ ani won the game by bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion , Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov had dra@@ gged an appeal after the German European champion , it had to be in medical treatment .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have become very similar to the Olympic @-@ old Olympia @-@ V@@ ated by the way .
Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leaders of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive troubles , also in traditional conservative states their majority .
Presi@@ dential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weak@@ nesses of his election campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Utah .
a rare moment at which the usually large @-@ scale and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported such something as concerns told how correspon@@ dent reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he threw 16 ri@@ vals inside the race from the race , now doubt the doubt of his success in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
guilt are false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media release .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes are viewing Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is custom@@ ary for Republican candidates in the state .
as endangered is Arizona and Georgia .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ t : &quot; as I did so far . &quot;
and if : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t make anything different to tell &quot; the truth . &quot;
in the end , if the political correc@@ t@@ ness is not rich , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump should have threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present a better fra@@ ction .
instead of doing , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are stronger than the arms .
Olympia : three @-@ edge sc@@ am at D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C plans to set up an disciplinary committee of discipl@@ ines .
Kenya &apos;s male cont@@ ested for the second d@@ oping affair with the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after an fraud attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with immediately to establish a committee of discipl@@ ines in order to investigate the fall .
a ken@@ ian function was informed that the former Sprinter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had submitted a urine test under the name of the 800 metre @-@ meter F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this was reported from the D@@ oping control station by the D@@ oping control station .
the IA@@ AF world federation has performed the IO@@ C for information about the case of ri@@ gor@@ ous investigation , an IA@@ AF present@@ er divided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will receive an evaluation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and wrote as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ ias boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stand on the list for the training controls in the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become in Beijing World Cup in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics leader Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is alleged to have informed the pay@@ outs of his country on upcoming D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested in his return at the Nairobi airport .
since a longer period of time , Kenya has already been taking a special observation on the IO@@ C after numerous d@@ oping orders .
during the announcement of the IO@@ C set up more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio games , it was unusual that athletes from Kenya and Russia should be taken into the visor .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil to create a anti @-@ D@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was passed only a few weeks before the Olympia start .
subsequently , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose d@@ oping com@@ b@@ ating with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the World Championships 2015 in Beijing most medals .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , ARD will always be charged , that in Kenya d@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant ment@@ ality of athle@@ tic ev@@ asion .
IO@@ C Member , Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had questioned them in Russian Athle@@ tics .
thereby , it could be proven that this sport @-@ area and systematically ged@@ opt was verified .
Russia &apos;s athletes have been exp@@ elled from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ elan leader Gust@@ avo Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their temp@@ o and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she remembers her loving kindness with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always been fascinated me .
first , because it is unusual musi@@ cally !
and then Mary &apos;s personality is still there .
she tells it in her song : &quot; I produced Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I for Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is smart , of course nai@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character I like Roman I , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bag@@ amel is a wonderful artist for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honour for us to work with her .
it is a mon@@ ey@@ ed young man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; bag@@ amel is like an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that &apos;s very important to all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . McKin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ atism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York City didn &apos;t want to .
they are the same themes , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died according to her family , shortly after she had planned to leave the war and to return to England .
&quot; we can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a di@@ lution and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war zone - people ever get to meet this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school children from the east of London stepped into a plane to Turkey , and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas family has been informed that they had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .

Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass acc@@ urs@@ ed
&quot; who does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the drop of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish town@@ spe@@ ople anticip@@ ate ten thousands of pat@@ rons in short term , from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; says the officer of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
because of the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , in Germany , the Kurdish congregation of Germany expects a mass acc@@ urs@@ ed to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when Erdo@@ gan &apos;s regime will continue fighting the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the Chief Executive Officer Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had handed down Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ gers over pen@@ alties , some 500,000 Kurds in Turkey are on the escape .
after the failed put@@ sch , sec@@ ular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
many will begin to re @-@ start in Europe when they will be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who takes refuge in his own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Soviet leader accused the targeted settlement of sy@@ ris@@ er Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the extermination back to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader called on that the German government has positioned themselves &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics .
in the last months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement is also fear@@ ing the escape of many Turks .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
fire mark@@ ers as well as Gü@@ len followers destroys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics in professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , also the Kem@@ alists and Sec@@ ular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal against the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already ordered the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany because of the coup .
as of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people , and thus just under 29 percent of all have been granted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , people cannot find themselves worried about war , poverty or ag@@ el@@ essness .
asylum justified according to the Basic Law are politically , i.e. from the state of law , individual followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
rare Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the national day .
they have understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not take place once again at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for so far , as far as it does not go : summer holidays , heat and country @-@ fighting arena - this bit@@ es itself .
the locals who are to be convinced of the poll@@ ing men are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers traveling in the country are on the island of Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not allowed to choose the country .
to do this , practical problems : the hel@@ pers who infl@@ ames posters , ballo@@ ons and fl@@ yers are distributed at the end of voices , only m@@ üh@@ ev@@ acu@@ ate .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and last week &apos;s day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to fight for just under the people .
the hot phase , if one can say that , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now evident in p@@ olls behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strong new@@ comer will cut AF@@ D and remains the same at the end of the ali@@ thic suit@@ ability .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees of his major posters .
he travels across the country , spread roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , as it is already his legendary wor@@ shi@@ fter predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors have got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel has the blame for the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is believed to cost him now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its peak candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you are doing wrong time at the right place election campaign .
she has invited twice a ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany , listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U does not abst@@ ain from the usual election events on market places and before shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
this , co@@ king says , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot;
the union also noted that you take the basis of the country , that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people .
you are just like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the mountains of the country hardly exist .
however , the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ Elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert to his Mit@@ stre@@ iter is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because there is much on the stake , Sell@@ ering has called up his SPD into a particularly dedicated campaign .
in p@@ olls the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD gained clear from 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , smallest party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to make the jump into the country &apos;s day .

B@@ 27 Ref@@ urb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the rapi@@ dity , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
for the manager of the construction work , begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and at least 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are all praise praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made all quite z@@ est , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no reference .
at the beginning of October , the construction site could be moved to the south , until the end of October will be completed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commen@@ ces are also responsible for the construction of the works , for example , if it comes to the establishment of housing passes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site opened on Monday to the south , and also the lock of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and so also the connection to the Rot@@ ak , the traffic situation has relaxed in the place .
the citizens now can drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
the failure to go through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief manager Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping ways were looking for , rather than the signs .
what led to that certain trucks in residential areas de@@ fran@@ ce .
since then , the speed limit has not been kept , the assembly called the Mess@@ engers from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant convic@@ tions , &quot; says King , who himself faced a spot on the location itself .
there are already two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was at 77 km / hour in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ or is now open the road again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
however , that the B 27 @-@ re@@ refurb@@ ishment has resulted in sales of revenue , everyone who is asking you will look through .
however , some more and some are less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final customers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , the refurb@@ ishment has barely any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not light decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also dream of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly sha@@ ken are the local street along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only it , but all the owners have hit it . &quot;
the clients were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue declined by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the street an@@ an@@ ation has thrown his operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
he had to release the half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , the policy would react differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on request of a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there might be a financial compensation , the guest house benef@@ ited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also have to take the dis@@ advantages , spread through the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so somewhat more generous .
in all clari@@ ons , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family @-@ run business lived here already in 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history .
for other regul@@ ars , other regul@@ ars can now be found less frequently due to the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t travel , it is quite different .
from the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about the end of the restoration work .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the biggest crisis which has experienced its host in their long @-@ standing history .
construction work is already brutal . six months of work is already brutal .
the terrorist attack in laws is constantly screw@@ ed in the name of the terrorist act .
after the most recent proposals , the Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
all his proposals are politically acceptable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs at the launch of his new safety equipment .
they don &apos;t demand anyone .
others , further points would initially discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this way .
but as the Minister of the Interior , he was situated on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach passed a little time , before he presents his conclusions for safety in the republic .
but these are the more extensive .
a lot is known , announced , announced that a new security authority is to take care of the bu@@ ck of encrypted communication , is not new .
also , not the fact that Germany must implement several EU specifications on passenger data and arms law .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies are also not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second step forward for proposals that have not been to the SPD so far : he wants to kno@@ ck out sympath@@ ies for counter @-@ groups and jihadists with double citizenship to German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The CD@@ U @-@ Man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , it will still be reasonable and ask nothing , which at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist have not chances of chances in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist .
a few new ideas presented to de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
this is partly in itself : it is planning fast process for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people from deportation .
refugees , which are targeted specifically to the country , should propose to check their smartphones and ex@@ termin@@ ate social media accounts for security check .
when Dul@@ ce for past asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to present some even worse than ever - such as those who go off@@ ences or throw away their papers in order to emb@@ ell@@ ish her identity .
some of them is political and legally sanc@@ tification .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves issues openly .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of sc@@ ul@@ ating for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to imagine that the assass@@ in of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the high number of refugees .
and things that the people are deeply busy , they would not be cl@@ er@@ red even in election campaign times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach .
the pollution is great .
and yes , there are election campaign .
Union and SPD increasingly bring to internal security , therefore , increasingly in position .
in the past days there was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ den@@ ger dispute over the configuration of the Federal Police , then on a safety policy collection of some foreign minister of affairs , in which the Ress@@ orts chiefs demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition , and demand a return of double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère m@@ üh@@ t also here to reconc@@ ile sounds .
from a return from the double pass , he stop nothing .
we have taken the discussion in Germany .
they re @-@ up , don &apos;t be sensible .
and on a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he rejected the constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is un@@ constitutional on all corners and if it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; it is necessary to show the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist .
there is a lot in it , which could cause dispute .
but also the SPD is trying to pro@@ pon@@ ate himself on the subject of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only a careful conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting worse through .
despite diesel engines , the suppliers will rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it works .
there is a term in response to the response .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest motorway can continue to prove a positive increase in the previous year .
but in July , the core brand VW was we@@ aker mainly in Western Europe and covering the total sales that the D@@ ax noted in the D@@ ax .
the VW brand sold the brand VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
the deliveries increased by almost one sixth in the home market of Germany .
market leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the fain@@ ter numbers from July especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions , &quot; I have given a purchase price .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British endor@@ s@@ ement of the EU was bur@@ dened by the EU , a spokes@@ man explained .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas is escal@@ ating first , there is also another Min@@ us to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony will continue throughout the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extradition minus 0,9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles are available .
consolidated Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue further sales from January to July .
in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone , VW , some 2.5 million cars are calling for re@@ armament to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of vehicles , it does not give fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance .
the bus station sp@@ ends the customer after the conversion a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; warranty , &quot; as it was in business travel on Friday .
that is the reason legal em@@ ulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen is now granted a guarantee for full diesel models now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Transport was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; VW carries the regulations of my investigation Commission and the KBA complete . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance , after the conversion no deterior@@ ations take place , and all typical approved vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen will see the possibility that customers will come to an example half a year after the change@@ over with a engine damage to a workshop - and that could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , in customer interests , it should be important to avoid that any damage to any damage caused by the ab@@ hor@@ ous sc@@ andal pl@@ ain@@ able with regard to any warranty , as it was named .
for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands special savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on gre@@ ed or daily c@@ ash@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could not be afraid to pay for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they must exchange money at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent in the European Central Bank ( ECB ) .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 Euros on gre@@ ro@@ - or daily cash payments .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been holding 40 million euros for a time , which could be lifted from one day to the others , and could not be able to evaluate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me in the central bank account and account for 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down to any million 4000 Euros . &quot;
the costs are now on the subject principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash flow in the box of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like even the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank note . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed any other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; the extreme monetary policy price of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
they alone carry alone , be &quot; non @-@ economic permanently possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account leadership , credit cards or credit transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burger made headlines in 2014 with their skat@@ bank branch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Bank , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect that private clients have to be paid for in@@ sol@@ es , in addition to the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks much too strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is a cliff located by the wealth of something luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she bag free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ at , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actor , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of the German People &apos;s Banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich declared : &quot; the threshold , into the negatives compared with the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors .
customers in Germany are not allowed to fall in the width .
destination disks : who is buying records ?
lon@@ ely men love middle ages .
before you come to a comment , to over@@ se@@ duce it under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ Alle@@ d@@ war@@ n ages with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ development of records of records are not limited to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which would welcome the curiosity of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all pre @-@ view at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional significance : older sk@@ et@@ ries retain their feelings rather to themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I carry a modest gray suit , a modest gray suit , before I stand to stick , my hands hold and something identi@@ fying what I say : &quot; so let &apos;s take a close look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of So@@ h@@ os joins its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers had been based - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate your age and mind by observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 I read by Sister Ray ( Data : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data : eight men middle @-@ age , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy , when he appeared and again buy objects when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things which I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s true to those who buy disks , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my master .
We@@ z , 25 who works with Sister Ray , also believe that many customers that he hits to the You@@ go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ ances , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and let themselves see their old records again .
of the discussions that I have led , people usually have emp@@ tied their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to the tra@@ pping of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Phon@@ ica to realize that record transactions are a soo@@ thing community of equ@@ est@@ ants .
according to We@@ z , some of the older customers attended the cont@@ act@@ less payments system .
some record enthusiasts will feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw the stability of familiar sil@@ en@@ tical items , from objects , happy events of youth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it can sometimes be the col@@ t of a void or the property of material poss@@ essions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is with me as a collector , and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to be mentally eng@@ aging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a staff of a platform stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record for the last month they haven &apos;t heard .
the survey also found that 41 % had a record players who never use them while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have a record player .
at this point of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while passing through a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova coma .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three men middle @-@ aged age ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone first came up here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead records , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record players . &quot;
these are younger people , not elderly , which are not very slowly .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I am puri@@ fied .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and women &apos;s middle ages .
even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the fore@@ seen stores - Wild Be@@ asts , the latest syn@@ thesi@@ ology and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ates from the speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ atility among customers .
no one of them looks like lon@@ ely lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ged psych@@ otic trau@@ mas are badly det@@ ectable if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around for a few minutes in the business and viewed the variety of plates available for sale .
she is more a sh@@ ov@@ en@@ bum@@ ble@@ bee as a big purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so the collecting records are not real option , &quot; she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or any way , but the beauty of records is ... it drives with a really loved epidemic .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , of which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the registration to mu@@ star the jeans hot@@ pants , I woke up a group of young te@@ ens , which take a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buying a Cros@@ ley record players .
on the left there is a stair@@ case , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
no one sees her in - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to express it .
it is pure &quot; sheet art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most important for luxury objects such as records .
even if my research shows that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they leave at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record li@@ king , which exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while leaving the ga@@ ze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er , who rises above the shoulders of age @-@ aged men &apos;s middle ages .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live down .
in case of a court hearing this week the authorities argued that the state should carry out 72 temporary shops selling shops , selling hair@@ y services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would be a parallel economy , which would be paid out of taxes and pay a fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals distributed by the government supported association and other groups , do not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp .
in addition , they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional stores , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais Pre@@ fecture will be absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes , and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live &quot; in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot;
he said that the area of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s Café of the camp , public @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as a advice about asylum items for the hundreds of protection @-@ needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest is eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated to have risen to more than 9.000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me hon@@ estly , it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyze , analyse which reasons for de@@ bac@@ le had led .

group rises to start @-@ up for live video games
to watch other people playing video games , a huge thing - of which I want to benefit from Microsoft .
the technology group buys the start @-@ up Be@@ am that speci@@ alizes in this hobby .
as much money is flowing for the acquisition , Microsoft has not distributed Microsoft on Thursday .
Be@@ am went to start with his offer until January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others at play , but also interv@@ ene .
for example , they can place your players &apos; missions and place enemies as well as equipment .
the Spiel@@ eri@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard will start a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of E @-@ Sports .
Facebook will help to contribute to the global media event .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the employees of the start @-@ ups , which has its headquarters in Seattle , currently in Seattle in Seattle , moved to the Red@@ mond headquartered in Seattle , such as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and head of Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i .
for customers , this is intended to change anything through the takeover .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the Xbox console .
the Live Stre@@ am@@ ings market of video games is currently growing rapidly .
well @-@ known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
in 2014 , T@@ witch was purchased from Amazon online for almost one billion dollars .
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google @-@ Mother Alp@@ habet .
here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser needs to adjust to the next generation of speed monitor : in various states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening equipment will be tested particularly effectively .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic @-@ effective en@@ forcement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or re@@ acting bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure a stationary aper@@ ture to ensure compliance with speed limit .
a durable mobile installation can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be encrypted via a modem .
in addition , laser measuring technology can also be recorded all vehicles over several tracks .
variable speed limit as well as drive train depending on time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be super@@ charged .
in the highly driven state , one can move the trailer to the manufacturer with a trailer hook .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ assy , it is lowered with the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ cks are dis@@ car@@ ded , and by the way , the safe outside gro@@ ms disappear .
furthermore , a built alarm system is intended to protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states has been tested and meanwhile also used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also foreign authorities fl@@ ashes with the new technique : more recently , France has received 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ year Rug@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain during the 7 @-@ year @-@ old Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday night at a sl@@ ed stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
in Fiji he divided a master@@ class in the handling , side step@@ ping , rep@@ ut@@ ching , liner run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - her first Olympic Medal of any color .
the defeat was failed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of silver medal - the fourth in that day - and they couldn &apos;t be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals of the same day could fall back to her in the finals .
but in this form , a 15 @-@ man team would have been in the form of this form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is director Ben Ryan , the former head of England from Wimbledon .
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan each game in Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
they lost only one one here .
this sl@@ ack will hurt , but the progress is amazing .
in Fiji , wonder@@ full and left the attacks G@@ BS from fun .
it felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as if you run in driving buses . the World Series winner went to top 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was in the corner .
with another four minutes season , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has barely hit the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve , but it has only stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a touch down , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the back p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ cleared out another weak tac@@ t@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is so , when Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB still has to be joined .
it is like that .
GB introduced fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and concluded the fi@@ ji@@ anian gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan N@@ orton started a trial for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went back for a long time in favour of the South @-@ Consul@@ ate , whose fans che@@ eks , f@@ ests and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the gambling approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the i @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle and the whi@@ stle , the Fi@@ j@@ is revol@@ ted and turn cr@@ ushing down in the lawn .
early on the day , Fiji had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Britain urged South Africa to hit the race @-@ final match of the race - the Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half forward , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the items in the second half .
a brilliant late spot of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning Inspi@@ red by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more engine gold than in those games and that wants to be hot .
from the first rowing boat to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though it were only those who were sitting at the ru@@ d@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was there as she became the second Olympi@@ ad in the two , without tax , the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , however , its 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ lag@@ ged deployment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ets that gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of gay , which is not reflected the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es .
behind each gold in rowing is a bat@@ alli@@ on to content hel@@ pers that make up the difference and there was no more dangerous than the trainer , who would not survive this day at all , when cancer was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky what ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer who is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather narrow situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could start what was the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that &apos;s the right term for such circumstances .
I needed money , so I needed to go back soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
so it begins .
the rowing on itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ ability of victory we went their first thoughts to Williams , who spent a ner@@ ven@@ er@@ ous morning so he spent a little more than anything else and thereby trying to handle his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning who was as captain of the Royal Artill@@ ery regim@@ ent in action in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is repeated only , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and I also worked on .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you . he is the best trainer in the world .
I would have no better person for coaching or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark have started up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much to reserve too much in reserve .
we were very caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important to dis@@ rip itself away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something ra@@ bies .
we wanted to have no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take time for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ s group , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is retired .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria . &quot;
a small limited drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the original Bavarian Radio for some time ago in the original Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken dismissed the association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ ate group &quot; bay@@ ern far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all of this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the forced association , was 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
drinking water @-@ purpose group with headquarters in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water every year and provides 32 places and ham@@ let with approximately 5500 inhabitants .
member communities are the church of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remembered that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water keeper and was appointed the executive director of the association .
&quot; his tasks are very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the budget plan , calculation of fees and contributions by way to emergency risk , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land sales in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 1999 ) and the re@@ ten@@ tion of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) .
there have never been a stand@@ still and it was repeatedly recorded , because water means life , and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio , they praised Gö@@ llers , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for its water @-@ purpose and he has really lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be his own company .
a few weeks ago , he considered a true practition@@ er to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ s group for nit@@ rates in front of the Water Forum of the District of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
he received much recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised the Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ ver , who worked with him 28 years .
he is the best water keeper and he was a devoted scar@@ ce .
together , we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from the point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the association .
but the most difficult challenge and the most difficult use , however , was the pi@@ er at the Kirch@@ lou@@ der at a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn was also only maintained , because you filled the container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with battles .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who calls the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the Sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corriere della Sera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , they believed that they should die .
but now eigh@@ ty @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago is now well ahead and learn privately in New York where it is the best therapist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example , if I ask him something for two years , when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Netanyahu said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ k@@ os connection with the Bass@@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots in life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) was shot at his partner and wounded them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and reported to have shot his lifetime companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police pre@@ acher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the off@@ ender be on the run , after him will be publicly re@@ ign@@ ited .
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a glass .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon with themselves , so the police .
he who sees Sven S. is meant to call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship division . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 .
the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any information about the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing spre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police pre@@ acher in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to ey@@ e@@ witnesses , a special conference office ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .
steel - lighting for the German steel industry
the curved and energy @-@ eng@@ aging German steel industry remains un@@ affected by additional costs in million@@ aires .
financial loads , threatened by the industry from the green power generation , are from the table .
the liberation of renewable energies in the German steel industry will remain in the liberation of renewable energy production in the German steel industry , the German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally reach after two years of negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Commission , the European Commission planned to use the steel manufacturer , the gases coming from the high @-@ furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry marked an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the W@@ AZ , there is now a meeting certificate with the EU Commission for talks with competition statements Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , all an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will be replaced .
but also this will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission to conduct its own production .
so , the Status Quo &apos;s status will largely be written .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special significance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be calculated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable pressure .
in the past year , the situation further intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest producers in China over@@ throwing major steel on the global market .
European manufacturers cast Chinese steel trade pricing d@@ umping .
in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed .
for the one show , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ air@@ steel effect , the other economic outlook in China have been suspended .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the pricing is re@@ covering .
the German branch sen@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp stayed carefully on Thursday .
last@@ ly the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclu@@ de some works of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced approximately 3.4 million tonnes of crude steel as well as compared with the previous year &apos;s monetary union , acting on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the amount paid back in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production lies by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association anticip@@ ates increasing output thanks to an improved order back@@ log .
community , mind , health : singing sen@@ iors good
the singing has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she took the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , mer@@ ri@@ ly and overall , says she .
in addition to her health and her spirit she is doing something good .
for singing is like a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler says from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
by regular co@@ hes@@ ion , sen@@ iors social contacts can slip and maintain .
because often social and family structures occur at the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to talk and organise themselves on the other , and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction . &quot;
singing can be st@@ ress@@ ful in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
in doing so sen@@ iors are practicing deep and controlled breathing .
whoever asks his lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age , singing a optimum hobby .
in elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal association of sen@@ iors @-@ organizations .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through song lyrics and especially melodies , people are de@@ pressed to themselves on long @-@ lying events .
in addition , the head is demanding a special achievement , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focus on his own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cog@@ nitive challenge .
older people who live alone , exercise so , not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in chor@@ us , H@@ ac@@ kler writes .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em is growing through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I am long for something I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ c@@ ingly people who hears , when a tone is coming next to it ?
in the search for the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors are different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone singing the circle in a veter@@ an ench@@ ant@@ or , you can just connect .
many cities also offer views over cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior tunes can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet , can ask family , friends or neighbours with the help of Internet access .
if you want to sing , you should have to connect to a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler advis@@ es .
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ bler as a tom@@ cat on scre@@ am of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover , which effect the rowing of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise , the male also didn &apos;t get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in the difference to the females always .
female cats may recognize the cat@@ ch@@ ment of cat bab@@ ys near the ch@@ ew of the young@@ sters .
they react by ten percent faster at the lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens that have found themselves in great distress , such as scientists from the University Medical School and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
cats also respond to the rowing of K@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the acou@@ sti@@ cal differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly inherited young ones for the males either un@@ per@@ cep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams distingu@@ ishes with the ur@@ gency of their help requirements .
nine adult males and eight females have been observed from the livestock farming of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rod of little ones , which were taken up for three minutes from the throwing box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
in other words , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ aming of stronger caught k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally lifted .
the researchers have their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females even those who did not have their own offspring responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned swi@@ vel to the loud@@ speaker , when this calls of the very rainy k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability is possibly an@@ born or developed with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have ever responded , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist .
in the past , scientists have already resear@@ ched the reactions of women and men on baby @-@ noise .
there are also some studies that women re@@ acted sensitive on infants , regardless of whether they were mothers , or not , reported the biolog@@ ist Marina She@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ ses is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the younger football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ mp@@ r .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey a major football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official train : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
even during the suspension of an emergency medical examination in July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ alities should not be imp@@ aired .
this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
the football is also not done before football .
an arrest warrant issued against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ ses issued an arrest warrant .
in the meantime , he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America in America .
Sü@@ kis@@ ses must be responsible for the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
while the latter is valid for 90 days , the state of emergency was still valid until October , in fact , this is the life of most Turks , but as good as any effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the night &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places of the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - split in followers and enemies of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally among the friends of the president .
what the Turks occupied the Turks , but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict re@@ jection of military put@@ ties .
there are even the fans agre@@ es - no matter whether their heart beat Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at Po@@ kal@@ sieger &quot; Gala &quot; we will be arriving very much again to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Köl@@ ner in the expired season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitive competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ b@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; looked at him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an outstanding way and secured the trop@@ hy in his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record master was a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; went up early in the Europe League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g there was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the basis for the 14th title with 26 season tra@@ ms as the South @-@ Li@@ g cake .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the time that the AC Florence was standing under contract and did not just rent Bes@@ ik@@ tas Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , due to the political situation in the country after his EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the storms must be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of its EUR 7.5 million an estimated annual season , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary at Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

others , the athle@@ tics of athle@@ tics , can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio .
the topic D@@ oping defines the headlines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented their starting right shortly before the play , was handed out with her start ( 100 meters of breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly out and hat@@ ched .

but there are still numerous other athletes who , despite the D@@ oping past , go to the Rio Olympics in the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Justin Bau@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was blocked two times for d@@ oping in 2001 ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion runs even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the biggest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after you have been verified taking the pain of pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don .

a means to penis enlargement is responsible , bet@@ ting Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete became intoler@@ able .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Championship title in 2005 , nine years later , after having found testosterone d@@ oping .
meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old has had to release Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid d@@ oping d@@ oping and the EM @-@ title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
he also recovered bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also returned to the CA@@ S International Sport Court .

bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood in contact with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday night .
they have suffered chi@@ pped and was treated in the hospital , but have already left it back .
her home trip was planned for early September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of State is in in@@ surg@@ ent contact with the local authorities , so sn@@ ap .
in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a Nightlife two bombs .
according to police , we were killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian woman , three German , three Dut@@ chman and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , once again , two sp@@ outs went up , and a further person was killed , according to the authorities .
Ph@@ uk@@ et was also reported in the morning a bomb explosion .
in the det@@ onation of the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police specification .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country then another bomb explo@@ ded .
according to the authorities in a flower bed before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police have gone into the air according to the authorities .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on to the Southeast Coast .
one went out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was named .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Is@@ eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday night before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express itself to possible motives , but it is likely to do the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the attacks are not in connection with Islamic insur@@ gency , or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one expects that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
the authorities have kept secret notes on the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and the locations .
yet it is un@@ clear what group behind the attacks .
the police reported their officers in the whole country to strengthen security around the main government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment district .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not judge for tourists .
in Hua H@@ in lies a palace , which was used over the years of Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ er@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after reason , bomb explo@@ sions recommends the Austrian Ministry of State on his homepage , to make instructions of Thai security agencies necessarily .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) used for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no necessary trips in these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
a few days after a controversial referendum on Thursday and Friday , a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta .
this cle@@ ars to the military big influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ff chaos , while the country goes towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps himself up to stability and order .
however , it did not succeed in the military , which has been in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country to get rid of Muslim rebels .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago , in Bangkok with a very popular Hindu shr@@ ine , 20 people were killed - most of them were foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t assault of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is the visa of the Federal Office for constitutional affairs .
after several nation@@ alities , the Constitutional Council also placed the Group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement against the freedom of democratic principles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Constitutional Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , the immigrants were diff@@ used by Islamic Faith or from the Middle East in the extrem@@ ist way .
therefore , we watch the movement as well .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group of group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and &quot; loss of their own identity . &quot;
constitutional law in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - see the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said , his authority is closely matched with the shareholders &apos; decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally speaking extre@@ mi@@ sts to address them with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
that is not a num@@ eric advertis@@ ements for your own thing .
propaganda is meant to appeal the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible to a special way .
this is dangerous .
recently , it had been reports from multiple federal states reports about contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to AF@@ D @-@ politicians .
Ma@@ ate said he did not have any insights .
for the Constitutional Protection , possible contacts this species are only relevant from a certain point .
in this case , the party - in this case the AF@@ D - through certain persons , the extrem@@ ist @-@ table , will change their destination and is so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive is , whether such persons have an impact on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase of law@@ makers and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have found in recent years that there can be justi@@ fying structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it may well be that other rectangular groups or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing motives are planning .
but it is clearly identi@@ fiable or europ@@ e@@ wide control of rectangular r@@ or@@ ism .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ate talked concerned about that many en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments went to the account of people who did not occur in the right @-@ right scene in the sight of the scene .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences , who were not politically in@@ different at all that were perhaps politically in@@ different or for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left but have radic@@ alised themselves through the extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world records from the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly over@@ seen s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slow that it was no longer visible in the TV images .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended its pre @-@ run and reserved the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old is participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was awarded a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ min@@ ed countries more familiar .
because in Eth@@ op@@ ia , most athletes are running , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else .
preparation is everything : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname made the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not have fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he took his time with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ isti@@ l , there played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable , the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ator from equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete in an advance of more than 100 metres fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically was fired by Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned first eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the imp@@ ending choice situation not so narrow
the republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks to an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already signed an alternative video .
he then moves to the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it would be no matter : &quot; ultimately it will be either open , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a phone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
in the end , if the political correc@@ t@@ ness is not rich , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said .
thus he described US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in its party , last ever more resistance has always been form@@ ulated .

Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the GfK top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring , however , are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad GfK business figures , each occasion is un@@ steady at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this would be the case with BMW , that &apos;s what we would like to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

accidents - Bus slip in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ listening in Gra@@ ben : eight wounded
an accident involving 43 senior citizens of the passengers were killed on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ listening ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , the police divided .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to bend their data according to a opposite le@@ aster , which was partly on the return track .
the bus came to the right off the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a speaker of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people cannot leave the bus independent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured trav@@ eler were taken back from a regular bus service to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ ater .
there you should wait for a spare bus of the travel business .
the investig@@ ators requested the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to sign up in the police .
the fees per cubic meter of waste will amount to 2.@@ 10 euros from 1 October 2016 to 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
if appropriate improvement measures will be needed at the Az@@ endorf plant , if appropriate for improvement measures will be necessary .
after a complete calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf is then located at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that , in the hom@@ olog@@ ation of the budget , was determined by the Coun@@ try@@ side of Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for these se@@ wage systems .
the market Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated due to legal foundations , to cover the facilities free of charge .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg are deeper into the pur@@ se .
the demand increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed a re@@ mod@@ ulation of the charges for the waste disposal of the market .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , excess and under@@ cover from the previous calendar period will be compens@@ ated .
the gra@@ dient @-@ set increases showed that in all three se@@ wer@@ age plants to operate relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage fall , that flies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
so , due to the low distribution system , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would affect several thousand euros .
moreover , the se@@ wage system is slightly decl@@ ining in all three systems .
furthermore , in the rec@@ u@@ itary time period of all three systems , they were not least fallen in a considerable extent due to their age , san@@ itation and repair charges .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for World Heritage , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that Az@@ endorf had to be replaced during the waste system Az@@ endorf due to a damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ fare , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and fired at the pond la@@ undering . after almost 20 years of operation , the first clari@@ fication plant had to be installed , the se@@ wage spon@@ ges and an additional ventilation may be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued medical and maintenance costs came into account according to the new calendar period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 was still clearly below the current level .
stone houses clearly made clear that low se@@ wage fall in the three systems suggest the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot;
this is , supple@@ mented Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wer@@ age plants in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ eded by stone houses on duration , especially since one cannot expand the supply of waste water @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al in order to expand this facilities because it is de@@ fied .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critic@@ ised as Asian cartoon
snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ asted , self @-@ reaching tools that generate more than 30 million Sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ appearances are to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past , in which they were accused of propag@@ ating the app Black@@ face to promote white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week of some Uz@@ be@@ ers hit a filter which gave them stripes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ ting . &quot;
they asked whether this repeated controversy has been referred to a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ atility .
the news and the indig@@ nation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat that it had been de@@ activated .
the company offered an ap@@ ologies : the filter was as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as carto@@ ons of Asi@@ ans .

in an e @-@ mail Grace spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely used on the photographs that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ingly and un@@ acceptable &quot; .
they added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter @-@ statement of a very conflic@@ ting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .

snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural settlement .
the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big crowd of young people - which are th@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older players - could not expect to expect sensitivity .
if one of snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters create a picture that is offensive for a user , so it is much more difficult to remember that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu decided to work as a product manager and engineer for the medium to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same .
in a recording for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that racial @-@ related controversy has a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part of white , just male leaders and finished her attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but are not in positions in which they are safe or feel good to say about . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that mostly left the Snap@@ chat .
the company does not publish numbers for the diversity of his workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently appointed a personnel responsibility that focuses on sub@@ merged population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will leave their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to tell you that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military service simpli@@ fy ISIS secret service information , presents the Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed re@@ frac@@ tory information to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states had allowed themselves to be in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , intelligence service committees and the military bud@@ get@@ ary , reported a great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , which reported their ass@@ essments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; secret information published by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com , recorded regularly a posi@@ ti@@ ver@@ able image of American efforts against terrorism when it would have allowed the actual conditions locally and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the formation of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct clu@@ es on Obama to change reports that government tips on Obama , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military retreat was already starting in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a opinion statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the number of Central Command closed down reports to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called Task Force to life after being admitted that analysts are worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by detailed findings .
additionally , additional investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of the market assessment of Isi@@ l and Iraq &apos;s security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave the highest ranking Democ@@ rat in the Committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a position . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mor@@ ality under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there were no clu@@ es on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General @-@ insp@@ ect of the Pentagon , which were analyzed by Cent@@ Com analysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press pre@@ acher of the Pentagon , gave evidence that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports during the investigation of the General Assembly .
but he also admitted that &quot; experts at times have under@@ passed opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the Intelligence and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion on this important issues of the national defence . &quot;
the investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question , to what President Obama can leave on Central Command for an honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis areas .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analyst , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about it , such as the former government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts only a small occupying force in Iraq and have little time to make thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in insur@@ rection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team increased by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government positions that contrary to government statements received by the Islamic State , there were no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group as this mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft refin@@ eries had taken into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s condemn Commander in Chief , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature due to its excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went into retirement in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States win four @-@ fourth match in a hockey player , a show@@ down with the UK .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American F@@ iel@@ e team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in mind .
they don &apos;t know that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are simultaneously in their group with the Brit@@ ons stay unbe@@ aten in its 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet each other on Saturday at the last match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will get their first and second place within their group .
the first placed is to take a little bit longer from the way , leading the other group .
whatever the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising host , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time a hockey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the United States , the youngest in the history of this team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because it couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham was an Engl@@ ish@@ man , train@@ ers of the National Team , and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ horse in London that we now have .
we have completely demol@@ ish the ru@@ d@@ der .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the tor@@ rent in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the middle range .
India had gone without victory in the game without victory at the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ ded the ball to the Americans to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , too late it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro vary consistently and un@@ avoid@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and stri@@ ving .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is served by the wrist@@ watch for gymn@@ asi@@ t to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in Coff@@ es@@ hop , without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ op@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could well be sent to Prime Time , which would be sent to Prime Time , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
further from the center , some in the shade there are the types of sports that are not generally recognised : air guns , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest , and may end it long .
but if I should make sure arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me turn the attention of the dis@@ crete charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines already have an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so pointed out that many people knew I didn &apos;t know that it was at all a Olympic port .
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the United States sent athletes on competition , it never won a medal in the trampoline and made a athl@@ ete that made it to the end of 2012 .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans who share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London .
the tramp@@ ol@@ ine jump has some extent of the side , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear to a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule , which sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a dead enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful tre@@ mor of his never to end coll@@ ision - but also the Gra@@ zie of the gym and diving , the two types of sports that combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means a lot means as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
rising vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before they landing at the feet .
you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution , difficulty level , and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ three athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio each other .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go back and back to the ground up and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also another cav@@ ity goal : the world or the Olympic champion .
the targeted stri@@ ving is no@@ bel , admi@@ red , even fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s enough to stir up a spect@@ ator .
but it is also what I feel when watching these games as a little fatigue .
of this , the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ine spr@@ ing@@ ers is above .
a forward motion is not the target .
he or she sto@@ oped down , seem@@ ingly hard@@ el@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly to the top .
there is also a contest , of course not without difficulty but during exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant raising of time and gravity .
it is like how the competition can only be with the Olympic Games .
the Quali@@ fication and final dogs of the women will take place on Friday in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 .
NBC gets out the final hand part of an afternoon distance to two days from 14.00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment that will probably be over@@ seen in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the level of consciousness can only be reached by the Ang@@ us and the objec@@ tions of male athletes - as the male US Turner first proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its after air rin@@ gement , new fan@@ base .
&quot; a Generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long Pro@@ ally of the United States
protests in Ethiopia in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters that demand political changes in Ethiopia are strug@@ gled on violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that some criminals were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia right to break ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid community with a fast growing economy .
but in the past few months protests against the government the country and far@@ med themselves in more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot dead and killed police officers .
in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demanded an incoming investigation .
&quot; it &apos;s always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , one research group .
Ethiopia is estimated to be the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians in order to fight terrorist attacks on the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dras@@ tically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was everything as a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was reduced , whereby dis@@ sidents were effectively put into silence .
many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , or pushed into the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have other options apart , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian Mountains .
the whole youth prot@@ esting .
a generation prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use up to sausages in relation to power of ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for these z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line took place in June hundreds of lives .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were forced more or less , the turbul@@ ence could benefit and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess are now able to explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through the social media , as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services .
even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , do so many people still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies to hide where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they were gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ n@@ ici@@ ties in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since branches prosp@@ ered , the Am@@ har@@ as , which originate from Eth@@ op@@ ia , mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in low@@ lands .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are involved in coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the largest protests were held in the fields of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in the military , in the trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was a former rebel leader until his death in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly embarrass@@ ed in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and Special Represent@@ ative to deal with opponents and to make it harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is missing on this fundamental idea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian , new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen of relatively in@@ comprehen@@ sible reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he enjoys the trust of the Tig@@ ray @-@ controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an u@@ pro@@ u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested by the Government , apparently by the government and subsequently stolen by the government .
during the following raid , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of the distur@@ ban@@ ces sank relatively quickly .
development experts commen@@ ce Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new com@@ mu@@ tion , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty .
but obviously , this does not have the intention to prevent internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ish city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred toward the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media .
analysts say that protests from the US and other Western allies bring into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American Government used Ethiopia as a base for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if they were recently informed that they closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it doesn &apos;t want his ally to unite into a volatile area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ titudes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his claim Obama to have ISIS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last controversy carried out by his campaign by sending his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication cast new questions on the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate with the American public .
it also brings his fellow com@@ rades who endeav@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain in the actual position that he could not mean .
after having made the impression at a voting event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump died in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted he did not intend to signi@@ fy the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in a early morning Twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply s@@ ark@@ as@@ tical .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a row of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to we@@ aken the statement , re@@ minded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , the republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism gra@@ bbed Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling down assets to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
he warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
in late July he moved strong criticism as he meant that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ t E@@ mails , but he later explained &quot; Of course &quot; I said the s@@ ark@@ as@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then back to ru@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages sent from his fans as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts who observe the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is smart enough to keep his testimony vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has received an even corro@@ sive tone , since its demand had declined further .
a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a lead with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head office in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he acc@@ uses his critics frequently to dis@@ agree his testimony or to understand his humor .
but while he focuses on the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps sn@@ ails his loyal contribut@@ ors to the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant his statements may also be .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps , was most prominent in the world to defend the candidates in a CNN @-@ interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says , legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said he was about the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps comments whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ es , completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq .
most mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government has served under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton used as a foreign minister , ISIS allowed themselves to spread themselves , the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control .
in front of the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and cast them up , riding on every one of his words and to be bi@@ ased with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand it and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats , with Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologi@@ zed as only one further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dency .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was an authentic café in William@@ sburg , in which you could only pay cash that no Wi @-@ Fi had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee .
of course it was pushed by the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in form of cup@@ cakes .
locals dress it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still cannot believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also curiosity .
a re@@ vit@@ alised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodriguez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when he offered a client to provide money for a new post office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodriguez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment again .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ns such as cap@@ ers and sour onions .
there is natural re@@ inde@@ er .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodriguez said that he had noticed a constant stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also being pushed by William@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg , and visits the ver@@ b regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to himself .
after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee fl@@ ashing , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that there was coffee and culture in the ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea next day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch @-@ watch and they prepare my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal will always get his usual order , but sometimes he changes his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ba@@ gel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rodriguez said he didn &apos;t blow an end that Sei@@ fen@@ shop has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is to prepare a special soap for ver@@ b with the cool coffee of the coffee coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; Rodriguez said .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish , and Rodriguez said that he planned to make them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice locally would like to fill the cold washed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café ended .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the location and felt a new coffee as a return home .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressed eating of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the president , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took home lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a delic@@ acy , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ thful for refined Del@@ ik@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; Jane Good@@ egel@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both of the food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the USA while brick in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ ap snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District that has already been in business since the IP@@ crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese squee@@ zed with olive pieces while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable dishes .
when the rep@@ orters worked out , this couple found a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; abundant food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , lo@@ af cheese and bread bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many peanuts to eat , that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male Fel@@ dar@@ es and served fresh baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the American who sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first world war . &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; records the paths which the country was surrounding the country to be no longer the battle of battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time in which food for the Americans was a central , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talented co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget makes the new budget : mysterious meals like bre@@ ads and cavi@@ ties were to stap@@ le to stap@@ le food , the k@@ asser@@ ol@@ es as a &quot; wonderful way , food remains &quot; &quot; , &quot; understood Zi@@ egel@@ man , as ch@@ efs of un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients could be conce@@ aled under a cre@@ st sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by low cost dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American kitchen for years , became a rare ser@@ rated luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar compounds have been tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ ent satisfaction was given to taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book that includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive on the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continued : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home business administration .
like never before or ever since , domestic appliances - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 @-@ 1943 - the Ess@@ ence of the Land of such as such as Louise Stanley .
by published recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , women encourage women to become &quot; home affairs &quot; and the challenge , p@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots into delicious meals to become righteous .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historical treat .
in particular , the reports about the government &apos;s answer to hunger @-@ star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer house in his kitchen , he sp@@ it like the million@@ th man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cooking like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in a almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a smo@@ king .
he was glorious real@@ time .
President Roosevelt would perhaps have committed the same mistakes , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to fit a mark with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most exciting treats . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on foods .
the couple gave to writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans &apos;s mother in law - for example , how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
Zi@@ egel@@ man re@@ minded : &quot; you actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind@@ beut@@ ler .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they pulled and cover a dessert , which they had prepared at home : the venue , the president Roosevelt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a more common trick , a humble name to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody di@@ pped something like a spoon into the t@@ ame , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t bad .
CO@@ E took a sur@@ ge three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ed he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A couple of chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old had died at a Fass@@ bomb attack on the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , who saved the lives of almost 60,000 people , according to the picture newspaper .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er put their own life on the game to pull people out of the bom@@ bed houses and make first aid in the war of war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian that shows him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a household from the ruins of a home went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians about the bright symbolic figure in the horror of war .
however , as heroes , he never saw himself , said : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die , save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four versions above the Alz@@ adia district , which was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath .
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous ves@@ tiges of the bomb , so that not children play it , &quot; quoted the picture of his last words before he died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deadly bomb of the Assad regime should hit terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
more rarely sight .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the S@@ anna research site .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie won &apos;t get up with 150 years of offspring .
leis@@ urely swimming in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour , it is currently 1.@@ 220 metres wide .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ meter long animal acceler@@ ates up to 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
this form of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a pat@@ tern@@ ess for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues have reported in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; at any time in Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ ün@@ emann says from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic Research in Rostock , this li@@ fes@@ pan means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the Evol@@ u@@ tions@@ bi@@ ologe ) already projected that Greenland &apos;s hair is st@@ ony .
only the evidence is missing .
Greenland &apos;s hair is hard to observe , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sho@@ res co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they appear mostly in the winter only in winter .
researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
her monthly pent@@ ag@@ ia is the same , when they were sam@@ pled six animals with a station in front of the val@@ bard .
this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up the ja@@ w of a young polar bears .
possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and looking for car@@ c@@ asses who are from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ unt , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was only 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long , whereas the largest 502 @-@ cen@@ tim@@ eters measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lens in shar@@ ks with the Carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of eye lens is already developed before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained in the proteins will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when atomic fact trials fell larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast , at 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters long @-@ smallest animal contained a low surplus of Carbon @-@ 14 out of the nuclear weapons , it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all the bigger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 Clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ eters long Greenland at a age of 335 years , during the record @-@ hair with 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters even 3@@ 92 years of age should be 3@@ 92 years old .
the Greenland @-@ females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now the researchers were able to arrange a age at the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters were probably determined on the threshold for sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined , Greenland &apos;s hair is evident at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live primarily in fer@@ rous waters is no coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , was put in his bacon on the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught before Alaska .
due to its low temperatures , the organism of living animals live on spar@@ k@@ flame .
so they mature later - and al@@ ight slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often particularly big .
the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal saves heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than at a gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it as far as many offspring as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution .
a very big animal , however , should invest its resources more in a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics around B@@ auen , the Municipal Council has focused on the most recent session .
with relief , the panel of Mayor Robert P@@ utz assumed that &quot; finally the marketing of re@@ juven@@ ated motor@@ homes can finally start . &quot;
after the plot , par@@ tis@@ ation and issu@@ ing issues were clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; street road &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Area Bin@@ der@@ straße - outbreak section 1 ) is no longer interested in interested parties .
the community is convinced that the building blocks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and ru@@ ly sen@@ iors alike appeal .
as it was said , building content will be noti@@ fied at once in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be consul@@ ted in its September session .
in order to continue with inquiries about further commercial establishments , associated with the creation of job creation , the Municipal Council decided to change the area planned for this year in the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of under@@ age , the commercial industrial area has expanded by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on Main , which is the best chance to compete in Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , has the best chances to attract jobs and firms .
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence centre and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money is still allowed to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions within the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport the approval in Britain has been enough .
this is just big US banks .
several banks have announced already , jobs to extingu@@ ish jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ ter &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision via the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance fund E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bench is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg stays a large fund sector , but as well as Dublin in the infrastructure is worse .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve .
further points the city with slightly available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the corporate consulting firm Mer@@ cer , the city has place seven , Luxemburg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin at No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if life &apos;s quality is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W success .
but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite a Bre@@ xit vote .
as for this , the power relations : in London , according to figures released by Landesbank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal action from hepatitis C patent with Mer@@ ck
a US president decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to the re@@ im@@ bur@@ s@@ ement of the legal costs you have developed from the ep@@ h@@ ep@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was liberated from a compensation payment in the amount of $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ drug S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a US court revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
in case of law@@ suit filed on Thursday , US president , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to issu@@ ing the costs incur@@ red during the defense of the F@@ alles .
Mer@@ ck has tried to use Gal@@ a@@ Gilead to gover@@ n the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck were accused of inter@@ oper@@ atives and property on laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , active ingredient in medicines of Gilead .

Clin@@ t earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published their tax statement on Friday that resulted in the Democrats of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton dollar donated 1 million for beneficial purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their book on their ten@@ ure at the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax expl@@ aining about the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; admitted by Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a c@@ law contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and backs on his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is custom@@ ary to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidate , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; says Clin@@ t &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats .
on Thursday , Michael Cohen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN that he would not allow Com@@ ump to publish something before the controls are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the republi@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already noted that his ref@@ usal questions arise in terms of wealth , his donations for charity organisations , business@@ men and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton already over@@ threw himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet , in which high @-@ ranking Republican Com@@ b@@ ill@@ ers to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic during a speech about the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other Presi@@ dential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid or paid only very little tax during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times stated a number of tax advis@@ ers and tax advis@@ ers , that it could still be the case .
government taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a election campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for a strike , Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ ing industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump decided to exchange a meeting in order to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the IRS and have &quot; afraid &quot; before voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign has released tax return to the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ t , which now lives in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the summit &apos;s tax return of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income rose as wages , unlike most of all Americans .
their main funds was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ t Divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were logged .

con@@ doms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work sk@@ il@@ ers support Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
Prot@@ ector in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox style to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited by people - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ters .
the method has proven to be effective and the Honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already trained the idea before years , trained together with the U.S. conservation guard , trained by volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania , a non @-@ violent quad@@ rup@@ tive method to protect their houses and harvest without animals without having to hurt animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the phone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe the eleph@@ ants of their fields , without damage the eleph@@ ants from their fields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of Honey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bubbles in a horn .
if it is not deported , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
mixed with earth , Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ z mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work in a con@@ dom which ends up to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom swe@@ eps up with a b@@ ang and spray white to Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der in the air .
a breath quite true in the rule , to hunt the elephant .
one last chance is a sc@@ aler who sho@@ ots a golf fire in the air and creates a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish director , Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; re@@ inst@@ ation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch when he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has listed no Israeli pre@@ fix since it had required Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the geographical list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
what is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ insky Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
the hotel told that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason that stood behind , dis@@ band@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix will be er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled at this event .
this is really very den@@ sely .
the fact that this has been carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a bigger shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect that the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moves the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a quite large reson@@ ance on the Internet , where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged or@@ bit@@ es of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out , that the hotel that is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel showed quickly all accus@@ ations from himself and called the incident an &quot; betra@@ yal &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , tells Der Spiegel .
there was never a direct instruction , &quot; Israel does not include a direct statement , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung continued a nar@@ r@@ ator of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code is now added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ stra@@ as &amp; Rub@@ ber Com@@ rade to protest Brazilian students .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students joined the Brazilian city in Sao Paulo together with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the reform of the government for the public education system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police put Tr@@ än@@ stra@@ as and Rub@@ ber Com@@ rade to the prot@@ esters .
the difficulty began when police officers tried to gr@@ ate the students , leading to the police , that the police inserted Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ osse and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students took part in demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the proposals of the Govern@@ ors Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , somewhat less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the participants saw V@@ et &apos;s tits against the Pre@@ liminary President Michel T@@ emer at the walls of spray .
the recent protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the sus@@ pending President Dil@@ ma R@@ ousse@@ ff , which had been revealed by a vote of the Senate on their withdrawal from the office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew sharply in the country , divided the ambassador .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
of course , further trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trading swing was reached by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian international agency took around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of the route of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran has reached the top 20 countries that affects the number of tourist cities in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists will be broken in Russia from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; personally , I recommend to visit the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrimage to the gateway of Mer@@ cy
the stran@@ ts of the Ey@@ es@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch of St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day Pil@@ gri@@ mage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were carried out .
in order to complete the time until the next Rom@@ wall@@ ets of all the ministers in the past two years , the Prime Minister of St. Anna has decided to prepare and performing a several day Pil@@ gri@@ mage .
various pilgri@@ m@@ ages was checked and we finally decided to visit the Bishop of Fri@@ bourg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , the Mer@@ chant for Mer@@ cy at the Frei@@ burger Münster was a special pilgrimage destination .
16 Min@@ is made of b@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ bl@@ ender took on the way .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and divided the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b by train on the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Un@@ ser@@ ene wife is standing and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was captured from Münster .
the single day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short pulse with different prayers , songs and lyrics .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is went to Feld@@ cru@@ ises , chap@@ els , or churches , together again and again to sing a song from a specially produced pilgri@@ m song .

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , stretching gold for cycling .
gravel &apos;s name Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the championship race spr@@ int in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took a role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to him . the young and made the legend as he stor@@ med to home a victory away from New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March at the London World Championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as an execution .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to conclude Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed , when they saw potential in the gravel , which opened itself now .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner put in the qualifying round a Olympics , but in the standing hands won the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a strategy change made a big part of the transformation , where Hin@@ des in a higher a@@ isle runner , to slow down and it is Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium .
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am here to do my best and make a name .
we have set up a Olympi@@ ad in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that he fell down to the track after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and no ob@@ jection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals came .
with such a victory there was no problem for this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which have won seven of 10 tracks both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ o@@ drome .
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for the British sport ; Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
this is the kä@@ me of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , who starts to start today and will go through three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the quick@@ est performance in four @-@ four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 on the target .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with proof of the qualification in front of the qualification , when officials called it to measure his body size .
in the respective women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team reli@@ es on his strong platform team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a look at medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
it played Dra@@ mas in the background , so the resignation of the technical conduc@@ tors Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ b@@ ing@@ les , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first night of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks very soon as the legendary reputation of G@@ BS , which has reached the perfect moment of its cli@@ max .
future of the melt from Portland due to liqui@@ dation of energy consumption
the future of aluminium mel@@ t@@ ins from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are standing on the game since the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply and thereby raise all delivery contracts , as the energy company delivered .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a maxim@@ inum payout is scheduled for 20 years .
up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are standing in the game .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
in addition , it could occur to domin@@ ance effects , as the melting temperature is consumed by approximately 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point of Henry , leading to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea force of power last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of publishing on the future of the complex , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last due to the electricity price for the facility .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mel@@ t@@ orial with his Lo@@ y Yang A Power plant in Lat@@ ine Valley , told that there are three other owners to announce their contracts .
the plant is situated in a majority ownership of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L &quot; assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to keep the contracts called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice until they end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the revenue of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong points for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L par@@ ted that it has already written the value of contracts already in its annual ab@@ uses of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book contracts , the &quot; ability of liqu@@ or ... sm@@ ack the melting or to ensure the power supply to melting &quot; do not affect .
the U.S. company said that there have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have had to come into effect from November this year , even if it is a explanation , why it is re@@ signed by the contract .
analyst war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume about 900 meg@@ awatts each year and around 900 meg@@ awatts .
if both systems disappear from the market , significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; would mean .
and for us as a power producer , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just one car@@ av@@ ans of reality TV @-@ Star , B@@ ander@@ a is based on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
B@@ ander@@ a brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der is and she ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , I gave me the sight of this Co@@ vers to weep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote B@@ ander@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like this ) , the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z On@@ k@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ending with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the cl@@ ut@@ ee@@ pers action of virtually every birthday party ( Se@@ ac@@ re@@ mn@@ ant brought the sentence , &quot; You knew that we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to give her other girl somehow to this public@@ ity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , safety has started a new era of car@@ av@@ ans .
Kend@@ alls Big sister Kim may be concerned about what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( they and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles more a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output is a large number of advertis@@ ers &apos; ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his cover stars is expected to see that in the last two years pictures of the journal still le@@ ak@@ ened before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break@@ able model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - is described under the former category , it is in good society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous individuals or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything was allocated to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who character@@ ize in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to anyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ inger &apos;s position was always ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the London &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleagues critic@@ ised Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and she called her &quot; the mist@@ aken of the moment . &quot;
these feelings come up again , when the message came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding on the failure seems to pass by the point .
B@@ ander@@ a is based on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it does advertising for your pri@@ mer basis by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
and all her sisters sell pictures of their respective Pay@@ pal apps .
she sells handmade pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in their free time she &apos;s to be seen in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
yearly about 160@@ ,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s need of aux@@ ili@@ ary Cent@@ res are dismissed by the communal centres , while the industry has already reli@@ ed on the effects of further aver@@ ures .
in Queensland three of five individuals - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ fair Del@@ og@@ ations and the like - have been rejected at their request for free legal advice and jurisdiction .
legal services of the municipality , which are already effective , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centres are expected to lose a further 30 percent of their federal agents .
the Managing Director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal coun@@ ters revealed that thousands of people have already rejected thousands of people every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse , without the decision of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ lands Community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who were un@@ ju@@ stly released - all these people have problems of correct manner and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the federal government will be cut by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of aid people from Queensland will be forced to justify their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand the General Prosecutor and Bundes@@ jus@@ tiz@@ ens and the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to capture these aver@@ ages immediately , so people may need the help you need to obtain legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled their commitment to lift funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centres and its customers as well as the Government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey conducted by country elections : SPD and CD@@ U
significant losses for government parties in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) are characterised by significant losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CD@@ U .
this was representative p@@ olls of the opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey cases in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to keep the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collapsed from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
the party demonstrates that the survey was just under the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 per cent again .
the third place is fought between the left and the AF@@ D .
the left would come to 19 per cent ( previously : 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time .
the Green Party in spite of slight losses involving 6 percent ( previously : 8.7 percent ) returns to the s@@ ard@@ ine country day .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented at the Land@@ tag each with 3 percent .
according to the Department of Dep@@ u@@ ties of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD won only 23 per cent of the survey ( 2011 : 21.@@ 8.3 per cent ) .
only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 percent reached the CD@@ U .
they were still annoying after the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and larger , it was therefore not good in his hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty big .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ abytes , that would be rich today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone will now be delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euro lovers can buy the devices at the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover , Germany , as &quot; office in the Western @-@ bottle format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails sent and received , even by fax , the Communic@@ ator was to reach .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser when also agon@@ ising slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital add@@ ress@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be looked similar to a laptop .
then found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 2700 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 euros .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody could see in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the Fin@@ n &apos;s mobile division experienced an un@@ parall@@ eled disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and worked .
the market today control providers which all came a lot later than Nokia .
always available online , that is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion units sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
the global turnover of the units is about 400 billion euros .
to do this , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app provider and the telecommunications corporations come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around the smartphone , a whole industry has grown into the meantime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the major breakthrough towards the mass market came in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World to launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , everything by touch @-@ screen easy to use .
the winner of Apple began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the thought .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
these are now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a self @-@ understand@@ ability .
on average , every German now has 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all the smartphone even though , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , responsible for the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must len@@ ose the Olympic Spirit and expand Heath@@ row
Heath@@ row is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London , but bring prosperity throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , just as we run in London in 2012 when we run a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be accessible again by creating new opportunities for local and companies near Heath@@ row .
for our local communities we will already employ 10,000 new teachers , creating a 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as she predic@@ ts us in London 2012 , there will be such that will think that the challenge of expanding Heath@@ row &apos;s challenge is too large .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that England never will be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ pered on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two @-@ fl@@ yers had in@@ justice in 2012 and they are also wrong with Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to the f@@ ooth@@ ills , but Heath@@ row answers every asked question .
like the Olympic Games , Heath@@ row is for many and not a infrastructure project .
expansion is an option to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and a legacy of skills and jobs in order to leave the airport as well as in whole UK .
we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequency cat@@ walk of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by a £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the addition of Heath@@ row &apos;s extension is also being one .
it is time that we extend this Olympic spirit and extend Heath@@ row as well as to secure our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and jobs , which can be proud of England .

add @-@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; Cat and mouse game &quot; on display recor@@ ders
for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturer attempts to b@@ ypass display recor@@ ders , a &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; immediately .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be an indication on its des@@ kt@@ ops , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it would like to update its filters in the program for blocking advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook dealt with that his dis@@ kt@@ ops would change the coding regarding his advertising not@@ ices to detect the indication that part of the page advertising is to make it difficult .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent new codes .
in a blog post , the nar@@ r@@ ator of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Lord struggle between the appealing Open Source community and the conver@@ ters have been underway since the invention of advertis@@ ers is underway , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company dedicated to social media in the struggle is a strong indi@@ z , as wor@@ rying indicators for the industry .
according to a study by Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , according to a study by the last year of Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe has 200 million people ad pic@@ ks ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , hand @-@ advertisement is 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company doesn &apos;t have any effect on ad recor@@ ders on desktop PCs because mobile ad recor@@ ders have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large share of revenues , giving Facebook the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared Facebook that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have more control over them to quote their advertis@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that ad@@ min &apos;s new filters would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertis@@ ements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is no positive experience , therefore , we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a letter of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indication blocks are a bl@@ unt means why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police ev@@ okes witnesses after spending a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 area close to Morges in the canton of Wa@@ adt shortly after midnight .
a woman in Dun@@ kl@@ en found himself in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police declared in Wa@@ adt .
it is obvious that a Swiss franc at the age of 49 , which was by several vehicles , including a truck car , wanted to kill himself .
they passed away on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , the police declared that these as well as any witnesses of the incident happened to us .
it was opened an investigation procedure , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was an interference avoid@@ able ?
this is something that must decide the public prosecutor , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter .
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers won &apos;t be moved to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - where a person in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to go out that a pede@@ stri@@ ans walk in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman of the prop@@ elled killing was acquitted when she had killed a man and killed one night at the A1 , near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and has been un@@ conscious of the street .
the court noted that the polic@@ eman had answered an ob@@ itu@@ ary way -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was once inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms , similar to those of clim@@ atic research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have been her@@ edit@@ ary conditions .
scientists have previously stated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , similar atmosphere , and slowly turned away slowly .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet thought to be more dry areas than the earth , but had once enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from faster ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus reaches its daily side of the sun almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io declared in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of the sun heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are a few degrees of cooler than Earth today .
the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution , previously suspected of planetary researchers .
although it was likely to be inhab@@ itable , the Venus -- in the course of several billion years , was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans di@@ gest@@ ed and their water vap@@ or was burned down by the ultra@@ violet light .
when you abandoned hydro@@ gen only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy joined the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che in Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che .
alternatively , the president / General manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and understood that the club is immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have completed my duties as CEO and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position .
in the course of summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth to give it a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of Team and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be adapted perfectly to the organization .
he must also have a contribut@@ or right to decisions which influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me today on this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season with the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at Western Conference by five points .
the Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart has won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two tracks with Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers will return to talks again , strike your strike
the labour struggles for the re@@ mun@@ eration of North Sea workers will be exposed while all parties are putting together for a new round of discussion on the table , said negoti@@ ator .
strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; Wood Group , as well as the un@@ ites , and the trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the un@@ winding process of the current stri@@ ving process , &quot; says it in a common statement .
we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the next few weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year to re @-@ rise the problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike that is the first in more than 25 years is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wood Group has cut the rates of its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company needed the required room to come across the market .
as a result , Shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since its business activities are ration@@ alized as a consequence of its meg@@ ac@@ tionary regime with the BG Group BG Group .
as a result of lower raw oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation , resulting from the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish member of Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest disp@@ utes in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending will be expected in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler is the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Kepler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of star@@ ters .
the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in star@@ fish are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context of the rotary @-@ time zones .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ ing of our results with other star@@ ters , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s inf@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the shooting gallery of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ thood .
they are now on the fastest .
this mature stars show large quantities of star@@ ches .
as this win@@ ch are traveling through the stars of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star is al@@ oud , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each cluster , by identi@@ fying the time between the show of a recogni@@ zable star@@ chy -- like sunshine .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that a more massive stars are slower than less massive stars .
vineyards compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see that slow rot@@ ors have ten@@ ding to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors are ten@@ ding to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star@@ ters of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades Star@@ line offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars are slow down their rot@@ ations , and so to say their &quot; dancing shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star tre@@ k down
tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez faster than the US @-@ bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional return period , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be performing the Tri@@ ko@@ t Yan@@ ke@@ es in New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye to &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodriguez became the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature is signed up to 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the Counter@@ kts on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full levels .
as a player , Rodriguez had long time with power .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two other bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics found in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be included in the rest of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodriguez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversial its occurr@@ ence outside of the square .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the Super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was said to have forbidden ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspect for years over an anti @-@ aging hospital in South Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done me for the year 2014 even a favor , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodriguez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless too .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage once again , Rodriguez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win each game , &quot; corro@@ sive Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodriguez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az , and actress Kate Hudson has been told by the singer Kate Hudson , sympathy with the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ ri@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the trailer for the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodriguez team .
Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first d@@ oping cases
sm@@ elling : because of a positive d@@ oping test , he will not launch the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping cases .
an inv@@ aded athl@@ ete won almost one medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official d@@ oping cases in Rio de Janeiro became known .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metres steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil - immediately before the start of the athle@@ tics competition , these messages come to the un@@ time .
last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de had been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked tool for d@@ oping test instances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ al@@ Tribunal CA@@ S confirmed their decision from the Olympic Games in Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just around 0.0@@ 9 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en was supposed to participate in the pre@@ mat@@ uring over 50 m Freestyle .
Ch@@ en has submitted the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands Ch@@ en full cooperation with investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will collabor@@ ate with the International Sport@@ court Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the message was le@@ ased through the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old himself went to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to deal with the banned substance against blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ers EP@@ O .
after B@@ NT , Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been sus@@ pending , according to B@@ NT , the B test should have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow promp@@ ted immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ eni@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not pull the right battles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , approximately all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ iers may not be part of the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ing@@ loaded nation in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky , &quot; also known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both the intake of taking , however , are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa &apos;s case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world federation had under@@ stated the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic d@@ oping d@@ oping the start , Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the bu@@ oy@@ ancy , the former Ver@@ sions in China had also made public disp@@ utes between athletes as well .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Freestyle I will pass over me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of a meditation on the Australian M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers her solution
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware currently attack targeted companies - and are successful .
according to a current survey of the malware anti @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months , partially with multiple victims of an ex@@ tor@@ tion software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the firms already had a target of a ran@@ som@@ y@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims were willing to will@@ ingly prepare the solv@@ ents required to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize the ex@@ tor@@ tion software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes in corporate networks .
if they succeed there , the potential solution is considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the pollut@@ ant software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the ex@@ tor@@ tion software for themselves .
only private nut@@ zer were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary quickly in the past months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer &apos;s computer , it is looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als in a sustainable manner .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ tic bit@@ coin .
but where with private users the personal photo @-@ database is available on the game , there is a sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls off when a ran@@ som@@ ite strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent , even the business activity had to break completely , in case there were people in danger of life .
in Germany there were already several hospitals victims , whose patients can be threatened by loss of patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not pay , you promote only the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the call of the perpet@@ rators .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure investig@@ ators have examined the user surface and contact the com@@ press@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money .
they explain their victims per chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , free online support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files .
and they are delivered to payments of a few hundred euros , companies must act as hard , and pay five digit sum@@ s to get their data un@@ turn@@ able .
in view of potentially high and relatively ris@@ ti@@ tious gains out of the rank@@ ings , the h@@ ack@@ ers always get professional and share the work , explains security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ y@@ ware within a week . &quot;
likely it is , however , that it is three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software in the form of a software building cast@@ ings to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware Kits were created by the malware itself , advis@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool which can be changed to smaller configur@@ ations , appearance , and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on the possible many PCs .
payment is made per in@@ adequ@@ ately calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals refer to the spread of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that provide their data better .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT users in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to resist using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of the data is no sufficient threat to successful awakening , the perpet@@ rators are threatened instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the compensation potential , depending on the type of data , a multiple higher than before .
we could also make the perpet@@ rators completely new goals in the Internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they were able to get one with the connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the free folding of such blocked heating may well be a rans@@ om value .
if the perpet@@ rators then block a whole production line instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday dust
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the vers@@ atility of a mini@@ vans .
it sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually proved very flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it works closely .
the materials of the interior are well processed and feel comfortable , only the cockpit top falls out there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
it is not only a trunk @-@ trunk of 4@@ 53 l , and 10@@ 26 l is available at rec@@ tan@@ gled back @-@ proof , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat areas of the back@@ rest can be open up like cinema arm@@ chairs and therefore offer storage space , which is high from floor up to 1,@@ 24 m high .
the boot room can be well @-@ loaded , however , the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to a torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
he is likely to have a little more quiet , however .
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gra@@ ti@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is likely to be more direct .
the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; Executive &quot; cannot be desired .
among the safety systems the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision alarm system and the spine assistant .
the coll@@ ision swar@@ ms are sometimes irrit@@ ated , because he rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ess objects . &quot;
very reliable works of the district assistant .
and the intelligent tem@@ per controller is respon@@ ding to the traffic sign detection and imp@@ ose the speed if needed .
but the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack are below the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward .
some 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel engines are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline at 20,000 euros , the diesel off 23@@ ,000 euros .
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday suit@@ ability car .
Air@@ line is not responsible : down@@ fall to passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
because a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only for dangers which are typical for air traffic , the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken the knee with the fall .
however , the accident could happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as judgment .
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease incident : when pays the organizer
sick leave , after their journey , get money back when the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate to be found in the hotel .
but that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ating case a family was heavily ill in diar@@ rhoea , diarrhea and vomiting .
she spent nearly the entire holiday in the room .
their disease led the holi@@ day@@ makers back on a defective small f@@ oll@@ ard , which allegedly contam@@ inated the sea water .
the family was the view that was lacking to be poor - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ ers .
before the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the se@@ wage plant was in fact defective .
but the organizer was first experienced before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to go out until then that sea@@ water was fine .
he didn &apos;t viol@@ ate his information , so judgment .
together , no imp@@ urities were found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red through cont@@ ag@@ ion among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 people were ill .

&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister is clear to action against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel &apos;s newspapers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

better traffic flow on the highway exit
it st@@ ole regularly on the stra@@ ci@@ on road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal system should be extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good news for all the car drivers who stand on the road traffic on the surrounding road every evening , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road operation runs leng@@ th@@ ens on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ er Straße is the right @-@ to @-@ end track by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Road right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , making the total of circulation on the varied section of the Federal Road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger is nervous , especially between 17 and 19 .
the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ven@@ er and sometimes also goes beyond .
reason is the needle @-@ clock on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic is only tra@@ pped on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be back well in three years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge has no longer the required load bearing , in order to absorb heavy traffic two .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that linked to the connected St@@ au is not to say .
however , with years to calculate : because the bridge has an official remaining time until 20@@ 34 .
for extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction unit , the state @-@ operation is deliberately searching for traffic weak@@ est time in school holidays because of disability .
traffic will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday at the building site .
interactive travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the association Nim@@ a &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a musical project now .
the association Nim@@ a &apos;s enables young people to visit cultural institutions in Münster , with a refugee and refugee background .

most of the students of the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria come to Münster and have little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it would have been possible to follow the course of course , so the press release of the boy the@@ aters Münster .

rain instead of shooting stars : hope on weather improves
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a year by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the heaven &apos;s spectacle , said the chair@@ woman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we will see many star@@ ters in the sky .
these stars are decorated with the stars that include 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometres per hour , one of the fastest shooting stars .
their names have they , because they apparently come from the constellation of Per@@ seus coming in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , one walks etern@@ ally around , at night you wake up in the morning , just before the wake @-@ up cl@@ aps no longer think of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , you have problems with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than 10 percent , their sleep often finds its sleep frequently or not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and many causes are under@@ lying , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ep , Member of the Board of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Sch@@ la@@ ff@@ lement und Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understand is , however , is never the In@@ som@@ nia , meaning a single and a sleeping disorder .
just going through , many people feel as an un@@ freeze or inadequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the member of the German Haus@@ er Association with Practice in Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ ours are able to use drugs , but also medications .
not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake up is common for depression often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors require one another .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and starts to sal@@ v@@ ably , about everyday problems and worry , there is no example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should we use sleep disorders to the doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a month of at least three nights per week , should not sleep well and a day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es we@@ aving .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look completely different : one is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ finished , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache .
in order to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to figure out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , a cog@@ nitive behavi@@ oral therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - in@@ query .
in Germany , he hardly empha@@ sizes in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ber , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason , one should first apply at sleeping difficulties , advis@@ es we@@ aving .
this can clari@@ fy with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
who should be at sleep laboratory , and what happens ?
for investigation in a sleep laboratory medical device , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory vi@@ ability , at sleep allow@@ ance , or if you cannot find the cause of a sleeping disorder is not explained .
you don &apos;t need to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; don &apos;t make a lunch sleep &quot; , &quot; Fi@@ ber says .
after turning down , one goes to his normal time into bed .
in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a no@@ bl@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap , and a F@@ üh@@ ler on the finger .
in addition , a camera shows the ceiling on the ceiling .
how do people able to handle the handle in the handle ?
there are quite many screws , where you can get for a better sleep .
white is on : regular sleeping and rise , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep in bed , don &apos;t watch television to sleep , avoid drinking alcohol , and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s quite and absolutely not .
what the jungle camp has missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold himself by Facebook to dis@@ appo@@ inting the DS@@ V teams in Olymp@@ is .

now the former DS@@ V @-@ athl@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler now put his cont@@ acting on the explosion @-@ based Ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where a Olympic champion receives 20,000 € Premium and one jungle heads 150,000 € was wonder@@ ing no one about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 year old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good , however .
with this we can not compete with countries that can promote very much and even run on d@@ oping with the topic D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
it is exactly how you should keep it with countries .

airport : gang of luggage arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the airport Düsseldorf
the Düsseldorf police seized the arrest of two women and two men in the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several T@@ ash@@ - and Bag@@ gage steels as a gang .
against 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognized in the area of Düsseldorf at the airport of Düsseldorf a gang that had been known to police officers from last theft of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ ences since mid @-@ July and had collabor@@ ated in general , collabor@@ ative and especially professional .
the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ al 34 of the crimes of crimes committed to Germany , the specialists of crimes committed by off@@ ences to Germany were able to prove four acts .
in doing so , they were exploited more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , some lenti@@ l pools , in between another head of cob@@ ble@@ stone roads : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in appears at first sight not so , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you walk along the east along the east , you come to playing fields , a refresh@@ ment kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone has spra@@ yed at the facade of a gray house &quot; ugly ! &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be disman@@ tled , it is already built : by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be created .
in recent weeks , article about this fashionable &quot; trendy &quot; housing estate is called Friedrichsha@@ in , but will be illustrated by burning cars in the last weeks .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the inhabitants of rent contracts , on the ground floor are occupied still spaces and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been referred to as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Go Zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence since the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 22 June the premises on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ sch@@ mie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cleared out , pat@@ rol the police three weeks later , with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin @-@ administrative court ruled that the ev@@ ac@@ uation had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the cheers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves ahead of late .
in immediate proximity of the hood projects there are a primary school and kinder@@ g@@ art@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1999 , especially from the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the residents of the hood , they share the care of increasing r@@ ents and mag@@ ically .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; Kie@@ z , who wanted to pick up mostly police protection from v@@ and@@ alism .
the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator and the police make up their neighbours , obviously doesn &apos;t exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working area , which is also evident in comparison to the rest of the city a humili@@ ation and high poverty risk .
buildings and new@@ born residential projects are already part of the &quot; Kie@@ z : &quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic , including almost the whole Main@@ zer street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared among large police officers in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and partly still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has increasingly become a mag@@ nets for tourists and ball@@ ers from around the world : with them the inhabitants of GDR times and former household her@@ etics are sharing their &quot; Kie@@ z . &quot;
this also makes itself noticeable for the owners who have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them in designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been thrown off with colours .
no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
a reason that not all neighbours can see it as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body inj@@ uri@@ ous statistics , according to polic@@ ing statistics , is almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the crimes are making property damages , the ten@@ ci@@ ally more re@@ model@@ ings and newly renovated homes .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , uncertainty may not be any talk of uncertainty .
in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that were certainly not meant to be .
even the famous burning cars make it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect of architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , live together on the street and gets more each other than wo@@ und@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
therefore , it was so important that the natives return their streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July .
however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : due to un@@ imagin@@ able new@@ buildings in former buildings , that push the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well booked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I absolutely not have gu@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should I do , if one never stops someone ?
there , fru@@ strations arise on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , has little understanding : the skin objects and the left scene belonged to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who moves , should be aware of his - just like someone who pul@@ ls in a pub quarter to complain about a noise .
all characters presented only with the first names are asked to be called the name of their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the management of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it looks as the contact partner for all actors : refugees , working , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else are still missing .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteer work is more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ ver@@ le is now there , the eager Woll@@ um@@ ig@@ au , that has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cked on the multitude of responsibilities - targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the place .
looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , an en@@ viable rug style .
but administration work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
especially it is about organization , working with the people on the spot , and behind the scenes as well as power stations .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ver@@ le Ehr@@ en- and main actors supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human , and understanding problems .
new containers in W@@ as@@ en@@ straße soon stand
a serious problem , it has been recognized for some time to find apartments for connecting @-@ fle@@ eing that have been recognized .
the Commun@@ es are responsible for connecting frames .
you must under@@ take the refugees in their own or rented residential homes .
the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations need to carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ try@@ side office in the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search is designed for some time as very difficult .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work until now , if you rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , gener@@ ously need to be re@@ vil@@ ed , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers are installed in W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agre@@ es .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are intern@@ ships , training courses , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pless activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that &apos;s motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes the work of joint action leads to a positive effect .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
activity , however , does not only mean work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ ver@@ le and Customer .
people would have to develop a remedy .
so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so you jump here to administration and volunteer .
it was central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
you must explain the refugees that it takes , and it will be able to complete the time , for example with language courses .
those who sometimes evol@@ ve the feeling he could not work in Ur@@ bach nobody , don &apos;t work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate .
the clear majority are motivated .
but there are also problem cases , the customer says , &quot; People , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work by Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer are therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this was already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine says clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what man@@ cher nai@@ ve may call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resi@@ due course could and would not exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents have been subject to the refugees .
they would be afraid that the assass@@ in , they bring them completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so major and volunteer volunteer do have to look for activities in the region and in the region .
in doing so , they have always been in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
