<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - this is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential seekers are, however, in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton lies a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Der, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thus, Trump wants to keep the doubt rather small and warns against it that the state can harm the economy - with tax and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to kill the economy and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But he himself would be different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will regain regulators, and it is strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to meet, he has offered disadvantaged opportunities to open, and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes were increased to the rich, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost worshipping.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic application announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics, and are rejected by the state-ritic Teachy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, there could be still parties in internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and back up the coal generation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in far-protected areas to terminate the Paris Climate Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">In contrast with its investment programme, Clinton wants to strengthen the renewable energy and demands: "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, both competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Nazifish trade agreement, they do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both the United States would not insulate from international trade, but simply protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, for instance by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present wage of $7,25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, The minimum wage must be, he says, he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the control policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to boost the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics hold it before, so the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton likes to demand that at least from the rich men wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="23">"men flee for wars, because they are politically persecuted because of their torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe," she tells.</seg>
<seg id="24">In women, there are other reasons for the escape: "many stealing themselves secretly, because they don't see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience dealing with sexual violence, forced, Honour, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is what drives them away.</seg>

<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Who believe that when they come to Germany in Germany, please tell Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">There are also women in refugee shelters often regarded as inferior and abstenance in refugee camps.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich district, traumatized, it appreciates her.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of Assistenzologists have called for their union to approve new labour measures in its disputes over a new agreement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of foreign sideways"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give his hands and to proclaim a official end of the eight months of war and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I can not spoil myself of intrucks that Ankara wants to most reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a towel, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked intimidated and he has barely heat, even for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report of five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have been so benevolent than would never happen to happen.</seg>
<seg id="11">After me, his enthusiasm rather seemed to signify the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin bewittering, sustainable Kühle showed that Russia's head of state forgot nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction: the shooting of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was decisively branded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin has divided and accused Ankara, who fell to his back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even greater, since it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is difficult to rebuild the Vetropes if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media introduced a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At once, it seemed like the Turks would bear debt for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious officials from senior officials accused that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in the territories of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He disputed this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin was receiving the President of Erdogan, who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire is clear by hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is required first of all friends that he can get after spending the last month with a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Counter-attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal occasions of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the television enthusiast predicted fruits and vegetables, once the Turkish agricultural imports are again permitted.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West, since its reaction to the tried power demand was considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">For this purpose, the persisting resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike that is piping out into the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "the Russian head of state, in Ankara, won a bonus for sure that he requested a coup d" "" "coup" "" "by the attempted coup" "" "coup" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is well-noticed for Moscow is a matter of matter which, even a profound fear of regimes, has changed.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit at this glamorous palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, an analyst who once described me an analyst "Alliance of foreign sideways": two countries that have been treated in the west and treated badly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey will support both sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents were said at the press conference, that they did not take the theme once.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey missed it clearly on a question about their differences, while Putin chose to stress this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common Nenner can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than NATO member of Turkey enjoyed the Russian combat jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="2">Dettori spends champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit</seg>
<seg id="3">On Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3.000th British gain at the Newmarket.</seg>
<seg id="4">He placed on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey which reaches the milestone in the flat race.</seg>
<seg id="6">He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester's Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.</seg>
<seg id="7">The three-day winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said: "it's something special."</seg>
<seg id="8">I am very emotional because my family is here too</seg>
<seg id="9">I am very happy about it that it was done with Newmarket because I arrived here 30 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is not a big meeting, it is not Royal Ascot - it is a banaler Friday night with 20.000 people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am relieved and very modest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Dettori takes the cheers when he brings to victory at Predilection</seg>
<seg id="13">Two Jockeys have achieved the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy who scored more than 4,300 victories in a rekord-breaking career.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lester: Piggott, the Ninth Derbysieger had 4,493 careers</seg>
<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best Jockey of Modernism and it's no surprise that he has reached this milestone only a few in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect, who differs it from the other in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma delighted fans since years now for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he had already brought 6.000 winnings if he would not just be a weekend and big turnierjockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has already lost nearly 30 years of winners, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">Flying from Flying Finishes for Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the suspension of the British flat tree for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerventional.</seg>
<seg id="24">A number of big turnists win, including his famous "glorious Seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug-ban.</seg>
<seg id="25">Three years ago, at first he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive strength to withstand his doubts and return to his top shape.</seg>

<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a position of the Kremlin it is that Putin has ordered Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian President's administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been in charge of Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, he graduated in the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was the leader and head of government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of government to support your actions as head of state and controls on implementing your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made a mysterious man in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time to become one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet secret services, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returns to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, here are just a few of them - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted to the potential president once, to the Russian environmental policy - met great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin that's cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked you to talk to this very complicated post at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - complaining about four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian President's administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), he was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people to whom he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third office of Putin had tried to violate the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North-deck of the Queensboro cross country with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now associated with fife.</seg>

<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for passover.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the total bridge decks on their place and the last section of the decks gets a betongation for the deck, which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted up at the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project makes the shutter for forward-looking high and deep construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installation of the last road cover and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or landing page.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern tip bridge 700 millimeters south of the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>

<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig in the coming years will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "action concept living" for the next installment.</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy has been programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First, it is about the question: who should actually build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Christoph Bratmann said: "we are talking to the Green Party:" we want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments have to be found as social flats. "</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can, however, arise in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The large troops in the town hall is, however, Bratmann: "how are you dealing with investors that want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors at a minimum of 10 percent, but as if possible 20 percent of the apartments are building as a social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing project program which will cost millions and needs to be financed, shall be applied to incentives.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "" "" "the CDU wants to make investors as a few rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left doesn't want toughness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of this, so violi, has a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">The project concept is implemented, that will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not entirely updated: because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of more than 1300 favorable apartments, whose funding will come out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, the planing chair Nicole Palm, should now be purchased out of the city for ongoing ties.</seg>

<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Just: we don't want to have the owners, the housing societies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social dwellings in the Western city is drastically increased, it is removed from the aim of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social security in just a few neighborhoods.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating, as the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and child do not go out to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time with, on screens, was mourn over the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about to get people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the beginning, the screen was on TV, then on video games, and most recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I am referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, a app based on the characteristics that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later there were created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of popculture sank the interest in the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside and search for Pokémons that will be tracked with a GPS once they were once found, "photographed" (above a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was still younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the searches from the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps taken from the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, a app for Apple Watch, followed by the Washington Post recently informed that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by, who followed every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for improved performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public clarifying campaigns to health, people want to bring "up to 30 minutes" to come from the sofa "and" to be active every day "struggled on deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look stunning.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport cannot be reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly casts sports, reduces its chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to perform it here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">This way, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close up even new girlfriendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also lyrical toys that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone might run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has become a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">New will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games to join the apps and virtual reality with the activator in the real world, and will help many people in the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexuals of the American who wins a multi-campaign and overall the fifth, while they consolidate their reputation, the best of their generation or even ever.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success represents the same league as a unique athlete, such as Michael Phelps, who have brought her sports for new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bilo dominates her sport for the last three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she was "the best gymnast that I have ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected to be a final examination in Brazil, a contest that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans of Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace her, after having won gold and silver in the single campaign of women in art at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, respectively.</seg>

<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more campaign competition since the summer of 2013, a victory game that will hold so long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if the Mustafina caused by two rotations, the picture mured.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish bales and plantations - in which Biles holds the world championship title - laude.</seg>

<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her Endergite - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles glossy red, white and blue Eyeliner, as the vision they once described in their collection book, to reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team capitated, called "grandma" by Americans, had a lead advantage.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their soil, she threw up the audience of Kusshes, overwhelmed by a comeback that was sometimes desperate.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three turists, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, inspired by many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, the Catholics in is round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has consolidated the black and hispan female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the past four years, number one was one of the female turists.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion in America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the unbelievable performance of three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, as she gave unexpected, yet masterfully Gymastheroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual combined event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but you don't see turnouts throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie struck all the same way as Aly and Madison, to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic Games have only four Turns in the crew. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But reality looks like that Turns will unite the expensive sport and Turner first in private numbers that are maintained by parents, that will come up for training, education, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the coach and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnaround are lying in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner will receive its entire training and that's a expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started working with the tower.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to enable the congregations of Aun countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-reach gym trainers.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my Turnhalle of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 people urban youngsters (especially black and Hispanic) and national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we are expanding into Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth of high-quality Turns to learn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport class and benefit.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turns develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, who bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymnasants and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you for making it so many young girls with different background to start their way to start healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance in Assists want to organise other strikes, after having rejected Jeremy Hunting proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 Assistenologists, who voted in a vote, refused him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt plans revealed that the treaty was forced to introduce the contract and said that the NHS was found in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance systems should receive a new contract, which contains modifications to night and weekly working, to improve maintenance times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committees for Assistenzologists held last night in a communication with: "assistance to the proposed contract, in particular that it is present to heat the current occupation crisis and it is parted to treat all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">At just eight weeks that still remain, until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts from the BMA to solve disputes by talks struggled with the government to participate in the government and sometimes on ointangible silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the place of one thing that Jeremy Hunt made about it last month, that his door would always be offended.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must now act, raising the penetration and speak the concerns of assistance in Assists."</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do this, it is clear that Assistenzologists have made clear that they are ready to carry out more labour measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, since health nurses and specialist doctors have been involved in order to grant doctors on the strike chain cover.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by the adoption of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better week remuneration for the 54.000 assistance systems that are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS staff, called for assistance in Assistensists to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "labour measures will achieve nothing but little, but already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare patients, nursing and their families only worries, need and interruption." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past two months, we talked to the Committee of Assistensists and talked with the Ministry of Health and other ministries on the concerns of the mundane and the Whistleblowings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers are hoping that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as horror, flexibility for training, training courses and gender pay for training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training courses and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with BMA in November, February and May were.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler underlined his immune system and diggereflex a serious test - selling some of the dirty and most disgusting places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shifted his way to a euro banknotes, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing pot of fine toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before using every object, he used a luminometer to show and show us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea, to lease the rinsing pot of a drawbar that has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts on the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as over his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he leaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money at railway stations, up to scrubbing of toilets, the task assigned to its immune system definitively under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told: "as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health is concerned and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified in his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample screed showed a luminometric score of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminometer count is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse, after their luminometric count amounted to 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel agent "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number at different places like the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I've got to go in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not touch here, because it is inside a disgusting room.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company pays homage to Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says, "We wanted to really offer something new for the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and at the same time explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We caught mad brainstorings, which thus ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide the consumers more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film's direction, added:" "" "let me say so - I have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I have asked him to leak such as the disgusting russian toilet that is shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course, there were things that it was easier to bring Ian to attach them and others, with which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents were associated with lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they have at least occasionally use products that included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing of the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the national day.</seg>

<seg id="6">The locals who are to be convinced of the polling men are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers traveling in the country are on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not allowed to choose the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">To do this, practical problems: the helpers who inflames posters, balloons and flyers are distributed at the end of voices, only mühevacuate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September 2016, the election and last week's day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to fight for just under the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if one can say that, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now evident in polls behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer will cut AFD and remains the same at the end of the alithic suitability.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one sees of his major posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spread roses and chatted a little with the people, as it is already his legendary worshifter predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy," "" "We create that" "" "accelerates the rise of the populists, which is believed to cost him now." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its peak candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if you are doing wrong time at the right place election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited twice a chancellor Angela Merkel by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany, listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise the Northeast CDU does not abstain from the usual election events on market places and before shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, coking says, plays only a "subordinated role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The union also noted that you take the basis of the country, that it must be very strict, to find a wire to the people.</seg>
<seg id="26">You are just like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the mountains of the country hardly exist.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the Council of the CDU-Elector Kokert to his Mitstreiter is also self-larvingly: "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is much on the stake, Sellering has called up his SPD into a particularly dedicated campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under AFD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD gained clear from 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, smallest party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the jump into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of your holidays, creating a huge campaign into the Internet.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination disks: who is buying records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you come to a comment, to overseduce it under the pseudonym of non-Alledwarn ages with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the redevelopment of records of records are not limited to a boom in millennials, which would welcome the curiosity of physical objects, but due to mid-life-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all pre-view at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysammers - it has an emotional significance: older sketries retain their feelings rather to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I carry a modest gray suit, a modest gray suit, before I stand to stick, my hands hold and something identifying what I say: "so let's take a close look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Sohos joins its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers had been based - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate your age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55 I read by Sister Ray (Data: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (Data: eight men middle-age, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to buy, when he appeared and again buy objects when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things which I probably was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It's true to those who buy disks, rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my master.</seg>
<seg id="22">Wez, 25 who works with Sister Ray, also believe that many customers that he hits to the Yougov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhances, people who have heard about the comeback and let themselves see their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the discussions that I have led, people usually have emptied their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to the trapping of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record transactions are a soothing community of equestants.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to Wez, some of the older customers attended the contactless payments system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record enthusiasts will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw the stability of familiar silentical items, from objects, happy events of youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think it can sometimes be the colt of a void or the property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "said Wez." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector, and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to be mentally engaging.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "there is a staff of a platform stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record for the last month they haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% had a record players who never use them while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while passing through a stack to Bossa Nova coma.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three men middle-aged age) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone first came up here and said," "" "I had no record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead records, so that I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not elderly, which are not very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I am purified.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and women's middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the foreseen stores - Wild Beasts, the latest synthesiology and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz drates from the speakers - is it good to see such diversatility among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">No one of them looks like lonely lonely, but nagged psychotic traumas are badly detectable if you stand next to somebody for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around for a few minutes in the business and viewed the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She is more a shovenbumblebee as a big purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, so the collecting records are not real option, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or any way, but the beauty of records is... it drives with a really loved epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, of which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the registration to mustar the jeans hotpants, I woke up a group of young teens, which take a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buying a Crosley record players.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees her in - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to express it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "sheet art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most important for luxury objects such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research shows that the results of Yougov vote, they leave at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record liking, which exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebees through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while leaving the gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who rises above the shoulders of age-aged men's middle ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live down.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a court hearing this week the authorities argued that the state should carry out 72 temporary shops selling shops, selling hairy services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would be a parallel economy, which would be paid out of taxes and pay a fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals distributed by the government supported association and other groups, do not provide enough food for growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">In addition, they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional stores, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais Prefecture will be absolutely comprehensible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes, and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live "in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the area of quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the precipitation was the Jungle Book Kids's Café of the camp, public-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as a advice about asylum items for the hundreds of protection-needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain during the 7-year-old Rugby came in the final on Thursday night at a sled stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Fiji he divided a masterclass in the handling, side stepping, reputching, liner run and roher strength to win gold - her first Olympic Medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was failed by the not too bad consolation prize of silver medal - the fourth in that day - and they couldn't be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals of the same day could fall back to her in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in this form, a 15-man team would have been in the form of this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite tomorrow a gold medal for his neck: Fijis director Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan each game in Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">They lost only one one here.</seg>
<seg id="11">This slack will hurt, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Fiji, wonderfull and left the attacks GBS from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you run in driving buses. the World Series winner went to top 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With another four minutes season, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has barely hit the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa a third gate to achieve, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touch down, and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the back pfiff and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou precleared out another weak tactings of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is so, when Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB still has to be joined.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to the half-time and concluded the fijianian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started a trial for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went back for a long time in favour of the South-Consulate, whose fans cheeks, fests and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the gambling approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame set the i-dot with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle and the whistle, the Fijis revolted and turn crushing down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Early on the day, Fiji had defeated in the semifinals with 20-5 defeated and Britain urged South Africa to hit the race-final match of the race - the Great Britain conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the items in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late spot of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more engine gold than in those games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing boat to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it were only those who were sitting at the rudder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was there as she became the second Olympiad in the two, without tax, the first women in the history of British sports that put on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, however, its 39.ter unlagged deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athlets that gliding over the surface with the elegance of gay, which is not reflected the kind of triumphes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing is a batallion to content helpers that make up the difference and there was no more dangerous than the trainer, who would not survive this day at all, when cancer was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky what risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer who is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather narrow situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could be treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start what was the interruption to a minimum, if that's the right term for such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing on itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inability of victory we went their first thoughts to Williams, who spent a nervenerous morning so he spent a little more than anything else and thereby trying to handle his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning who was as captain of the Royal Artillery regiment in action in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. this is perhaps something extremely, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is repeated only, how much I mean, how much I and Helen and I also worked on.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I would have no better person for coaching or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark have started up, Stanning and Glover had too much to reserve too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to disrip itself away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to make something rabies.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted to have no fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take time for a year before making decisions about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have been too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London, it took about six months to realize that I am a Olympic champion.</seg>

<seg id="11">Member communities are the church of Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunns Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), remembered that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water keeper and was appointed the executive director of the association.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks are very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, the budget plan, calculation of fees and contributions by way to emergency risk," said the chairman.</seg>

<seg id="22">He is the best water keeper and he was a devoted scarce.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together, we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlights from the point of view, he described the Brunnenbau and the restructuring of the association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the most difficult challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the pier at the Kirchlouder at a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of Neubrunn was also only maintained, because you filled the container of Pettstadt with battles.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she took the subject music, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, merrily and overall, says she.</seg>
<seg id="5">In addition to her health and her spirit she is doing something good.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is like a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular cohesion, seniors social contacts can slip and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures occur at the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience also made Ursel Kipp in their choir: "to talk and organise themselves on the other, and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of interaction."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be stressful in the positive sense, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so seniors are practicing deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever asks his lungs regularly, is not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to get the sound of the voice in the age, singing a optimum hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal association of seniors-organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that singing or hearing of songs in older people wakes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, people are depressed to themselves on long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the head is demanding a special achievement, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on his own voice and to focus on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Older people who live alone, exercise so, not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in chorus, Hackler writes.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is growing through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I am long for something I'll get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 sincingly people who hears, when a tone is coming next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In the search for the appropriate offer, seniors are different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone singing the circle in a veteran enchantor, you can just connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior tunes can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who has no access to the Internet, can ask family, friends or neighbours with the help of Internet access.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should have to connect to a choir, Hackler advises.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">On the other hand, the Thai police declared that the attacks are not in connection with Islamic insurgency, or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local Sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said one speaker in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, one expects that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid.</seg>

<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha said that bombs were an attempt to stiff chaos, while the country goes towards stability, an improvement of economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, keeps himself up to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it did not succeed in the military, which has been in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country to get rid of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>

<seg id="8">When this week of some Uzbeers hit a filter which gave them stripes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature of Asians - "jaunting."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repeated controversy has been referred to a larger problem, that the company has diversatility.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat that it had been deactivated.</seg>

<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by detailed findings.</seg>
<seg id="17">Additionally, additional investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that agreed with some of the conclusions of the republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly limited process for the creation of the market assessment of Isil and Iraq's security services," "" "gave the highest ranking Democrat in the Committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a position." ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General-inspect of the Pentagon, which were analyzed by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press preacher of the Pentagon, gave evidence that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports during the investigation of the General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also admitted that "experts at times have underpassed opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the Intelligence and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion on this important issues of the national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question, to what President Obama can leave on Central Command for an honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writing about it, such as the former government under George W.

<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, too late it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro vary consistently and unavoidable, a rapid relay between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is served by the wristwatch for gymnasit to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't listen to the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in Coffeshop, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leopy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well be sent to Prime Time, which would be sent to Prime Time, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade there are the types of sports that are not generally recognised: air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may end it long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make sure arguments for my particular darling, let me turn the attention of the discrete charm of the trampolins.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines already have an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so pointed out that many people knew I didn't know that it was at all a Olympic port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes on competition, it never won a medal in the trampoline and made a athlete that made it to the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians who share the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal in London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jump has some extent of the side, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear to a clownsschule, which sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dead enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonful tremor of his never to end collision - but also the Grazie of the gym and diving, the two types of sports that combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means a lot means as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, pireal and saltos) before they landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty level, and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-three athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes go back and back to the ground up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also another cavity goal: the world or the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted striving is nobel, admired, even fanatic, and it's enough to stir up a spectator.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel when watching these games as a little fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this, the trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline springers is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she stooped down, seemingly hardelos like an astronaut, go up, then downwards, then effortlessly to the top.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant raising of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is like how the competition can only be with the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Qualification and final dogs of the women will take place on Friday in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC gets out the final hand part of an afternoon distance to two days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment that will probably be overseen in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the level of consciousness can only be reached by the Angus and the objections of male athletes - as the male US Turner first proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley awaits its after air ringement, new fanbase.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a Generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long Proally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Protests in Ethiopia in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters that demand political changes in Ethiopia are struggled on violent opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that some criminals were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia right to break?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid community with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the past few months protests against the government the country and farmed themselves in more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot dead and killed police officers.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN Authority for Human Rights demanded an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it's always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, one research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is estimated to be the most populous country in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians in order to fight terrorist attacks on the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was everything as a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was reduced, whereby dissidents were effectively put into silence.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, or pushed into the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have other options apart, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use up to sausages in relation to power of ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a battle for these zacky, controversial line took place in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less, the turbulence could benefit and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now able to explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians were able to communicate through the social media, as cheap smartphones have always been more common and improved the internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, do so many people still communicate via internet proxies to hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since branches prospered, the Amharas, which originate from Ethopia, mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and living in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are involved in coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the fields of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population, which are dominant in the military, in the trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was a former rebel leader until his death in 2012 was 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly embarrassed in it, to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and Special Representative to deal with opponents and to make it harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is missing on this fundamental idea," "" "Mr Abdi said, a conflict analysis." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian, new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen of relatively incomprehensible reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys the trust of the Tigray-controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uprouproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested by the Government, apparently by the government and subsequently stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raid, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of the disturbances sank relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts commence Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commution, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this does not have the intention to prevent internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month the protesters in Gondar, a amharish city, led by Tigray and hatred toward the Tigray is becoming more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests from the US and other Western allies bring into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if they were recently informed that they closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it doesn't want his ally to unite into a volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explained his claim Obama to have ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy carried out by his campaign by sending his repeatedly repeated statement, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "Founder" of the Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification cast new questions on the communication skills of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow comrades who endeavour to take him during an eventful phase in protection to explain in the actual position that he could not mean.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the impression at a voting event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump died in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted he did not intend to signify the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in a early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump, he was simply sarkastical.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a row of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump tried to weaken the statement, reminded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism grabbed Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling down assets to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">He warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clint's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">In late July he moved strong criticism as he meant that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clint Emails, but he later explained "Of course" I said the sarkastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to ruders.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages sent from his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary," "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication experts who observe the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is smart enough to keep his testimony vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of sharpening the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has received an even corrosive tone, since its demand had declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head office in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he accuses his critics frequently to disagree his testimony or to understand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he focuses on the focus of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps snails his loyal contributors to the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provokant his statements may also be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps, was most prominent in the world to defend the candidates in a CNN-interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says, legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani said he was about the correctness of Mr. Trumps comments whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbites, completely false and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government has served under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton used as a foreign minister, ISIS allowed themselves to spread themselves, the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, and cast them up, riding on every one of his words and to be biased with him.</seg>

<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it is also curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafes.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working with Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>

<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg, and visits the verb regularly.</seg>

<seg id="36">In fact, the owner of the Soap Cherie is to prepare a special soap for verb with the cool coffee of the coffee coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we will go to their offer," Rodriguez said.</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional, Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>

<seg id="40">The location also has further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice locally would like to fill the cold washed coffee into the bottles.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café is expanding onto a neighboring building.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">More rarely sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenlandhaie usually come only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the Sanna research site.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haie won't get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely swimming in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it is currently 1.220 metres wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-meter long animal accelerates up to 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed it is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">This form of long-term lifestyle seems to be a patterness for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues have reported in the professional journal "Science" at any time in Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Schünemann says from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic Research in Rostock, this lifespan means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the Evolutionsbiologe) already projected that Greenland's hair is stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's hair is hard to observe, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the shores coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they appear mostly in the winter only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know very little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her monthly pentagia is the same, when they were sampled six animals with a station in front of the valbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the jaw of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice cream and looking for carcasses who are from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haunt, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was only 81 centimeters long, whereas the largest 502-centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lens in sharks with the Carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of eye lens is already developed before the birth of sharks, which contained in the proteins will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when atomic fact trials fell larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast, at 220 centimeters long-smallest animal contained a low surplus of Carbon-14 out of the nuclear weapons, it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the bigger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 quantities, that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the Carbon-14 Clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland at a age of 335 years, during the record-hair with 502 centimeters even 392 years of age should be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Greenland-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange a age at the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters were probably determined on the threshold for sexually mature and its age with 156 years has been determined, Greenland's hair is evident at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live primarily in ferrous waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland, was put in his bacon on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to its low temperatures, the organism of living animals live on sparkflame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and alight slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often particularly big.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal saves heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than at a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on it as far as many offspring as possible," explains the evolution of evolution.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, however, should invest its resources more in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Gravel's name Callum Skinner last night in the championship race sprint in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took a role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to him. the young and made the legend as he stormed to home a victory away from New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took place in March at the London World Championships in London, despite the return of Hoys, only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as an execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap to conclude Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man where they stayed, when they saw potential in the gravel, which opened itself now.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner put in the qualifying round a Olympics, but in the standing hands won the New Zealander in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a big part of the transformation, where Hindes in a higher aisle runner, to slow down and it is Kenny and above all skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell in Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they rose to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I am here to do my best and make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a Olympiad in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he fell down to the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and no objection of England's rivals came.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a victory there was no problem for this time.</seg>

<seg id="24">We joined the team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which have won seven of 10 tracks both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for the British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the käme of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, who starts to start today and will go through three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>

<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be defeated." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the quickest performance in four-four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 on the target.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was contested with proof of the qualification in front of the qualification, when officials called it to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the respective women's competition, the tomorrow continued and ended, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong platform team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a look at medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">It played Dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical conductors Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and mobingles, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first night of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks very soon as the legendary reputation of GBS, which has reached the perfect moment of its climax.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of aluminium meltins from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are standing on the game since the plant operator will terminate the energy supply and thereby raise all delivery contracts, as the energy company delivered.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A maximinum payout is scheduled for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are standing in the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could occur to dominance effects, as the melting temperature is consumed by approximately 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa completed the Point of Henry, leading to a closure of the Anglesea force of power last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risked a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of publishing on the future of the complex, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and last due to the electricity price for the facility.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminum meltorial with his Loy Yang A Power plant in Latine Valley, told that there are three other owners to announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is situated in a majority ownership of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL" assumes that the plant is still operated in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt "divided the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to keep the contracts called" "" "hedging transactions" "" "that would have come into force from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice until they end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "hence AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue," "" "said the supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the revenue of AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong points for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL parted that it has already written the value of contracts already in its annual abuses of $187 million in "anticipation of termination".</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book contracts, the "ability of liquor... smack the melting or to ensure the power supply to melting" do not affect.</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that there have been a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who would have had to come into effect from November this year, even if it is a explanation, why it is resigned by the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analyst warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry in front of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume about 900 megawatts each year and around 900 megawatts.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successor today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and larger, it was therefore not good in his hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty big.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes, that would be rich today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone will now be delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euro lovers can buy the devices at the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hanover, Germany, as "office in the Western-bottle format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent for a lot: SMS and e-mails sent and received, even by fax, the Communicator was to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to websites was possible via HTML-browser when also agonising slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital addressbook and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be looked similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, which is about 1400 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police evokes witnesses after spending a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 area close to Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman in Dunklen found himself in an act of despair "on the road and were hit by several cars, the police declared in Waadt.</seg>

<seg id="9">It was opened an investigation procedure, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared the Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was an interference avoidable?</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was once inhabited according to the projections of a new NASA climate model once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms, similar to those of climatic research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have been hereditary conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously stated that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, similar atmosphere, and slowly turned away slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet thought to be more dry areas than the earth, but had once enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow revolution of Venus reaches its daily side of the sun almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio declared in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which affects the surface of a large part of the sun heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are a few degrees of cooler than Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought a history of Venus, which resembles evolution, previously suspected of planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was likely to be inhabitable, the Venus -- in the course of several billion years, was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans digested and their water vapor was burned down by the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When you abandoned hydrogen only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today today.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a current survey of the malware anti-defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once in the past twelve months, partially with multiple victims of an extortion software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the firms already had a target of a ransomyware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to willingly prepare the solvents required to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize the extortion software according to the observations of malwarebytes in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they succeed there, the potential solution is considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the pollutant software," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>

<seg id="11">Only private nutzer were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary quickly in the past months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer's computer, it is looking for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>

<seg id="16">But where with private users the personal photo-database is available on the game, there is a sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls off when a ransomite strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent, even the business activity had to break completely, in case there were people in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals victims, whose patients can be threatened by loss of patient.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "Do not pay, you promote only the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>

<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure investigators have examined the user surface and contact the compressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims per chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, free online support sites, or decrypt for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And they are delivered to payments of a few hundred euros, companies must act as hard, and pay five digit sums to get their data unturnable.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively ristitious gains out of the rankings, the hackers always get professional and share the work, explains security experts Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomyware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Likely it is, however, that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software building castings to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware Kits were created by the malware itself, advising and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a customization tool which can be changed to smaller configurations, appearance, and branding," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then look for further hackers to spread the newly bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the underground, buy the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on the possible many PCs.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inadequately calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals refer to the spread of" "" "explains Wisniewski" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that provide their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT users in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be able to resist using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of the data is no sufficient threat to successful awakening, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the compensation potential, depending on the type of data, a multiple higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">We could also make the perpetrators completely new goals in the Internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers, as they were able to get one with the connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the free folding of such blocked heating may well be a ransom value.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and everyday dust</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, has actually proved very flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it works closely.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well processed and feel comfortable, only the cockpit top falls out there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is not only a trunk-trunk of 453 l, and 1026 l is available at rectangled back-proof, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat areas of the backrest can be open up like cinema armchairs and therefore offer storage space, which is high from floor up to 1,24 m high.</seg>
<seg id="10">The boot room can be well-loaded, however, the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to a torque value of up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is likely to have a little more quiet, however.</seg>
<seg id="13">The everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering is likely to be more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top variant "Executive" cannot be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among the safety systems the City-Notbremsassistant (works up to speed 32), the collision alarm system and the spine assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision swarms are sometimes irritated, because he rated many obstacles as "heranness objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">Very reliable works of the district assistant.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temper controller is responding to the traffic sign detection and impose the speed if needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, Navi, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI-jack are below the armrest and are therefore something awkward.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top-diesel engines are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline at 20,000 euros, the diesel off 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday suitability car.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks eternally around, at night you wake up in the morning, just before the wake-up claps no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, you have problems with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than 10 percent, their sleep often finds its sleep frequently or not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and many causes are underlying, emphasises Hans-Günter Weep, Member of the Board of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schlafflement und Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand is, however, is never the Insomnia, meaning a single and a sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just going through, many people feel as an unfreeze or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the member of the German Hauser Association with Practice in Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Organic, psychic or behaviours are able to use drugs, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake up is common for depression often," "" "said Weep." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and starts to salvably, about everyday problems and worry, there is no example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should we use sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a month of at least three nights per week, should not sleep well and a day should go to the doctor, advises weaving.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look completely different: one is smitten, tired, unfinished, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical ailments like stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to figure out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioral therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional case and at most for two weeks - inquery.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, he hardly emphasizes in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fiber, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should first apply at sleeping difficulties, advises weaving.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can clarify with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be at sleep laboratory, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For investigation in a sleep laboratory medical device, for example, in snoring with respiratory viability, at sleep allowance, or if you cannot find the cause of a sleeping disorder is not explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't need to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"don't make a lunch sleep", "Fiber says.</seg>
<seg id="30">After turning down, one goes to his normal time into bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nobloggles, a chest strap, and a Fühler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera shows the ceiling on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How do people able to handle the handle in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many screws, where you can get for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">White is on: regular sleeping and rise, not too long in bed, don't sleep in bed, don't watch television to sleep, avoid drinking alcohol, and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's quite and absolutely not.</seg>

<seg id="5">In recent weeks, article about this fashionable "trendy" housing estate is called Friedrichshain, but will be illustrated by burning cars in the last weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the inhabitants of rent contracts, on the ground floor are occupied still spaces and are used for events.</seg>

<seg id="8">On 22 June the premises on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared out, patrol the police three weeks later, with 30 to 40 civil servants and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated construction workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin-administrative court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved under the cheers of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves ahead of late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In immediate proximity of the hood projects there are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the "" "" Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the "" "" Kiez "" "" since 1999, especially from the police presence. "" "</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the hood, they share the care of increasing rents and magically.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a "Kiez, who wanted to pick up mostly police protection from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, that of the Berlin Innensenator and the police make up their neighbours, obviously doesn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working area, which is also evident in comparison to the rest of the city a humiliation and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Buildings and newborn residential projects are already part of the "Kiez:" in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former German Democratic Republic, including almost the whole Mainzer street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been cleared among large police officers in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and partly still inhabited by people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnets for tourists and ballers from around the world: with them the inhabitants of GDR times and former household heretics are sharing their "Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">This also makes itself noticeable for the owners who have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in designed slices or freshly painted facades, which have been thrown off with colours.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">A reason that not all neighbours can see it as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injurious statistics, according to policing statistics, is almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the crimes are making property damages, the tencially more remodelings and newly renovated homes.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, uncertainty may not be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours that were certainly not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars make it right in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the architect of architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, live together on the street and gets more each other than woundated." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately moved into the Rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore, it was so important that the natives return their streets: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to be taken away: due to unimaginable newbuildings in former buildings, that push the old inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee camp for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the management of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It looks as the contact partner for all actors: refugees, working, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else are still missing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteer work is more than thankful that Deuverle is now there, the eager Wollumigau, that has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocked on the multitude of responsibilities - targeted - meant as the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, an enviable rug style.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Especially it is about organization, working with the people on the spot, and behind the scenes as well as power stations.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Client that Annika Deuverle Ehren- and main actors supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human, and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in Wasenstraße soon stand</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem, it has been recognized for some time to find apartments for connecting-fleeing that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Communes are responsible for connecting frames.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must undertake the refugees in their own or rented residential homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations need to carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Countryside office in the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer its apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search is designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work until now, if you rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, generously need to be reviled, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are installed in Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, regine client and Annika Deuschle agrees.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are internships, training courses, school grounds, one-euro jobs and helpless activities for refugees and migrants who have to be folded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that's motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes the work of joint action leads to a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">Activity, however, does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuverle and Customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a remedy.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you jump here to administration and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It was central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You must explain the refugees that it takes, and it will be able to complete the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who sometimes evolve the feeling he could not work in Urbach nobody, don't work and be unprofitable, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority are motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, the customer says, "People, in which nothing goes." the work by Deuschle and Customer are therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this was already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two are afraid of radicalization, even in a small municipality like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine says clearly," "" "what mancher naive may call." "" "a residue course could and would not exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents have been subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the assassin, they bring them completely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So major and volunteer volunteer do have to look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they have always been in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This question clearly is to answer, the policy is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we are not here, where we would like," "" "said Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Client makes also clear that the Urbacher has also been utilized to integrate the existing human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 persons, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there is no easy answers.</seg>
