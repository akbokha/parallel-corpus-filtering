Obama welcomes Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just really friendly .
the two wished to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and beyond Teheran to talk dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the encounter also said about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ states alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been o@@ stra@@ ined for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Netanyahu &apos;s failure to resolve the peace process .
through the deal by Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March Netanyahu was held an cont@@ enti@@ ous speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , partly as an aff@@ ron@@ ed against Obama .
the speech was not dis@@ soci@@ ated with Obama , a meeting was denied with a reference to the forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor , his friend shot to have shot ,
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb told him a little strange voice in the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
lamb had been important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s and a handwritten note that was on a white block . I &apos;m sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication of that lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he had been killed and killed at the door to his office at the door of his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all the local people heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that lamb had made the cat@@ astrop@@ hic quotes after that point .
by the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb opened life as the police forces him .
one day after shooting in the university , students and lecturer , hiding behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of it , which is motivated by lamb .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state published details , as well as what students and employees did know him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teachers .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s died , said he did not have any history of violence or criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself , however , mentioned in a written book in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he divided his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both sub@@ missions in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations concerning proble@@ matic behaviour patterns .
a student , bran@@ ded Be@@ avers , who gave to Lamb , said , He seemed to be a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
a different student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to ask a beats for health reasons and said that he had any problem with any health problem .
he only taught two online courses this year .
most recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy said that the promotion , for which lamb had worked so hard for him , would be no warranty for an automatic journey to be Assistant Professor Assistant Professor .
all university president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between lamb and Schmidt but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions that are no longer answer to Lamb .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs once again when he returned to Mississippi from Arkan@@ sas .
before he could be arrested , lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said she thinks he knew people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students living in a city with around 12,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ographie and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did his doctorate in the ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends lam@@ ed him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb had 20 , when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar game .
at that time , he was the women of women .
all the girls who were there when he was there , &quot; said hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were obviously a few times together .
in the emergency call &apos; I said &apos; I have killed my wife , but there was no certificate of a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that ren@@ ders a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ ren@@ tic@@ es , Shawn O &apos; Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&apos;@@ It was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
Oh &apos; Ste@@ en said he has never met along but because of his daughter Abig@@ ail he heard that she was interested in music and playing blues .
lamb met P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , when he and Abig@@ ail came three years ago , both in a summer @-@ year @-@ old market .
later they played together with the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had left lamb and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s Night in the night of 5 September for the last time since lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a fun audience .
there was no signs that something would not agree .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were clean and jo@@ king together .
I mean they had both a good sense for j@@ ester .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English teacher at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday night including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ light memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the Memorial guard , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the classes is resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ geli@@ o So@@ lis reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police have said that lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt in his emergency calls , but there is no indication of that the two had ever been married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; by Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat at the theater at the Roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty beside me , and it will gradually add that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me that I am a sim@@ ulated variation and an arm length of it , with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentation about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s true for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ str@@ ut@@ ably the greatest time travel movie that has ever been filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October .
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
ban Ki @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN leader calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and support integ@@ rative negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban on Wednesday announced a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the foreign minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain , and France - on the si@@ delines of the meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria .
he regre@@ ts that the rebels in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Pow@@ ers &quot; make this situation un@@ solv@@ able . &quot;
ban asked for five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , in violation of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 conversion values show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to hit him as a flop .
others have taken it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
however , no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper sections in p@@ olls , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate carrier .
naturally it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was handed over to the rising Herman Cain , and none of them won just a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have been fighting in a general election .
but outside troops like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise tr@@ um@@ ps and start to run down their dollar to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current fre@@ igh@@ ters which suggest that the real estate database Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary stage :
the popularity rating have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ di@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l .
it was 40 percent in mid @-@ July .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten saying that they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa found that 60 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
just two out of 10 say they would be &quot; angry &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same excitement as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent , which tell the same over tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ cont@@ ented &quot; or &quot; would be &quot; dis@@ cont@@ ented , &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans can not look as a problem .
whereas Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive comments , 52 percent of the two rep@@ u@@ ating voters think that the real estate has had the right temperature for a President , according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first executive state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively manage its office , and say nearly six out of 10 claims that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when putting their money @-@ away , republi@@ can voters keep a definition for real terms .
if they are asked who will win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump was the best bet .
this is a change since then , when four out of ten finished their money in J@@ eb Bush .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not had the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans took that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination towards just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nonetheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will see a plau@@ sible campaign as plau@@ sible campaign .
even if rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered some other candidates , Tr@@ ump kills almost everyone .
some experts refer to that the fra@@ yed field probably contributes to the tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ b@@ ump support is divided on more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ use .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between b@@ ump and the majority of other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is a majority support .
he wrote 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ det and Chris Christie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate to strike him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head .
a scar@@ city of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says they made their opinion .
a new survey carried out by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters that support Tr@@ ump to say they have received their voices .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion .
46 percent said they had opened the door open to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the Neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters that have formed their opinion , are twice as frequently for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree to the immigration of Immig@@ ration .
ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico had &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; emerged , the immigration and the fishing spot was in public dis@@ course at the public dis@@ course in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic increase of tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ p@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and damage the new@@ building efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the immigration of Immig@@ ration .
so long as the migration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump appears to do also .
the fru@@ strations over the government clim@@ bs to new levels .
by now on Donald St@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the assistance of Republican voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they would rather have a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa for two weeks shows that three of four I@@ owa @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent dis@@ satisfied , &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive residential community with views of the North Sea Region .
in the street , a square foot area of a furnished house is 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is still limited , i.e. it &apos;s in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers a square metre costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euro per square meter for a student body in Munich are not really low .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top @-@ scale areas , however , the price depends on the scale of Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate providers Angel &amp; V@@ ölk@@ l published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square scales in dizz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros not - per square meter , mind you .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here as an exception , not at the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ times Tor@@ r@@ ze in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
another hit by Thomas Müller before FC Bayern paved the way for a well earned 3 : 0 by the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then she ran .
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze was entitled to a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the witch ha@@ iler of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympics in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ z &apos;s hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th success in the series will be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third country .
Müller was received in the Champions League at the Champions League on the Bavaria @-@ tour guide of the alleg@@ ations of Olympic @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who could pass a f@@ lange back to the World Championship .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; had Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame before the game played in Kar@@ a@@ is@@ k@@ ak@@ is @-@ Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot fans - and the Munich gained word .
they showed a concentrated , dedicated idea , not to shine .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the Royal Class , including Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund was also proud to date ( 1 : 3 ) .
however , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek Teams they did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , with their evident efforts but often in@@ ventive .
the attacks were often directed to Lin@@ ks@@ outside Douglas Costa , which was rarely progres@@ sed against the earlier Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made more happiness from the right , when his flan@@ k collapsed in the left @-@ left corner of the left gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best fort@@ night in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
initially , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker ide@@ ye Brown struck the head@@ ball of the Pol@@ es on the line ( 26th ) .
then , by direct withdrawal , the al@@ keeper has been par@@ ted with the knee with his knee . ( 35 . ) .
although the Bavaria is und@@ ated to have lived domin@@ ican game , Pi@@ raeus was able to put sof@@ as .
but Manuel New was at the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel New .
for example , when he de@@ vised a shot of ideas about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
new before New settled Gu@@ ardi@@ ola to defend a qu@@ ette with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back after muscular problems at the cad@@ res , was sitting outside first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cup @-@ Held did not give the green light after finishing his final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sporting presentation Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different that is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the initial change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the requested Lev@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller became a better .
before the game , it was up to us in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly rep@@ ented Bayern fans in their audience and apparently prov@@ oked the followers of Pi@@ raeus , with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went with ra@@ vines against the Munich tra@@ ilers .
a minimum of Bavaria @-@ fans were injured from the stadium .
those smo@@ kes , has higher risk of losing teeth
those smo@@ kes , do not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - which suggests a Pots@@ dam@@ er @-@ term study close .
good news : when ren@@ unci@@ ation decreases the risk of risk .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing its teeth early .
this focuses on the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smoking smoking the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely at 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ache was higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes for tooth @-@ loss results c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ ing@@ i@@ val , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and denti@@ sts therefore go back to frequent gum disease in smokers .
not clari@@ fied , however , smoking increases the risk of cavi@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who listened to smoking can reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could however last over ten years until the endanger@@ ing was sin@@ king back to the level of non @-@ smoking , first @-@ author Thomas Dietrich from the English University Birmingham .
they let people convince themselves to be non @-@ smoking , student director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking breaks the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our findings also to a good dental health until the high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of people aged 65 to 74 years of dent@@ ure , DI@@ f@@ E shared with them .
earlier studies were already noted that smoking affects the risk of early age out@@ age .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ ples the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer to Rest@@ ore from the late antique jewellery
once again , on the right of Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne , archaeological finds have been made .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archaeological divers discovered a skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , museum manager Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
the Museum is always considered to be a specialist in the archaeological area of Cologne in the district of Cologne .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards the ar@@ che@@ ologists were found to find .
from text documents , it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained in Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and steep@@ le , a cemetery with some 350 graves were also discovered that belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TT@@ IP new court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private light facilities for disp@@ utes between businesses and states are intended to be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to much more traditional dishes in its functionality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained by the Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to introducing a European negoti@@ ating meeting , the Swe@@ de has set up a European negoti@@ ating meeting with the United States .
the German Government announced support .
the world &apos;s largest trade zone with 800 million people will be created by TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proce@@ eding suggest@@ ing that the EU states and the US choose independent judges for a new investment climate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should come from the EU , the US and third @-@ party countries .
the first instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to rise against ur@@ gency .
so far , the process of operations resulted in a refer@@ ee , a possibility of imp@@ ossi@@ bility to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she plans to work on an international investment tribunal .
there , for example , a disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clari@@ fied .
especially of major corporations , the Investor @-@ Ar@@ bit@@ ration @-@ Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ers are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary on the organization of compensation for tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ ell accepted the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was primarily critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economy minister Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great progress .
considering the reform , the Commission will take into account significant points , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old Ar@@ bit@@ ration system is from the table .

delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
in addition to it is an fli@@ pchart , on which the shy of acting followers , Michigan have recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost the case of Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he rel@@ ates with various places he always shows on the map , wor@@ rying about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they were born and , as it looks , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens has been a wonderful creative mis@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear smart @-@ composed songs , which can be very close to American folk music in the late six@@ ties , but could be perfectly gro@@ oved at any time .
the rum@@ our arises that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a solid series : each of the 50 U.S. states must be consul@@ ted in a row .
but in 2004 and in the middle of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and gave rise to positively .
and Stev@@ ens can be reduced here .
live guitars and ban@@ jo is enough for him .
one year later , the musician returned to New York living musicians back to the show .
&quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The New oise &quot; ) in 2005 appeared in a nationwide master@@ piece in 2005 .
over@@ taking ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and no one @-@ year chart of the influential music media is missing .
after reproductive experim@@ entation , Stev@@ ens then re@@ handles on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) , extensive , extensive , temp@@ tations .
this sixth month studio album is still wide orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences , or beats , and plays with all kinds of effect and hall .
long ago the smaller club shows , the stage shows here on the colourful spectacle of Ne@@ on @-@ Stir@@ n@@ b@@ sen and the Great fluorescent stage of Büh@@ nen .
at the moment Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band of Germany .
in the dark@@ ened ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
Theater proudly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; which has been available since March .
although almost 2000 guests were banned in their chairs , the Stev@@ ens is returning back to in@@ timacy and folk .
without creating a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians play through the wide enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the lecture was &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; plate in essence . &quot;
as a addition to Stev@@ ens Stev@@ ens , Stev@@ ens plays more acou@@ sti@@ cally , plays more acou@@ sti@@ cally and finally , with tos@@ sed applause .
Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ en has now expected to anticip@@ ate tension in the prime minister of the prime minister of the prime minister .
the new president , Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , will give his debut in the parliamentary group of Prime Minister and join with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is now up@@ lifting for the first of its six given questions just to noon , whereby its performance from the media probably and the Labour MPs will probably be insp@@ ected by the area .
he called &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p a few sessions to leave their colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , for she comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ endant and his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour chairman &apos;s decision was prov@@ oked on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the core of several cover @-@ pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ a &apos;s decision to sing not the national hy@@ mn , has attracted attention to itself
a spokes@@ man provided by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had had &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the British chairman he advised the National An@@ them to sing &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ als to the differences between the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be st@@ acked within Labour , &quot; following Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on position to the European Union and the limit of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour amend@@ ments to remove all the idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and R@@ unning ministers , said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the leader of the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss during the last decade , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament .
the chairman , who has promised another policy of politics , says he said &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and had given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is to con@@ front the prime minister , and that he is under@@ taking both &quot; schl@@ ero@@ sion &quot; and the battle with resistance , and instead had to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic Minister , will represent it if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into the conversation with other colleagues to take the word and that he had addressed John Ber@@ s@@ cow , the White House spokes@@ man to discuss the problem .
when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to remove himself from the politics of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters . &quot; but a few years later he admitted that he had failed .
as she was sent in television first in 1990 , the question was considered to be the main bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the Unter@@ haus and his position under his parliamentary seat , although critics have argued that it has become a cartoon and require further reforms .

accelerated pay growth in the United Kingdom
the pound increased dramatically to data , which indicate a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the SA@@ BM@@ iller network .
between May and July , the income increased by 2.9 % in the United Kingdom compared to the same period of the same period .
this percentage had been the quick@@ est and up@@ set ass@@ essments above the time of interest increased .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar on $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump from 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .

Bur@@ berry shares were much higher after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury goods ri@@ chemicals ( 0.9 % higher ) .
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - returns to growth again .

the manager of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more &quot; buying power in the po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchase will be the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

p@@ calcul@@ ator - calcul@@ ating Lebanese with potato @-@ ön@@ er @-@ idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in potato @-@ ön@@ er , developed by Han@@ i Al@@ hay , the Ol@@ denburg I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; on a poster of the level movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the idea , a poster presented him at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen in television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
this idea has meanwhile been awarded the Lebanese man to en@@ act in Munich .
according to the authority , the authority has been protected as a utility company since recently .
how much meat and how much potatoes the spro@@ ut contains , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
just as much : &quot; it tastes even better &quot; together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding will also be held at its customers .
Met@@ cash starts Land Dis@@ miss@@ al campaign against com@@ b@@ ating Al@@ di@@ - inv@@ ents
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the IG@@ A locations in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ allic has started a recycling campaign to defend the market share of the IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia in advance a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and manufacture IG@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing concerning social media , as well as events such as Adelaide show .
IG@@ A dealer and supplier start aboard , with brands such as Eis@@ maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ shops , and shop@@ keeper who sell used tickets for the South Australian soccer league to faithful customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash out@@ lines further details of his defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesale tra@@ ders for food , alcohol and devices carried out their annual Invest@@ ors &apos; day off .
it is much at stake where South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A store , and higher profit mar@@ gins generate a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial , and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much more significant market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to approximately 14 percent in eastern Australia countries .
but analysts as Morgan Stanley believed that Al@@ di will s@@ lap twelve percent of the food market in these two states after opening his first markets and take away all the present , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley ass@@ essing that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 million sales per year and $ cash for $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opened the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and grocery store and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed base could cost $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ ering gains market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ l of Roy Morgan found that IG@@ A @-@ buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stanley is assi@@ sting Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told her business in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably be able to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member has contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , food and food retailers that have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the operating debt reduction in similar pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers never ins@@ ist and invested more than 150 million dollars in order to equal sales prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve their stores due to fast growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private @-@ label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s flagship business leader Ian Mor@@ rice states that the price adap@@ tations and loading machinery to Elan are expected , and hopes that the wholesale dealers will return in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ ks@@ Ko@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ ks@@ Ko@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves better praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ ks@@ Ko@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; collabor@@ ative damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves the opinion of the President &apos;s President Steve He@@ aly rather praise to his own behavior .
co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is still called &quot; Special KS &quot; , continues through the not@@ orious engagement for Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinnati soon afterwards co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , Harrison &apos;s called W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat the baby . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket when a Kra@@ mp@@ f was hiding a potential US Open victory by Richard Gaz@@ quet , Ko@@ aly def@@ ends himself in He@@ aly def@@ aul@@ ts .
the teen@@ ager is at Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in single and Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against United Kingdom .
&quot; a thing about which I became very jeal@@ ous , is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was a little bit drawn into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost an opponent into the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of them .
but , really , he has proved extremely well in the US Open , even amongst the pretty prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strictly concern .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes into the team and so on , he is still working hard , he &apos;s a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deser@@ ved it to be judged for his own services .
He@@ aly also supported the decision , Kyr@@ gios when the key decision was not to take into consideration , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common choice &quot; as the right for all , but he guarantees to return to the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long term permanent feature into the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversy &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think Nick has made the as@@ cen@@ sion to what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he gets in the eyes of the public , and he &apos;ll try to make it clear , and we try to think of him the consequences of his action . some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I hold for reasonable , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
European refugee crisis : Hungary declared state of Hungary , closing the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the state border and secured the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firmly that tried to come into the country illeg@@ ally . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
at the border , chaos followed , as hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indig@@ nation .
the people who had fled before violence were found for an unknown period in a country strip on the road between the two controls of the countries , and built tents down there .
but fru@@ strations grew up .
when a police helicopter was floating over them , the migrants &apos; mou@@ sec@@ oned the border . &quot; and they cried to protest against the Hungarian anti @-@ election police .
some pointed out of protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said that it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants were sent from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral action .
in the coming days of interviews with Brussels and other countries , Iv@@ ica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement should be achieved that the EU states will take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special conference on the European Union to discuss the immigration reform of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not bet its hopes on an al@@ lied action of Brussels or its neighbours .
the emergency department published on Tuesday in two southern regions suffered greater powers to enable the crisis so that they could accelerate roads and asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country is also planning a st@@ inger wi@@ z@@ a@@ us along its border to Romania in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary is responsible for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the N@@ ear East and an enormous bott@@ len@@ eck for the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and no war @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the cross of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us , to build the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also act higher pun@@ ishments for the traff@@ ick@@ ness of traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government advoc@@ ates Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs Rep@@ or@@ ers in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have had heavily armed troops on the border with vehicles and dogs on day@@ el@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people when attemp@@ ting to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come across by damage the fence , they are now in custody and are accused of off@@ ences against the new laws .
authorities are involved to rep@@ airing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials included two of the seven border crossing operations with Serbia , after a draw @-@ car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos transformed the most important Gren@@ zen@@ ge close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to deal with the data of people and pressed a crowd around there .
around 20 succeeded in getting involved , but thousands of stayed outside .
another group of migrants who blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would like food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
the U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains their opposition to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the vote in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders stands second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed , is a member of the presidential election , receives support from 15 percent of the voters of the voters .
more than five months before the beginning of the pre @-@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are volatile than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders gains some gains .
Clinton holds a big advantage of women and mix@@ tures , but this fe@@ eb@@ le has reduced .
their support for men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is down here with 5 points .
so Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage with democratic voters behind the age of 50 has failed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
however , Clinton had a big advantage over older voters .
last month , Clinton flew with the double @-@ digit advantage over the Liber@@ als but S@@ anders got a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the voters of democratic voters say that it would support Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support them with some privileg@@ es and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are bl@@ ended with those who do not support Clinton - just about one quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of voters say that Clinton would like to support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ ics supporters are asked in an open question , why they want you to be the correct answer is that she has the correct answer ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
the agreement for dealing with the problems and voters are also quoted .
as the vice president acc@@ uses a potential for the presidency in the balance sheet , 57 percent of voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it .
if elections are asked for election , those who for the party would have their second choice is Bi@@ den at the top .
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half that bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den do not decide to get the nom@@ ination of demo@@ cr@@ ats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters are thought to represent the best chance of winning the election ; however , this number has fallen by 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far the second with this measurement , but the percentage being on the &quot; chosen &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , by the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call for the elec@@ tr@@ ability .
similarly as in the last month , no one single democra@@ t candidate or potential candidate for the voters of the presidential elections are not acceptable .
the Democratic Can@@ did@@ ates or potential candidates give good results in some important features of voters for the party &apos;s pre@@ elections .
look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and powerful with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts the lead in the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons starch is the lead .
thirty @-@ percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton &apos;s honest and trusted , twice as many say that by S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him .
elections in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all of these measurements , about one @-@ four@@ ths of democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal E @-@ mail address and server will continue to be continued as foreign minister during the term as external minister , most of the political voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not affected altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public .
the half of the Americans is now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only one @-@ third is satisfied .
the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most of the Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy did not have any impact on their general opinions from Clinton , though 36 percent said that their opinion did not deterior@@ ate .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters have also seen p@@ umping as non @-@ honest and un@@ trusted .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good grades with guidance .
out of the six clever candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best out of hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as in Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters at the local elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving to a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump on
Ben Car@@ son is located on the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters reti@@ res in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republican voters are still supporting dr@@ unk@@ ers in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month to perform 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son meets demo@@ graphic in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passes Republican voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Ka@@ det , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins &apos;s Governor Scott Walker , who is the lowest of 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida governor , J@@ eb Bush , the former Governor of Arkan@@ sas . Mike Hu@@ ck@@ enh@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are on third place .
the error mar@@ ge at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republican voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , released last week , shows that Car@@ son wins in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed p@@ umping over Car@@ son .
with a view to one of the rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some page positions for the former neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the tr@@ um@@ ps faith in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday last Saturday during an initial appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant beach temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean Sea is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if the peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough to prevent hot water .
a bath in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
maneu@@ ver is no longer going to the sea : maximum 18 degrees the water in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) divi@@ des .
pool temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it even stands up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is located at the top of 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .

five members of the Brotherhood ro@@ ared with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ com@@ ings
two years after a student in the wild ritual of a student joint in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , M@@ ord@@ an@@ compl@@ ains were handed over five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood adopted Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed its transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he was bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack of sand , and repeatedly has been attacked , while he tried to turn over a frozen field .
Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained of head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was rewarded and waited for an hour before it brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change their clothes , to change his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , to call the national President of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said Poli@@ tic@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide and sought the good of the Brotherhood , according to Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after a aut@@ op@@ si@@ fication report , Den@@ g repe@@ ats with mu@@ te force of injuries on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; for many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the Sch@@ ic@@ ans since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
brood @-@ member@@ ships and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
County Grand Jury of Monroe County received a charges of murder for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with different attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; we do not only want to do the participating persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this sanc@@ tioned , we will also act these as account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College was banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood re@@ loc@@ alized its belonging to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed has increased its interest
a rate of interest comes , and the car@@ et@@ ess fall into Wan@@ ken &apos;s fall , ren@@ aming for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long it will take , and how long it will pause .
in particular , the story offers for the economy only a small guide to the exp@@ iry date .
a recession produced within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when taking interest rates is often not always , a factor is acting like the economy and financial investments .
hence , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have strongly empha@@ sized that investors should not focus on it whenever they begin to increase interest rates , but rather in the period that is required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables are playing a role .
however , in the end , market participants might find that the entire f@@ uss was potentially exagger@@ ated .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; says Julian J@@ ess@@ op , CEO economist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers .
in contrast , we will not expect the successive return of US interests to normal heights , but still on a low level to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might respond :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate things can be volatile for a while .
once the increase applies , the influence is not so dramatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems to be a tendency to increase total assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German bank analysts in a newer study what happened after interest rate cuts through the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate , somewhat flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit from 14.@@ 4 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average returns to Bob D@@ oll , boss plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s asset management .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares must occur later in times of times , and the return is starting to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases them often .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not existed before and could accelerate the recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at a rate of interest in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate hike had twice stood twice since 1950 twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
even though the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , we expect only a few that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed segment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these interest rate increases with so frag@@ ile economic cul@@ ts could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this time different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken the whole year to an interest rate against the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC is an increase in this meeting , Fut@@ ures trading will only increase the probability of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study , all pre @-@ cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a Super @-@ cycle with increasing moment@@ um with increasing moment@@ um and pre @-@ recession seemed very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report .
in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months so far .
the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market takes a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds the yields appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase in decrease in cycle .
at the end of the high @-@ cycle , the bond accounts immediately dropped , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab think that the rise in the rates of interest will result in the margin between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a decrease in the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds often produce better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st in Schw@@ ab said in an analysis .
Jones comments that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the drop of inflation , there are several signs that the market has adapted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending relax and the vol@@ atility became higher - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensi@@ fies its strategy .
in large and whole , companies that un@@ wrap the larger part of their business activities in the USA will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts become worse , as an increase in dollars will sell their products to the global market , and also financing its debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares incl@@ ined very positively to react three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sachs analysts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported in a report for the clients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheets have reached an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate hike in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low vol@@ atility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality , by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will have a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most likely , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
in the pure stock exchange consumers , consumers will also benefit from increasing revenues .
spar@@ er could see gains due to higher yields , even though experts are different , how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ atives of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster because of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argued that he is not to distinguish increasingly from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also quoted at BBC Music Awards and said she was only The Br@@ its im@@ i@@ ated
European Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins picked the The Voice Command and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts itself to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary committee and puts new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that does not do the private broad@@ caster .
the con@@ doms of Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender has ev@@ apor@@ ated &quot; and increasingly seems to distinguish from its competitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dar@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also raised the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to show The Br@@ its just under another name .
so , if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spont@@ aneously called examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director showed the alleg@@ ations and argue that the BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to public music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will have to learn more about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music playing really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to find the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works in order , that &apos;s really matters for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , the BBC Radio 3 Controller attracted Alan Dav@@ ey that he needed to engage in the audience when it did so in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , came under fire to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on your feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins grip The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as the judge - &quot; was produced in a special BBC manner . &quot;
he added , he wishes to find that the company has &quot; a hit from our own man@@ ners &quot; when the next time it was a enter@@ t@@ ein@@ ment show .
however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from The Voice in the future , or to add cash of t@@ ens@@ ors for other entertainment formats .
net sales grew on the slow@@ est in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of cell@@ phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed spending .
for more than a decade the virtual shopping geb@@ o@@ om@@ t , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned themselves in ghost cities .
however , experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts say there are indications that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new numbers shown just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index in the Guardian .
he declared that online sales were strengthened three years ago , when its buyer began to make purchases with their cell@@ phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes a thing , and we may experience that growth will decrease .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the down@@ fall sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases at this event , which will take place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers had to move around their computers in order to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers would fall off .
experts believe that Black Friday will hold a buyer with the buyers to hold fast buyers to buyers .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that , from £ 5 , spending slightly more than 1 £ online was issued .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases has now been performed via web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner city cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family becomes sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in Mec@@ ca by the first bur@@ ial of Muslims
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse in part of the huge Saudi @-@ Bin Laden Group .
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed .
hundreds of Muslims were gathered as 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury the killing depos@@ ited when a crane collapsed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ z@@ ee .
trau@@ matic set , largely in white , dressed in the distance to declare their respect , when the first of the dead came to the Al @-@ Cre@@ te cemetery .
the mour@@ proc@@ ession was passing by the S@@ aints , where only days ago a building crane collapsed through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the bed r@@ ushed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King took over the building company Bin Laden because of the catastrophe which caused 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion was imposed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 patients who were killed when a crane collapsed by the large central mo@@ z@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collapsed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual h@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the h@@ add@@ ling in Mec@@ ca and thousands who continue to arrive to the city will continue .
today King Sal@@ man said the Bin Laden group would not have known the man &apos;s arm when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse .
the english speaking service of the news agency had not reported this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership should be forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised Sal@@ man to reveal what the fall of the crane collapsed , which fell into a courtyard of the grand@@ mo@@ z@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims drew from the h@@ add@@ ling that later in this month were gathered .
the bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the Coll@@ ine &apos;s collapse , and their representatives were not available to a position .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also included the group because of not current security measures and because they had co @-@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project , conducted by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the de@@ fam@@ ed leader of al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a back@@ sliding son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came in am@@ id@@ st strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of each healthy food .
civil servants said 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials announced that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the families of the killed and the same sum has been permanently wounded .
the other last received half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British employ more and more ar@@ tis@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified professionals from eastern Europe rise in an increase
this will lead to the fact that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which are directed at craftsmen , will be opened
King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q Sales Exhibition will also close
from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail
it is alleged that British will present their h@@ amm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favour of the use of qualified East European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out their work in their home
if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to handle walls , you may seem to become a minority nowadays .
for British people are increasingly involved to perform DIY jobs in their homes , such as the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tre@@ et@@ era chain , said that a large rise in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men in Eastern Europe that offer services for low prices is now ob@@ sol@@ ete .
hence King@@ fis@@ her , 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops is planning to open up at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten buying decisions are met by women .
at the moment , men weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to represent the growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households , which have more renovation than in the past .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger into an equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um .
basically , half of our clients consists of 80 percent of the decision on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a large role in decision making .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women who is listed in the fore@@ front of a UK in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also converted her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that holds exactly 50 percent of the team with women including the management and financial officer .
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group backed the costs of money .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
I / DO@@ B officials to use the case for un@@ faith@@ fulness
at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player a@@ ich / DO@@ B have to be responsible for un@@ faith@@ fulness and ev@@ asion .
the def@@ endants are not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was acquitted on this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , he was cryst@@ alli@@ zed out that the accused were deployed to associations in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 , which were allowed to disp@@ oss@@ ess them to their functions , for private purposes .
damage vulner@@ abilities with about 400,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with finance .
this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ ler Department , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , one of them .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity &apos;s accus@@ ation laid down the defence that the association was at no time a lecture at that time .
the sports officials only counts on allow@@ ance and the sport club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and invested in it a lot of time and money - the liabilities were raised in 2001 to approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( rd 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stopped to the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we go on or un@@ lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the Bre@@ ad collabor@@ ator of the financial am@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then co @-@ accused of taking this task together with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money to put our life insur@@ ances as safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money free , there are only no debts .
furthermore , - in appropriate financial compensation - the withdrawal of allow@@ ance for the allow@@ ance declined by 1991 .
therefore , when a plus had been issued on the account , one of the allow@@ ances for years later , as a plus on the account had been paid out .
thus the ex @-@ form@@ work and non @-@ detailed bus@@ hes are explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ pi@@ als managed the two def@@ endants , said the second accused .
why the non @-@ out@@ flow of the association did not appear in detail , the judge asked .
the association did not aim in detail for financial results ; it was important to have the debt of debt , such as the answer .
in 2011 , a total of 120@@ ,000 Euros had been issued in an account for the official investig@@ ating authority , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was sent to the club account .
that had been , the def@@ endants had been declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
the respon@@ dent was no answer for a long time .
then he said finally , he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody knew anything of that money that the public prosecutor set up in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ endants had been inform@@ ing , justi@@ fying the function@@ ary .
this transfer has been form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why do not claim damage ? , judge and attor@@ ney wanted to know .
the first accused was saying that he was not able to agree with this formulation , because the association was never materi@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a pro@@ xy ? &quot; he asked .
moreover , the function@@ ary said he had never covered a cent of content , calcul@@ ating only o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ ets .
at the board of di@@ ets , he paid a charge of € 1,000 a month , but the actual cost had been much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years were not able to point out the def@@ endants .
these are after an operating test , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer have been kept , declared it .
mileage also included the second accused .
all of these discipl@@ ines are avail@@ ble , and in addition , he had to go from his dwelling of international law to the bank to Blei@@ k , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on September 23 , with the survey of witnesses .

the costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will therefore be saved by the company on Tuesday .
the step will result in a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall off from the fourth quarter .

time of decision on interest rates for US bank@@ note
the world is observed when the US bank@@ note bank passes two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether the first time has raised interest for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned about Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , and now think that the F@@ ed will hold a little longer and the interest rates on the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will hold .
it is an historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate has been NULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a great central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said angel U@@ bi@@ des , senior employees at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is at a relatively good performance , trillion dollars will be added to balance and generate only a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ ader outlook on global circumstances .
she has warned the markets to raise , but the signs indicate that the odds are good against such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm ME@@ Z on Thursday
death je@@ ze at Delta State University ( sorry for an ap@@ ology )
after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning , before he shot his colleague and killed him on the day , Sh@@ annon Lamb is a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry for the first murder and wanted to &quot; he could not make it aw@@ fully , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer for geography and social science along the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he had shot at someone and killed someone .
lamb had said to the staff of the emergency telephone that the police have to send officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I fired my wife last night . &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; in the house may be , but it will not distur@@ b anyone , &quot; but probably excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted it to be revers@@ ed .
I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot;
after typ@@ ing a note , Lamb Lub@@ ric@@ ated 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing some of his own life on Monday night as polic@@ emen sm@@ ashed around him .
all university president William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between lamb and Schmidt but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , lamb had said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s also had a relation to Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday give there &quot; no information , no proof &quot; for &quot; tri@@ ec@@ ks@@ relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ren@@ tic@@ &apos;s was Shawn O &apos; Ste@@ en , who said they were about seven years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; being a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; to the ground . &quot;
he said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s were his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s has been working online from home , after testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Know@@ les that was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s .
Know@@ les said that P@@ ren@@ tis@@ s who had a dog named Light@@ ning , who had met with lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said , &apos; nu@@ ff said has relatives at a given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot;
when police arrived on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , lamb cancelled his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killing themselves with a shot .
lamb received a PhD in spring 2015 from the Delta State University as his testimony to the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group of enterprise .
as a year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save a half billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1000 executives around the world will cost the work@@ station .
there are new negotiations with the pilot factory .
the Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the endor@@ s@@ ement of mar@@ row@@ ings .
the re@@ organization &apos;s aim is to profit a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenues , the airline divided the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , with Lufthansa , there is no longer a board for passenger transportation .
the cheap airline Eu@@ rosci@@ ence should be developed as odd as possible .
in the Executive Team around Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Mr. Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Eu@@ rosci@@ ence in the future .
with the re@@ positioning , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ rosci@@ ence , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines link its name to the Air@@ line group , which represents the three @-@ quarters of annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the heading of the cockpit of the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the prosec@@ uted strike on this Thursday .

topic of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .

the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes over the past few months .
background is beside the transi@@ tional power of the pilots the austerity concept &quot; Wings . &quot;
it is obvious that Lufthansa in its fight against competitors was ou@@ ter@@ med to the Group &apos;s own approval line .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play months for double fra@@ ction .
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w is a double fra@@ ction of his right B@@ one .
while this left the left @-@ def@@ ending champion for weeping and close it for at least six months of playing , Louis van G@@ aal doesn &apos;t open up hope that Sha@@ w can play back in this season .
the violation was caused by a hop@@ eless attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before entering the hospital .
van G@@ aal said : &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ ction and is located in the hospital . &quot;
tomorrow or perhaps a day later , he had surgery in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens .
in the changing room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ ction , it will take six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a penalty .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , does not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van G@@ aal presum@@ ed that the Italian arbit@@ rer had wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ re@@ meter and a red card were over@@ due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account had been : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how kap@@ ut I am , my path to the genius begins now , I am coming back again . &quot;
herein lies : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V defeat
the European def@@ ender won an additional incen@@ tive in France with the European Championship in France to recover until next June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad crime . &quot;
when a player leaves this kind of damage to the place , everyone is very sad about that .
it is never the goal of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a sur@@ ge as Mexico had played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on a different direction , so it looked like if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ der of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents want to learn soon : if your child is a book , it won &apos;t last long until you almost know it almost .
let it be you , you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book was called to call his favourite child@@ rens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and goes on : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it seems to have missed an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and well , except that the following paragraph shows in which Cameron was supposed to see the action of the book version of 2012 , which added a summary of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ row @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey to see a true tree , is reading &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss ho@@ wit@@ e , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage , and which died in 1991 , is completely unknown .
as if that was not as suspect wasn &apos;t enough : the text of the Brow@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , reads : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ row @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Audrey to win his dreams . &quot;
although he states to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron considers the action of the book so little . here , a unpleasant boy hears the action of the gre@@ ens@@ ed Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ led , sni@@ ff @-@ like being , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; which is rav@@ aged by the name of the trees .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read the Lor@@ ax by 20 times after a child .
a Down@@ ing Street speaker said that the text had probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ Camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons have been delivered , but there were no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult .
to viol@@ ate Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the K@@ ader , the UK for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my card .
I would not leave a down@@ wards .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing list , and the association spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
the ball has developed Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is a message @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the UK @-@ Test @-@ K@@ ader and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
to allow Adam Ly@@ th to be hard to analyse as its principal activities in Yor@@ k@@ shire , of course .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ te@@ es are al@@ igned to results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , being - and I told that - players are their own best voters .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny .
if hopefully he &apos;d kick out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his stance , even if he did not have such good benefits , and this is not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man gets to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - when Nick Comp@@ ton took nine .
only Comp@@ ton was getting the chance to do home and un@@ happiness .
the only accus@@ ation that you can rise was that England first entered the Caribbean at first - but Ly@@ th was in high form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man I highly pri@@ med .
he &apos;s an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire , when he hit 236 for us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
it must be at least the same chances as it did before him , but this depends on the team &apos;s team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ a@@ ea next to Cook make , bringing a Extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and received four Qu@@ icks , appeared and I didn &apos;t have anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t strike there , and this left @-@ handed version has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s v@@ icious sign of cri@@ cket players .
een might perhaps did his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no difference there .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger took his first 38 tests at the first drop before he re@@ signed as op@@ ener in 2001 .
he got three hundred rings immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see his statistics on average 31 with the bats and 35 by the ball - and think , there is a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup packages that raise their hands and the coach have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some smart ad@@ ditions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ ors for the test games could be a master@@ piece .
he is one of the most beautiful guys of the game , who bring a wealth of experience since he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming up for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he &apos;s created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights into which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing cabin can fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with the previously announced .
coll@@ age team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used at the one @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team actors do not define the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs will depend on their jobs .
such decisions are not taken in an easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain acceptance , when the economy has to be held until 2017 in a fl@@ au@@ te
David Cam@@ er@@ ons un@@ paved new negoti@@ ator strategy to keep great Britain in the EU , even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy , &quot; Is it Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought viol@@ ently for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , recently said , states that some member states , such as deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises such as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain itself created a agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing properties that they are mostly not satisfied .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not like it when they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance climbing at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of itself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win ally for reforms .
it &apos;s always around me .
my European friend , who wants a look at the inside of the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets out that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came across some capit@@ als to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we are to stay or go .
Germany &apos;s careful pul@@ ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks evil for it , as it has been doing badly for them as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or replacing its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a stunning effect .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist rights government , Spain one left .
it is difficult to imagine that they can get a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be used to prevent her energy from the UK - something they don &apos;t want to do , because most of the same separ@@ ati@@ st ten@@ dencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately do not planning helpful remarks , quite in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum on 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ k@@ ite , &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how chic the Fle@@ et Street can be on their costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press ar@@ one , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they are able to remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opport@@ un@@ ists who made himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; in Brussels in the early 90 @-@ ies .
when all his betra@@ yal knew Ed Mili@@ band who were his enemies .
to this end , the Med@@ ley was one of the tax princ@@ esses , teleph@@ ony @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers , and the p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ countries that most of our major newspapers have belonged .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought similar to her , but noted that if you are sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , the militi@@ as was more in@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air even when he had opposed the referendum on the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which gave him a back@@ door .
the press also never knew him .
but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a kind of cl@@ aps at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time for me to forgive at risk , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cott Mur@@ al &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ year @-@ old , a mistake at that time and now .
it may take , but he needs to develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I put it in a friendly way - in evolution .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p traditional flower@@ ing material and the wild vessels of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ops can say everyone to say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n said this week , when the sc@@ ou@@ ting in him fought , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ &apos;s appointment of the provoke John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ endant was a bad idea .
it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father feels engaged in television to be loyal to his Labour cabinet @-@ mate , without going far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was more attractive .
but to be strug@@ gling to stay &quot; under all the circumstances - Benn@@ i &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow guitarist and dep@@ u@@ ties to all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the be@@ hr@@ ise bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to conv@@ ey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the stru@@ del of the social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is correct to give Cameron on a ticket for Europe that allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in judicial campaign for granted , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite siege @-@ economy , the anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism is a central basic principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes .
as with his am@@ big@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to outlet - the foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital , they have also mis@@ erable elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this could be po@@ int@@ less ?
the United States are already quite disappointed of the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was re@@ minded of what was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England against e @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that E @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful as smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researcher .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) have joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the &quot; Public Health England ( P@@ he ) report in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have provided the load capacity of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month gra@@ bbed the &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which P@@ he had founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers have written in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expected that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes about 95 % less harmful to smoke &quot; can be based on a detailed review of testing and modelling .
in fact , this statement consists of a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi@@ disciplinary assessment analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to produce their opinions on the damages of different nic@@ ot@@ ine hal@@ ogen@@ ous products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director of British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) was employed by British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , said they .
one of the 12 participants on the meeting said means to receive funds from a e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the financing he should have received after reports from the tobacco enterprise Philip Morris International , add it .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the panel are not shipped , but these include several known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which represent some sector funding in the paper .
some other atten@@ de@@ es at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco leadership took part by the P@@ he .
the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses to &quot; conclu@@ sive evidence &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products at most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no proof that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well@@ being in P@@ he , said that on the alleg@@ ations made by BM@@ J was already re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful for smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smokers dies on its addi@@ ctions .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the unique obligation to inform@@ ing the public about what is proof of evidence and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers on tobacco .
almost 80,000 people are dying per year in a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health Care System two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fra@@ ction of the damage caused by smoking , we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ders , former Chief of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop playing programmes such as East@@ er@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would make their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller crowd , in hard @-@ cont@@ ested time window against the most popular shows of their Riv@@ age and Sen@@ n such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried six years in time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that the BBC programs are on behalf of them or send them clearly by non @-@ subsi@@ dised rival , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you don &apos;t want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I can &apos;t keep in mid @-@ term or long @-@ term , one should put his production at least on programs that others do not do or in order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve a broad support for the future .
the idea that nobody else would show that is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , of course , non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could be financed without a subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I stri@@ ve to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ fiction .
I don &apos;t think that was the BBC to ever decrease .
Johnson , a business@@ man for series who conducted Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to hunt for reviews &quot; because of the am@@ bition of people working there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give it again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ er@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they can not measure the public , but they can go on their duties , and they can argue that they have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one has ever wanted to see .
on the broadcast fee , Johnson said the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions who can obtain the best value of this .
of course , think all , think we all think that 150 £ per year is given a great value here , but for those who get a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ walk and channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC should check out her zi@@ on @-@ mission to form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only few of the BBC production would now officially be classified as a education - he said that there were 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take a look at the publicly @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful of TV are shown , and deal with the commercial broad@@ casts Alli@@ ances to make everything online available .
&apos;@@ son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have cultivated worms with genetically modified nerve cells , which can be controlled by bur@@ gers of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they have with sound impul@@ ses that have heard for the human hearing at high frequencies , to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated .
impul@@ ses are supported by turning on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ os@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain co@@ her@@ ulation , the electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people used to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
f@@ aden@@ worms respond not to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani revealed that they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , rein@@ force ultrasound waves , which inv@@ ade worms into worms .
the ampli@@ fication of ultrasound waves can be found on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in membran@@ es of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves strike the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons bear TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when transfer@@ ring ultrasound to the different creatures , sound waves are intensi@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred into worms , where they shut down the changed Mot@@ onic eur@@ on@@ one .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities to Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool , the scientists will allow neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light and un@@ wind .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ os@@ genetic could have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent down on a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can be un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain of above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily ob@@ sol@@ ete human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting of certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt Le@@ ver was amazed at the silence that prevailed round the advertis@@ ements for the arms trade show - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic setting , but &quot; through the blu@@ ing with bright paints and animation , it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us to shar@@ pen the awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remind myself of the noti@@ fied Sm@@ ile of those who I stum@@ bled - and to the numerous , leng@@ th@@ less complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the train in student residence halls is from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ous up to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , where and where you have taken a Sabbath year , and why you said &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither dear nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you find out the people who like you would not speak to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would be fire and fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people are eng@@ aging and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
right here : do not remember to start at the university with a relation
intro@@ vert a gross treatment at university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ oming culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friend@@ ships , but you must go away so I get the energy back that I used for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow fellow of soci@@ ability is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos ank@@ lo@@ am : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
sealing close with j@@ aw@@ s .
because you start the Uni at the height of the back @-@ mania , the clo@@ cking to the doors of people is prefer@@ able to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s welcome in the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made treats can be a good way to make friend@@ ships .
their room@@ mates are obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will perhaps associate your face with a great surprise .
this depends , of course , whether you are a small b@@ aker .
badly ming@@ led cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat that people make them sleeping , when they drop an@@ ank@@ le .
ste@@ aling food is an average crime in student residence halls .
of course , is the c@@ law of chicken a theft , but does it take a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check out the with the milk owner .
chances are , they say , themselves to operate themselves , even if they are inside the inner .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to handle it as my fellow trav@@ eler , who in their milk to pun@@ ish the vine to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should make no noise , which keeps people from sleep , or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the true sense of saying to man , who are sitting in the glass .
a girl on my corridor asked their neighbors , if it makes them something qui@@ eter , that drum &amp; bass had a little qui@@ eter , because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning .
they acted to him with still loud music .
when they left at 5 o &apos;clock finally , her neighbours had to sleep two hours before she dropped their own music , shut down her door and set off at her three hour test .
would it be romantic if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to be in the same residence halls ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be ab@@ ins@@ ist embarrass@@ ing if you take a co @-@ trial for your future married couples , to take part again and then see them every day and perhaps to see how they over@@ take all together friends ?
of course , the heart is its own way - but if a hot co @-@ hab@@ itation is definitely not your future sp@@ ouse , try to talk about your sub@@ strate a little reason .
in the most exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his non @-@ closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ b@@ bing is more than it seems .
a good quest is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but never fail in any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
shut down your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you will then place in the freezer , but don &apos;t plug their poss@@ essions to the ceiling as twice as twice .
row houses for refugees , alli@@ ons , straight den@@ ser
the real estate agency Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building houses for people who do not have much money .
for example , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only priv@@ ilege of the mother and the straight@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to get cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the apartment market .
entrepren@@ eur Mark G@@ ild@@ ner believes in how quickly the living room can be created quickly : it builds in one project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for the apartment market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass@@ aging accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
in view of the refugee stro@@ ma , we also need enough living space in the next decades .
a quite basic , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that &apos;s different , when people ch@@ unks the people into living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three homes for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each residential unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back .
then , houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , excluding property .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the building took .
that is fair .
do these regulations transform their plans ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : &quot; I covered my project and I had my project correct .
especially complicated , it always makes the imp@@ ending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth special construction and the plac@@ ard order .
cre@@ epy ig .
it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in cities are missing the space .
refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how have people to react to their terra@@ ced house in the house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury cars for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but are you not tigh@@ tened the cont@@ ention for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true yet : we had a building boom in the last five years , but it was built luxury apartments that can &apos;t afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room .
not only refugees , but also the only priv@@ y mother or the fore@@ se@@ er .
I show how you can still get an inexpensive and good service today .
that is why it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by entering the setting application , &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , you can download the phone option to download and then install .
some have stum@@ bled upon the installation , as they get an error message that the &quot; software up@@ dating is failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or trying to update through iTunes .
the telephone itself will lead you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the er@@ asing of apps to create space , but Apple has made it easier for updates , but Apple has made it easier to do so if you set a special tool to delete apps and then install it once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is re@@ charged during up@@ dating , or is located close to a loading device so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue , because the telephone may end up to half way and that this could lead to a demo@@ lition of updates .

Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Al@@ ten@@ acity Anton@@ isti@@ ft was put together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg square .
besides consultations , one can also participate in courses .
the social foundation will descend from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely , at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , will immediately get sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as health insurance or care services .
for years , we have been exhibit@@ ing with our out@@ patient nursing services that often the people &apos;s nursing homes have been left alone .
there are many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not quite often many benefits of insur@@ ers are not entitled , because the complexity of insur@@ ances are hardly understood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the new house architect , J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; service camp as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ dorf also offers prevention , health and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken with the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers like flash prevention , memory training , or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .

on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons .
one of these men ap@@ pers the young man , and struck with his fist on his face .
victims suffered a nas@@ al gel@@ atin and bleeding from the nose .
when his two friends shared , he spoke to the ra@@ cket , this first settled by his victim .
his last young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ rators pursued the group with passenger car up to their flat and disman@@ tled there several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the castle went before the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
using a b@@ ill@@ ary mol@@ es , one spra@@ yed onto the face and the th@@ igh of the victim .
the injured unit had to be made for a medical care in a hospital .
so far only one v@@ age @-@ description is before .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and lined with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asked witnesses and demonstration to report on the number 06@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes practice Fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich und Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen .
in addition , Sam@@ t@@ ach@@ master painter Bernd Bor@@ mann , affiliated to U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ ses Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country there are doctors - As@@ endorf has good luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ lowship on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lowship is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is his successor in the next few months still with half a position to the side .
following a re@@ building phase , Müller opened his practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros into the rooms at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ lowship is met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently complet@@ es her medical research in the late hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; we always had always in mind that the Mü@@ llers were good in that practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was , I just called her . &quot;
the couple Müller served the idea in future to conduct its own practice in A@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Mu@@ eller .
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see being his own boss .
and so you agree , the Mü@@ llers bought the house with the practice .
while staying in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen , they will continue .
the two @-@ time family Man Frank Müller was also grown up there , followed by his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ dium in Hanover in several medical surg@@ eries as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
currently he is active as a senior doctor in Sul@@ ingen , Germany in 2009 , he was appointed a Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and joined hon@@ ors at the DR@@ K @-@ Read@@ Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19 , the practice of the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lowship ausen as a physician , his wife Ur@@ sel ( a female gu@@ ist ) speci@@ alizes in the gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Mü@@ llers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to be slaugh@@ tered .
&quot; the End@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the refurb@@ ishment , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term &amp; loading stations and need a normal room more .
the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of 50@@ 000 Euro received the Mü@@ llers as part of a funding from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; stresses Mrs Anna Bor@@ mann &apos;s citizenship .
approximately 2000 patients come according to Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l every quarter into practice Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another medical practice in As@@ endorf .
a positive side effect by Frank Müller &apos;s practical experience : the pharmacy stays according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had been found , she would have gone .
if you visit Mü@@ llers &apos;s hours , we still have to consider in familiar faces : taking the seven medical experts and the cleaning power from the rings .
when leaving in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medicine has been prac@@ tised for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning , we had two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ res@@ ausen remembers . &quot;
a little melan@@ chol@@ y feel it after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are staying in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients are certainly still seeing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the international lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is comple@@ mentary : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have pressed me with hor@@ ticul@@ ture , now that could become different . &quot;
furthermore , the couple had two grand@@ sons and travels .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls can go up on our southern border , &quot; said the Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner .
the controls on the Hungarian border remain simultaneously upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to create an application for asylum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear , however , &quot; that there needs significant signals , &quot; said the Minister .
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to travel on in direction of Austria and Germany , and under circumstances can also establish Cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look at this .
the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather allow surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary .
the border with Croatia is already very controlled as the outer borders of the Schengen area .
as the Minister pointed , Slovenia wants to put its borders for refugees , but not factories .
&quot; every EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar .
as the Croatian government hur@@ ried , the first refugees had already tried to pass on the night hours on Tuesday to pass on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian Police arrested her in the near corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik ever meet police vehicles with new refugees .
it mainly took care of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children .
the Red Cross is also already in action .
in the coming days his country with about 4,000 refugees , the Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
it would also be some buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had previously surrendered to the Hungarian border so far , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
however , the government in Belgrade imp@@ eded that it was necessary to ban people interested in certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor let us do that , &quot; said it .
in any case , according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Si@@ d Serbian border town , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were traveling around the whole night of the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia throughout the night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has made Hungary , so we told the police that we are to drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
for this reason it could actually be drawn up for ob@@ servers already predicted by the previous Balkan region Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west distance .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive capabilities on boar@@ der control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the case of a strong supply of refugees for possible ex@@ cre@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details he didn &apos;t refer , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive capabilities on border security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you bring strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner has since gained a good testimony from the country , affecting the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian For@@ zz@@ au@@ n .
according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border passes Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees currently want to travel to the Croatian border , is un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister of Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local strike in Hor@@ gos : he keep the debates about the alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be very high refugee currently .
one could not say , whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country .
hel@@ per in immigrants - hazardous - Alternative rou@@ ters
one of them , private Hungarian Assi@@ stance , started to distribute refugees from Croatia , on which alternative routes are inter@@ vening by Croatia .
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war it still does not contain large mine@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team from mine@@ fields was sent to the border region .
listed h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians numbers 30 million dollars

the information market is alleged to have been insi@@ der involved in the financial markets .
this way , according to reports , a total of over 100 million dollars were down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are ultimately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SEC message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case , the trials against 32 further cat@@ ap@@ ults declined .
most of the def@@ endants were from Ukraine and Georgia .

they are heading the two stations of the Mannheim Geneva Motor Show at Par@@ ade@@ platz .
holding the city walls .
pul@@ s@@ ating , pr@@ one life at stunning autumn cou@@ pon and on the middle of four large tables always with the heading &quot; Before I die I &quot; ....
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice remedy made attention with this action on its 20 year existence and sees perfectly confron@@ ted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life is about life , therefore we are going into the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice remedy stands the pass@@ ers as well as questions and conversations , as the volunteer work .
during some a pass@@ ant spont@@ aneously to the chal@@ k attacks and the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; you can read , &quot; with the camper by the U.S. , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; non @-@ long suffer , &quot; remain others briefly , read , say phr@@ ases like &quot; so far I am still not &quot; and then go on .
back on the br@@ ink of little discussions , the action , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger also is on the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I clear that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is co @-@ ai@@ ded with the car@@ bure@@ au association of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective campaign is good for twenty @-@ year @-@ olds .
that not everyone wants to communicate on the tablets , however , be understand@@ able , after all , it was a very personal thing .
the subject of death and dying is still with Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , who just helped the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have contributed much to open the people .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika will be spl@@ itted .
the death and funeral service belongs to the hon@@ our@@ able staff of the first hour .
due to personal experience being confron@@ ted with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in mort@@ al care .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice help immediately sought to call , she was immediately logged and was in 1995 when it was founded .

Angel@@ ika Go@@ di@@ roid can deal with her job well and deal with the experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ te , hold it for precious and like the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .

the tablets described on Saturday are now displayed in the Lutheran Church ( M1 , 1a ) and at the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
more personal requests can also be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the supply of supply trains sent its value for a whole year due to the we@@ aker demand for freight services and higher cost of transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire around 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 investment workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , finishing in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
analysts reported according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
in spite of the price increases , average price increases by 4.9 percent and 4 January , respectively , and despite higher supplements for bo@@ de @-@ transport from heavy and heavy packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said that it nonetheless expect that earnings from cost reduction , higher income , and growth in online trading will be increased compared to the previous year .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith told that the company provides &quot; solid income &quot; in order to consider heal@@ ers as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the Ri@@ val UPS plans to set up 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 workers , roughly the same amount as last year .
in the third quarter ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research and questioned analysts predicted .
sales increased by 5 percent to EUR 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the packs of Z@@ acks answered anticipated $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority routes in recent years , aimed at stagn@@ ating sales in his unit Express Navigation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased its results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales rose by 29 percent while sales rose by 29 percent , but the result was basically flat due to higher charges for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit declined higher prices due to higher prices , while the result of higher labour costs decreased in freight operations .
at the Pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table , to decide whether it is time to lift the Leit@@ z for the first time since almost a decade .
threatening with them at an end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ storey Se@@ ated sa@@ als is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ella and her colleagues draw the nation &apos;s economic interests to all other things .
the central bank provided a two @-@ fold order from Congress : keeping the maxim@@ ization of US employment and prices so stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is an un@@ ri@@ pped third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to get we@@ aned by an unprecedented stimul@@ us by the near @-@ current short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that they grow solid , the latest Tur@@ bul@@ ence on global financial markets have already in@@ timi@@ dated financial markets , this vol@@ atility became increased by the lifting of interest for federal debt - and it is also just by one quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za MEP , leader in economic sp@@ un Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text that would not increase interest rate , increased uncertainty round the global market is sufficient to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which destroys itself on the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted a rate of interest this week .
financial markets nevertheless wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicators that only shows a 30 % chance to increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed has increased the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ist will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promises that an further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average score by 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points , or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy kept the sentence during this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise pro@@ positions at this time , &quot; he said .
if she does , &quot; they have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t fall in panic . &quot;
other experts argued that such interest rate would calm the financial markets as they would calm the uncertainty on when the F@@ ed will be eliminated .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow deteri@@ oration of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had already said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that would be more economic progress required , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of employment in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market this year was solid .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years , and near the level to see the F@@ ed as full activity .
wage gains have shown signs of a recovery .
and although inflation remained constant under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Editor @-@ economist at Pan@@ the@@ on .
but the financial markets all over the world concluded the end of the month after China had used its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average noted in May by more than 16 % below its maximum level when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would increase global growth .
the market has re@@ covering something this month , the Dow is now almost 10 % below the H@@ och of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influence complex co@@ sting , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news had not occurred in the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US bank@@ note .
now he predic@@ ts that they will have to wait at least a month to get the impact better in grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are lots of uncertainty concerning the impact of the US economy , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the principal issues of F@@ ed , so it should not be included in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the bare reference of the then Chief Apostle Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 revealed that the F@@ ed could produce its mon@@ et@@ ary expansion &quot; into tight , &quot; dis@@ rup@@ tions around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined together , from the F@@ ed representatives can be expected , that they do not only advise the developments at other locations , but also advice about other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art as science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ re Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked that month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ operations on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als data . &quot;
L@@ acker , an effective member of the Federal Open Market Committee , campa@@ igned for a rate of interest , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia brought F@@ ed to reduce its lead to 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings , &quot; despite its limited effect to the growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said .
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives went on this cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis like the 2008 market collapse , Adam S. P@@ osen was a former member of the Bank &apos;s Committee on the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ence do not occur close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to enter into the situation in which she is afraid of interest rate , because markets are excited , &quot; P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act will still contain the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is modified , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of the time .

Brazilian Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy feeding
Brazilian p@@ ic organization SP@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy in sho@@ cking way women on how important good diet is during the breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts , which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of amino acids , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake should not be the only dietary change that should take mothers .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can influence the immune system negative .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Par@@ der@@ at Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million Euro TV hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ given gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports grounds are step forward by step forward : in the recent congregation of church buildings , the worked construction application was blessed without great discussions .
before , the panel , among other things , had taken a motion to a build &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; of the valid development plan .
at the &quot; exception &quot; there was the permit for a special form in the roof structure .
so a &quot; saddle @-@ roof &quot; with non @-@ tap@@ ed first and roof @-@ roof was to be erected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hence the planned use of the roof for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we get together a wonderful large south @-@ roof &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in turn of the roof , for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan , lying under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall &apos;s volume is clearly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan is not allowed to have any &quot; exceptions &quot; due to the en@@ forcement , the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally has to restri@@ ct restric@@ tive orders more restric@@ tive than pre@@ diction .
however , the turn@@ around project is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym equipment at the sports centre is a community project between the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs 2.3 million euros are calculated .
con@@ uts are expected from school and latitude .
in the coming end of procedure , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall now is presented to the Federal Council Office .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH , in front of the district , Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , confirmed this surprising lesson .
however , a decision on that would meet the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would work at the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move along with fishermen and the further existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
in W@@ eil@@ heim , the employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should place a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered the change of termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic but has now moved to a private practice near the hospital .
when asked who follow the succession , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who declared ready to take over the line on 1 October and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
fisher@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in the inner department of gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
however , the next two years fisher@@ man with his team , if the Supervisory Board is to agree , both houses lead until then next year , the former hospital in prison , with more than 35 beds , has to be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years definitely .
so far the area planned for 2018 , if the currently ongoing renovation of the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim has been completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who also is chairman of the Supervisory Board , re@@ marked sm@@ iles to what is the house that is owned by the federal government in future as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; I &apos;ll close up . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say , there are several consider@@ ations .
at present there is a short term care of car@@ itas and one day sy@@ chiat@@ ry , located there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better things could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said fishermen about the j@@ azi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understand@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the House in which Fischer has worked for more than 30 years as a chief physician , did not exist .
he was asked of Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to adopt the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been repeatedly threatened by closure , divisions were closed over the past decades and were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ cu@@ ffs of the Rhein @-@ Neckar Region are called on the morning ( 20.@@ 15 ) when the Berg@@ ischer HC .

refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation on the German residential property market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a paid lead .
pressure on the residential market is growing .
social residential construction is faced with a challenge .
the distributor in the German residential property has already begun .
with the incoming refugees and jobs from the EU , more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units must be built by 2020 .
as a result , a study on behalf of the ally &quot; social housing building &quot; comes to this result .
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed this year .
that is why 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in the first accommodation accommodation .
many encounter then in the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es before the rental apartments .
however , according to the Bureau of Statistics , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers arrived in the last year .
the negative development of the residential market is not only rising to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes substantial re@@ ars in residential construction policies of recent years .
Germany Shi@@ fting a housing estate before itself , which is enlarged by year to year .
at the moment , some 77@@ ,000 residential units are missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , said Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many employed people therefore lived in large cities in flat share rooms .
young adults stayed on the apartment market un@@ will@@ ingly longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
the number of square metres per capita has declined in the big cities for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; social construction construction &quot; suggests a restart .
new incen@@ tives to re @-@ stimul@@ ate the social construction industry again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , on the under@@ property tax , and the property tax on subsidi@@ zed homes may be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the alliance , attractive controls are necessary .
the transport program for refugee shel@@ ters in Kf@@ W State Bank has already been well received by cities and communities .
a good week after the start was made by 184 million euros on Monday evening , with more than half of the currently available some 300 million euros .
now the project could even be rock@@ ed .
refugees have free coverage : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
after Hungary , practically no more , there are more refugees choosing the road to Croatia .
Zagreb announces , that travel through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with Slovenia &apos;s neighbour country through establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister , and if it is necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already a Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
according to the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees exp@@ elled after Croatia to arrive in Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian TV coverage reports .
Hungary had sealed its borders for refugees on the day before .
new laws , which came into force the same day , do extra@@ ordin@@ arily superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic explained : &quot; you can travel and we prepare for the possibility . &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had captured first refugees on the border Serbian border to Croatia on the border of Serbia .
most of the media reports are reports from Syria , Iran , and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as with tax@@ ies to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees do not encounter a f@@ ences .
this marks the limits of other dangers : there are sharp mines in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine@@ fields are now supposed to create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , hardly any refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police open 3@@ 66 attacked people .
shortly before the circuit on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ra@@ ils the wind@@ fall and damage of the gren@@ zz@@ ard as off@@ ender .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were introduced into the South @-@ Hungarian border region Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the sentenced sentences up to five years and his deportation from the country .
according to the Immig@@ ration authority , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers have been accepted at the &quot; Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ cy &quot; border on Tuesday , including almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition from R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , there would be another 40 refugees .
practically , nobody has a prosp@@ ect for granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian opinion Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
before the &quot; Tran@@ sat@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only few hundred refugees gathered .
workers began to clean up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage which tens of thousands of people had left off road@@ side during the last weeks .
junk@@ ers were disman@@ tled , and one of the approaches to the border camp was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself to the end of this building .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only runs a few refugees .
moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still took place in the country .
in Salzburg , some 1,@@ 400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing , some smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor set &quot; rocks &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were following the bridge festival on Sunday with the vac@@ ations , as suddenly ten people stood with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ th@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany stopped Germany on Sunday because of the refugee stro@@ ma with Austria , it was no end for them in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , so Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the st@@ acked along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
before , we once again made the un@@ hoped guest once again , with lunch and beverages .
as we have said , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; it was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t seize to give them a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
the marked draw conditions were set up on Sunday evening in W@@ els by an ICE train in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to follow it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but to try over the border .
but the regional train was placed on the river Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein line .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge association with the Bavarian neighbours are soci@@ able on Sunday , days before a ro@@ aring course - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án have now sent another z@@ ig@@ ot to us , is a logical result of apparent politics :
instead of helping to help establish structures in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , human@@ ism has continued to assist and publicly sli@@ t the position of the Hungarian government into the community of the national socialism .
dead bodies of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confron@@ ted in the bor@@ der@@ lands with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the poultry will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which invited them and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge in view of the continued refugee flow and the approaching winter , where people will make decent conditions for protecting patients &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search of 35@@ ,000 Winter@@ stron@@ gh@@ olds
Konrad has filled all his hands with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is it used to have his word in weight .
the government used the former Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker in order to en@@ force Qu@@ arti@@ ere for thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the beginning of the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen School has already gained its grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great host , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ piece . &quot;
the Interior Ministry said , on the other hand , by a &quot; cra@@ cking situation . &quot;
a total of 8@@ 5,000 neighbour@@ hoods are counted in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the numbers , 35@@ ,000 accommodations may be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries to provide 15,000 of the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already talked talks with the local govern@@ ors .
these could guarantee to him , even for the upcoming Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it goes well , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , going to be cleared , as the church will help .
great expectations are the asylum coordin@@ ator also in the ORF action as well as we . &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer accommodations .
on top of this , you will hope to be empty in winter .
Conrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for the accommodation than &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
in times of times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must hold a certain height of the hand @-@ le@@ holder or size of the doors .
for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would be considered .
in contrast to the Ministry of Justice , he was successful with the accommodation , Konrad and his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t believe in the face without truth .
conviction force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause no cost to the Republic they declared themselves .
they are currently wanting to increase their number of employees on three to four .
the own source search was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to open a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
as first , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment when there are those affected by these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
more locations should be evaluated on the basis for emer@@ gen@@ cies .
criticism of the president of Refu@@ ge@@ es within the Federal State of Refu@@ ge@@ es .
other areas have also to contribute to their contribution .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed . &quot;
in a longer telephone conference by the Bavarian Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced further operations in the refugee question on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not mar@@ red .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic are still possible .
however there will be the appropriate border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany there will be no more .
however , the search results were brought to Germany with regular trains .
one of the other EU member states called for more reinforced solidarity in refugee question once more .
the fact that Austria will also check in controls again at its borders , is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the prec@@ urs@@ ors of the Germans .
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time .
the general restoration of the &quot; New Year &quot; in Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six store@@ ys of the office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T are incorporated , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in the IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Dut@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in the startup companies of the New Shi@@ pyard and later to search for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the start , S &amp; T collabor@@ ate with the new neighbours - where Dut@@ haus@@ er expects some things : &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the location , 3.3 million Euros from the Tech@@ Centre , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the Land Ober@@ öster@@ reich and the League ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covering from the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Centre .
about 30 percent of the 2700 square metres remains in the building are already rented , for another 40 per cent give it qu@@ eries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the arcade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are cent@@ ered in the centre .
J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to push the 49 year old In@@ hab@@ erin of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Arctic : finally , it has an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop over the business they sell , among other things , bags , suitcase , shoes and clothing made of different manufacturers , everything is now about to have women hand@@ bags of the Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories for up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long been thinking about whether I am going to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the fur@@ la producers who are at Bologna get home from the idea of a own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only tiny room of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots .
her fashion interest has got Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why such a woman with sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ ent , also the skilled worker cannot answer the last security .
maybe it &apos;s about getting a beautiful bag every out@@ fit .
the bre@@ eder @-@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancest@@ ral of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ gi@@ ants .
this property integ@@ rates well with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether it expresses foreign hos@@ tility , journalists ru@@ de @-@ related , or tri@@ g@@ aps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential council beat the campaign strongly .
and cut along well .
this will also be registered in the pf@@ alz region of K@@ all@@ stadt where the wholesale fish face of the real estate are her@@ eby .
the New Yorker , with the Com@@ for@@ mid@@ ur , is a big concept in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant town is about -@@ ty corners with him related .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the bud@@ sman Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about dump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that &apos;s what makes it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their culture , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
a native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has directed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous don@@ ors , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
while there is respect for the performance of the family , but also , the opinion that Tr@@ ump &apos;s &quot; be a bit like a grand@@ mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the city @-@ city in a circum@@ ference , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher was &quot; - in German : the makers , says she .
thus , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of An@@ gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story started 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant in the U.S. in the US .
the property of the property company was first plot in New York .
but life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : your wish to return to home in the Bavarian state , where the Pal@@ atine was at that time .
he has not recorded tr@@ ump , because he once had been cut out without permission , the director of the Institute of Physical History and Ethno@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ er &apos;s striking statements .
he had repeatedly said about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to strike illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the p@@ added , it &apos;s not so lik@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote relative tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a new@@ born Tr@@ ump , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the v@@ int@@ ner on retirement sees the Americans dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always the one thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; the 72 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; he never took care of a whole town . &quot;
the pend@@ ra@@ tin Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned how much @-@ man K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter men@@ tions that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came to a visit to the Church of Church , which was generally well received .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine the Donald of Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
they thought it better if he won &apos;t have the choice , because &quot; he has made such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
if those who were at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. were like he would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ el &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump was long interviewed , have seen 12 000 movie tra@@ ilers , also w@@ akes up in the USA .
the Upper Bavarian village Ram@@ s@@ au at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Mountain@@ eering Village &quot; in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden .
the vice @-@ President of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , received the 1800 @-@ inhabitants in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park on Wednesday the occasion of gentle tourism .
there are already 20 &quot; Mountain@@ eering Qu@@ ör@@ fer in Austria . &quot;
in the neighbouring land , the German Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants .
at least one @-@ fifth of its area has to be identified as protected area .

Karl Stef@@ anovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but it has not performed large shifts in the USA ratings .
the breakfast show of Nine was aired by the German capital , Malcolm won the Fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , set up in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Cancun .
this down@@ side of the crash seemed to play a role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise was an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at five major cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today Today , we achieved a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number left behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3.000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap in Sun@@ rise over the past months .
in August , Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in the Sun@@ rise of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40.000 and 50.000 .
in September , Sun@@ rise rises at an average 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning more than the Parliament !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pri@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thomson .
the new drama on a recently swe@@ ating father , who decides to settle down with its two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 219 million spectators .
critics had been wonder@@ ing if Thomson hit a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this by a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results on the evening two of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , an average 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ys Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour began with the Chase Australia 5@@ 20,000 viewers and in the second half an hour 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quotes of the second night of The Chase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately end up at 17 : 30 .
the Chase Australia is a replacement for one million dollars that won &apos;t make the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three voices are a bach@@ elor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay , and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may seem to be un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , has been ham@@ mer@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will surely not give away , whether it is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we act with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before three are two , you may acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood complet@@ es his lips up to the final on Thursday
all three women have left out ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and so called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you who won the Woods last rose ? &quot; could their answers to be destroyed , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both sides quickly - except for himself - Mack@@ ay as best partner for Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt they felt quite compatible , and I thought it was quite compatible with all the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on Earth , making it so much fun with her to be along with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be suitable as a couple .
from their point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house@@ keeping last week was her clear that Wood &apos;s Wood could be .
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and my family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s S@@ is aired on Wednesday , 19 : 30 am .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to begin his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle marked great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries to his stunning wedding day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ n chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , when he lost a kind of s@@ angel , as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday during the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ worth the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to be his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
rather than pulling his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ reporter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ek was also encouraged by speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ched Fang and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start taking Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian bra@@ ces for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ ticket 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not be imag@@ ined in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing which is now found , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ n said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ nes confused the re@@ location with his original debut at that time in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ go@@ al area led to a pon@@ der for Queensland .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters call for the high refugee &apos;s attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party leader Hubert Ai@@ v@@ ger warned at the beginning of the FW @-@ Autumn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns &apos;s schools , when it is not according to new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get noti@@ fications in the Bavarian Education System . &quot;
the state survey of the Free voters pl@@ agu@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
actually , some other main topics were provided .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters .
&quot; of course the subject for Asyl@@ um will over@@ lay the c@@ laws , &quot; said Ai@@ th@@ ger .
ai@@ wan@@ ger requested the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria as it gave them during the war in the 1990 &quot; s during the Yugoslavia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t go on , we need to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
state asylum seek@@ ers want to shift the free elec@@ torate as quickly as possible .
therefore Ai@@ v@@ ie also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , which were responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ th@@ ger .
the FW boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistently emp@@ loying : &quot; we would use national standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria dra@@ gons off , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to be more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the National Policy will not fall under the table under the table .
a lon@@ gl@@ asting time is on the agenda : the policy @-@ policy .
for the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started up the pilot attempt at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ ums , with an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ tic middle school from three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to high school .
but Ai@@ stag@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; the FW boss said .
we demand freedom of poll@@ ination for all gymn@@ asi@@ es we want .

festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax help jumps
following a wide range of routes , the German Stock Market closed on a wide range of circuits and nerv@@ ousness .
only in the afternoon , a festive pre@@ lu@@ de for the US stock ex@@ changes made a clear direction , which ultimately caused D@@ ax to decline by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

solid gains also coinci@@ des the trade show in London and Paris .
in the US , the Dow Jones Index accounted for around 1 percent in plus .
many changes are expected to take place in the United States as well after the interest of interest in the United States and also to the major incident on this Friday .
the discussion surrounding the burden of nuclear power dropped by a record deep in the meantime , and has left deep dis@@ closing at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy industry probably covers 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of both biggest German energy companies finally recovered slightly , but ultimately always 3,@@ 31 percent ( RWE ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon @-@ shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax head .
according to a dealer , a positive report by the US An@@ le@@ ger@@ mag@@ az@@ in &apos; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &apos; looked after the weekend .
so , investors currently gave little attention to the German chip@@ builders .
accordingly , investment in advanced waf@@ ers @-@ technologies and the focus should be paid on the car market .
car rates were asked : even at the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were sold more than in the same period of the year , as the industry association AC@@ EA decided to launch the International Motor Show Frankfurt in Frankfurt .
the transm@@ itters of the Daimler and BMW division rose by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed , after polic@@ emen Sho@@ es to prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police attacked rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that were demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , one officer said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the ru@@ pe@@ e district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that over 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were assembled outside of a police station , and some of you threw stones and fire @-@ bomb .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said that the police used Tr@@ än@@ dian and then shot in the air before they pulled to rubber @-@ bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber @-@ bul@@ lets were known , of which it is known that they can kill , but traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , evi@@ dently a high death rate .
the discussion was the last in weeks violent protest at the Nep@@ als Southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ cry i say that new provinces , which are formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ esis , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , divided the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled central for centuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the legisl@@ ature adopted this week by certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
building area planned in the city
the grounds at the Em@@ der Youth Centre at the Alte Post should be restored again .
the city is currently preparing for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square meter area .
planned is a mixture of trade , business and housing - however there is still no concrete offer .
Em@@ den - The City of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square meters of property in the near neighborhood of the Old Post .
the preparations are currently underway .
planned is to use the property for a mixture of trade , commercial and living .
waiting for respective offers , it &apos;s called on the name of the city .
which investor may come , don &apos;t be clear .
no agreements were also signed .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the plot that is on the Ring@@ straße / Main Street , already a few months ago and disman@@ tle it on the existing building .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plann@@ ings for a holiday resort on the Little Sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor publicly announced plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ tra@@ ilers are wor@@ ris@@ ome - they fear the res@@ ale of their recreational refuge .
mon@@ ang has been swallowed up behind closed doors , stir@@ red , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort located on the small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the stakeholders , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der enterprise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System @-@ Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; set up on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council for the first time publicly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the outs@@ et , this point was on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , to which the investors and the administration intelligence , Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds went from the system building management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet received an answer yet , &quot; he said before the Board of the Board and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to face all rum@@ ors now .
the project &apos;s accounts for around ten to twelve million euros has been in discussion since months .
violent reactions among the owners who came in meeting started the pictures and new details for the purpose of the hotel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ gun that prot@@ ru@@ de all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , he fears how some other project critic is that the traffic would be greatly increased by the planned size of the plant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must come whole buses to get that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the well @-@ acre area of the former restaurant hall , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we must have been a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Beh@@ ren@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development factor is still variable .

Google launches the dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign , which is to bring 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that have to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ tax@@ ed the European nations because it will burst out from war and disp@@ oss@@ ess nations .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach during the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of making an manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kabul , wrote her personal experience with her family from Kabul .
&quot; during our journey many dark train and bus@@ cru@@ ises were included , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as refugee and migrants has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately sought to help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations have doubled up to a value of 5.5 million to Goo@@ gle@@ .com / Cent@@ res to be doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

for slightly exagger@@ ated diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily di@@ ge@@ ese people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study of at least five years .
it is too early to say , if easily di@@ ge@@ ese people with diabetes after weight loss surgery may live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery that enrolled a leading article on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss of li@@ pos@@ itas or obesity - use different methods to reduce the size of mag@@ nets .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb nutrition .
over the years Adi@@ pos@@ itas Surgery has proved in@@ efficient treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been carried out with people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng , General Hospital data , which have been collected in a study since 2007 , compar@@ ing two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and abdominal formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans that were slightly exagger@@ ated .
the average BMI of those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 2@@ 4.5 by the end of the fifth year in this trial .
the BMI of those who were non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments remained almost immediately at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , the Diabetes disease was able to completely dis@@ band@@ ed at 36 % .
in the medical @-@ treated group compared with diabetes , diabetes was completely only in one percent and partly with only around two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the inspec@@ tions of blood pressure , tri@@ glyc@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also o@@ vers@@ aw the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
in A@@ 1@@ c , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held below 7 percent .
after surgery the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - how you reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also shows average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ frac@@ tom@@ y Group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , and recorded bigger provisions in the BMI ( 7.@@ 7 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ lap of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of more heavier people in Sweden , that operation is leading to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was involved in obesity people who underwent a Adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ operation , approximately 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tested conven@@ tionally methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said that it was soo@@ thing for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this surgery is lower than the lower BMI group lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone also added that humans and their doctors should start to take weight seriously when the patient is with his BMI between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a conversion is really difficult . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe cannot lodge all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee Crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged them to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , devoted to Ethics studies .
he requested that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be submitted to the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries is admi@@ red on the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama arranged Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to enable the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly by education for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must pon@@ der on how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence as well as George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist bombing of September 11 , suggest@@ ing that the violent response in the USA moved on a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush ; and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set violence , and this has unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of hand dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
toxic control centers in the United States report an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that so@@ p alcoholic beverages , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants reported in children under 12 years that report le@@ thal control centres , by 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the listing , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children will drink dis@@ infection while some people do to im@@ press their friends , or because of a sample of the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of cheap experience .
young people allegedly mixed a disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth@@ wash@@ es to get a harder drink .
younger children can be sc@@ aled by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are dis@@ infection with strawberry , grapes and orange scent that are very pleasing for children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sy@@ ring@@ es may be pois@@ oning with very small children , especially with very small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the hospital at the University of Kansas , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let go around , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a fast way to consume a lot of alcohol .

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays a talk about dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
there is rum@@ ours about dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team &apos;s cre@@ ators are not under elevated control , as they prepare for the confron@@ tation with the Dutch ranking leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football c@@ res Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
former rank @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest at Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show the highlights of Celtic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars D@@ eila .
R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Celtic people must fight , but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things .
after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent depar@@ ting of the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now starts with five points , clearly stands at the top of the table .
D@@ eila said : &quot; Celtic had been bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly like this - but we need to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
ready to stand now .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it grows in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 when the number of people without work for the United Kingdom emerged as a whole in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the total unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent , from 5.@@ 9 percent , was just 5.5 per cent , according to the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( for dating only ) .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.0 percent in the course of the quarter - an annual number of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
commenting on the recent figures , the State Secretary for Scotland , MEP David Mund@@ ell , commented : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be doing an execution in Oklahoma
somewhat later , except with a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in an on@@ look@@ er gallery in the Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to have one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was first mentioned in January above his best friend , and even though I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came out , I started to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story through the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications than places available , there is a macro lot@@ tery instead of decide who is elected .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spots from 12 to five .
who will be selected , who will keep it exciting .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot , when we speak .
the jail authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Oklahoma accused me t@@ wit@@ ched on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants it , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
she admitted that she could have put it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong , what I &apos;m doing .
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I have told and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can always remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international writer is present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter for the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please hear the show of Podcasts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go here again for all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ es would witness him to be a terrible fact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be real objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , in which you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards attempted to es@@ pion@@ age him and threatened to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he placed on the ste@@ wards and the integrity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do that which is best suited for the racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions as it did not explain the positive cob@@ alt @-@ blood sample at Li@@ dar@@ is .
he had been post@@ pon@@ ed for 18 months for es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ation and did not want it to look like too high dro@@ oping grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been sitting for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at one time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I &apos;ll go home today and sleeping well .
I want to go in the drawn way , and I want my owners think I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I won &apos;t be a coach .
I have to consider what I &apos;m doing with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had tried the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity unit had tried to sp@@ ying his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown , and Dr. Brian Stewart in one room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously feel that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should be sure to express itself in their n@@ oses , because they have been trying to put me back .
Robert Rou@@ ss@@ ston , former chair of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting president of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , whose current CEO Route L , were aware of this today and are still today .
should it take me to think that it is personal ?
has the RV@@ L sit down and makes people responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking that I am there .
maybe you have to take my license and rep@@ el me , and I have no doubt that what I say you can think about it now .
but I have arrived now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ strations levels of the Trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt test at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching lead to that he could &quot; bring &quot; his license above the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ lag@@ ged Master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack@@ et of mud or tone has been applied to the dra@@ fting of the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my members has taken up mud on the leg .
it would have been so night yesterday .
it would have been like yesterday all the day , which was so .
but it was like that on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the race day . an investigation into the matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who make this rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy coming back to Ring@@ ier &apos;s alleg@@ ory of alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as the &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites in N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators brought the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring@@ tone &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ Vic@@ tory in Sydney on Friday night .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly clo@@ aked remark to the Storm team , after his team had reached the final victory at North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sample example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland will not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ash of his team and said that they were only focused on &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading train@@ ers in his team are confident that it means they were worried that they are concerned with the Storm @-@ Team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ ier as they spoke to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing at our def@@ ensive System or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles for a real emphasis , and that made the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously did a great team . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a little shock for him .
it is funny , as this time again appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked its idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and his ment@@ or reminds that Benn@@ ys St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons took the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
he set his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and , as she was exciting , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said that he will take care of a sh@@ it .
but now he has a team that can play and that &apos;s exciting as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so that they can play as they play .
I reinforced up trust , because they are saying these things because they are a little concerned to have to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters recorded a higher score as the game of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks out and do not contain any points of cl@@ amping ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means we will still be met in a phase .
the Storm @-@ Team has free this weekend as it won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning .
ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ W@@ ail on Drug St@@ ability
one man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence threat@@ ens for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was beaten up to Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was watched as he def@@ endants his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a probably life imprisonment for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that there was no proof that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café it might have been more harmless .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the lack of danger at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often traveled to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in case of death he lied the police upon his where@@ ab@@ outs .
M@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step @-@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the s@@ worn aff@@ id@@ av@@ its of these two persons it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real monetary expression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Judge flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be sufficient to hold him out of it , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , among the conditions that he reports to his Australian and his Serbian Pass on the police daily and keeps itself at an out@@ flow of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

according to D@@ WD , the Black Forest , in the Black Forest of Al@@ b and Lake Con@@ stance , is still counting from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour in the Black Forest region .
on Friday the sun can look back again .
the mass starts it : every two years the bus device at the IAA tell their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , especially movement with the compact cars that are currently particularly well @-@ selling for the compact cars .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly high : around 2@@ 8.1 percent of new regi@@ strations were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , a lot of new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept vehicles and luxury cars .
one of the largest premier@@ es for the German motor@@ ways is the Astra , which will stand in autumn by dealers .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel starts just a start of the competition VW Golf in a view that starts at € 17 650 .
the current Astra will cost € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.6 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
moreover , the H@@ esse offer additional diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engine .
unlike the major competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is show@@ c@@ ased only as one @-@ fifth model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the estate , which is also shown at the IAA 2013 .
and what will I drive on new compact cars beside the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will release the fourth @-@ generation of its Astra &apos;s competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair Mé@@ gan@@ e is available only as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and one @-@ empha@@ size sporty GT version .
in the beginning of next year , it comes as a w@@ agon .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ offsprings aims to find his position in the highly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti also fits in the design line of the brand with its curved lines .
the basic model will have a fuel engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , who is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is available with gasoline engines , including a new 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
its maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton metres ( Nm ) .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed , the compact D 4 compact class model is completely re@@ done at the IAA Motor Show .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Citroën presented above all hands at the front end : here the radiator grill was rev@@ amped and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was fitted .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and is integrated for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a range of re@@ work and new variants such as the raised Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are human @-@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the Te@@ gel &apos;s pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , which has lived for months in a small prison cell .
due to the violation of her human dignity , prisoners were generally entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in too small cells .
this decision adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision on Wednesday .
those affected by the judges can even hope for money if they were imprisoned for few days in the narrow rooms ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
he was an ex @-@ in@@ mate to be successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe , Germany : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s figures , was now on the un@@ laid , laid out in a larger cell .
his arrest warrant was th@@ war@@ ted because of the degra@@ dation conditions against the land of Berlin .
however , the Constitutional Court over@@ took the decision of the Berlin chamber , pointing to the revised inspection .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Kammer@@ ral Tribunal now decides on the level of compensation .
even though for legal reasons , only a few days of detention to compensation are decisive for compensation , a compensation was given .
otherwise , &quot; a mis@@ mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal rights of the personality is to fear . &quot;
the Chamber of Chamber now must clari@@ fy the amount of money damage .
the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they said only in April an in@@ mate of damages , because he was in prison naked in a prison cell .
human un@@ worthy is according to a 2011 decision , also the multi@@ ple@@ tion of a cell without separate toilet .
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed the court of a criminal court which un@@ ites a criminal record in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then ra@@ cket was within three months away from 15 to 21 hours in the same char@@ tered fre@@ ak as in the Kar@@ ls @-@ Kar@@ ls .
in the last weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons came to headlines in the headlines .
prisoners are therefore kept back in 23 hours , aggressi@@ veness of aggressi@@ veness , even to sle@@ e@@ av@@ ens , it is supposed to have been due to the ten@@ sion@@ ed situation .
according to information about the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel for young def@@ ences are not occupied , 19 should be discontinued in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany according to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , according to the declaration of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany &apos;s position to include one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again , &quot; We can do this and we create that . &quot;
what comes up in Germany is the following overview .
used according to various projections between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously is built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatically , but predominantly at affordable rentals : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to apply for this particularly advant@@ ageous housing .
Federal Minister of Culture Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut : 80 000 social dwell@@ ings every year and that would have to invest a funding in the amount of € 6,4 billion a year .
in addition , scientists and federal government agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
based on estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Professional Research that long @-@ term , 55 per cent of the poultry industry can be employed in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically being questioned after their qualification to help them get started , Mr Walter , a project manager for integration and education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung .
for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ rations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the throne , in Germany , a political transition has been added : from working to refugees for recognition of work .
while there was a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ces that are limited to asylum seek@@ ers .
in society , too - due to skilled professionals , it is mainly aimed at the visibility that refugees are to be made faster with access to the labour market .
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
so far , there is no choice of access to general and vocational language courses .
research is also indicated that work@@ stations are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
the construction of networks is therefore , on the view of the throne from the throne to labour integration .
the Berlin school office has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents feed their children in the Kit@@ eline , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oted parent , Il@@ ja is a schem@@ atic , a spokes@@ man for youth and family at Berlin Senate Department .
to convince the family , however , to convince the advantages of the Kit@@ a , the management hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the need of educ@@ ators strongly increased by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacities by increasing more technical colleges .
in the countries , students are prepared without German language skills in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , including teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack in them , Be@@ ate says from the Berlin school office .
the German Karlsruhe student union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study in Germany .
basically , no federal asylum seek@@ ers or in fo@@ amed the university - the only exception to so far was Berlin , In@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) but has abandoned its post@@ ure now .
a study of refugees could be facil@@ itated by the university .
for refugees with a residence permit or dul@@ c@@ ation , no services under the asylum seek@@ er act will receive more if they begin studying .
the latter is basically no B@@ af@@ ö@@ G since they do not fall under the circle of af@@ ar@@ able persons .
refugees had to have been living in Germany for the past four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ G . this Sp@@ anne was reduced to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but this funding gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Karlsruhe student union .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ G .
in the future , Islam will play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , the religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should be successive to Islam to defend the same rights as they have churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches rights to a new State @-@ religions ratio .
the foundation of an Islamic welfare platform was also important to take care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
thus , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and are willing to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to disman@@ tle certain control options .
this also involves the willingness to take action against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism .
the chairman of the central council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Ma@@ zy@@ ek , commented on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered by Germany .
those who wanted to interv@@ ene such conflicts in Germany will immediately have their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future .
in order to change the majority of the majority , the mining of discrimination and rac@@ ism is forced to change .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade ago a Anti@@ dis@@ krimin@@ ierungs@@ stelle , and a general Gender Equality Act .
but it is very slow , as the NSU @-@ string series shows , in the police and authorities discovered the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organisations and the stakeholders ni@@ ch@@ tw@@ ei@@ der have been committed to Germany for as long as the international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism in Germany must be in the next few years if the country will peac@@ efully and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany was able to medi@@ cally care for the expected refugees so far , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes .
&quot; as for managers and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said daily mirrors .
however , additional money has to flow to the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery Heights is calling for all references to the registration of healthcare cards .
additionally , services could be accounted for by federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited power catalogue that see the asylum seek@@ er act .
otherwise make the physicians to create the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been demonstrated , migrants are treated earlier than other patients .
not only in clinics , including medical practices , have to be taken over by medical practices .
for many refugees , many refugees have already been helped to out@@ patient medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
and with another diagnostic look .
under refugee children , there are considerably more untreated Dis@@ abilities , and with the young people go it to HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
Mont@@ gom@@ ery was born in Mont@@ gom@@ ery in Germany with some other chronic diseases .
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; and as regards the temp@@ ting of anger , even in sight of the refugees .
the Syrians have had a highly developed education system , many refugees even doctors .
to practice , however , they would have to pursue its quali@@ fications and ex@@ or@@ ably ex@@ termin@@ ate their tests .
at least half of the refugees in Germany arrive in Germany is psychological ill after estimates of the Bund@@ sy@@ cho@@ lic therapy ( B@@ EC@@ K ) mentally ill : most suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
in particular , refugee children are especially vulnerable , &quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recent study by TU Munich published that every fifth Syrian refugee children is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post@@ p@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is , among other things , suffering from the so called Flash@@ backs with breath , dizziness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and death scar@@ es .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , severe scre@@ ams and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic , a early treatment was necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
yet , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can establish a request for psycho@@ therapy , the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , non @-@ social workers or physicians , who are not educated for mental illness , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to false estimates , says Mun@@ z .

Zimbabwe : Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly throughout social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions of MPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous threats and were warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with be@@ hr@@ u@@ alties .
last month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions @-@ politicians SMS messages received on their cell phones that were warned against Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said rep@@ orters to Mu@@ gab@@ es &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government of the Parliament warns that immun@@ ity ends in Parliament and soon as soon as they aband@@ on Parliament , its parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective .
the chief speaker said that Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried about the dangers for politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard is investing up to 30,000 new jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to add 25,000 and 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings for the company &apos;s services .
today , HP will share in two listed companies in two listed companies and the computer and printer business from its faster @-@ growing company hardware and its business activities .
the expected vac@@ ancies leads to a load of more than $ 2.7 billion , in the fourth quarter , HP said in a statement .
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive cost @-@ effective , more sustainable cost @-@ structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP leader and Chief Executive , which aims to split the unit after separation .
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is greater and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better prepared than ever before , to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; is entitled to providing in@@ accessible , integrated technology solutions to businesses , &quot; thus a company &apos;s explanation .
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930 &quot; s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Dave Packard , to manufacture electric plants and whose Palo Alto Garage was named &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring , to tackle the return of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the most recent in this area that is based on the belief that a tight companies can produce better performance .
FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta telling that te@@ amm@@ ate must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that there was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario suggests that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace of this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ears had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then found again to his old sw@@ ung during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of inf@@ rin@@ gement does not resist the career , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone which healed not well .
this is no major issue .
this was just an accident .
it didn &apos;t stand in conjunction with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he previously had .
this may be true in the medical profession , but as Wen@@ ger also recognised , there is the appropriate danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return to the middle of the season .
it also develops a unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd regi@@ sters 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ear since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in the last five playing games in only 65 of Arsen@@ as .
the bro@@ ader picture for Arsenal is that it has been one of the two Premier League clubs in 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , to list the most vulnerable stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the po@@ aching rate will last over the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a more vulnerable period , a time when you must strengthen your body and gain mar@@ tial strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves .
Arsenal begins with his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the Chelsea games on Saturday and at Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and turning a rotation within the team .
Mr. H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia . what does Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta have to be started .
Wen@@ ger can begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to hold the balance and give to the players who require it to treat a small sni@@ ff pause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the largest b@@ ays in Europe with the largest b@@ ays in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday , whereby it was measured at the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that arsen@@ al has moved out the doctrine of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains of the far hope , with his management to lead the club to its first europ@@ ean triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; says Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
friendship Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friendship
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to what the need for men to open , now more desper@@ ate than ever has become , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high @-@ peak .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and three times more frequently in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ich ( CA@@ LM ) announced a campaign against a pe@@ tic life in 2015 , with the aim of asking the culture in question , to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart piece in struggle to master this challenge .
a current study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms were that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; his chances are doubled on gen@@ esis .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mental healthy friends reduce the risks of mental problems .
but of course , one must first have friends to work for a friendship .
in the age of social media , communication , focusing on the substance via substance , the in@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital life have doubled the need to be strong , cheerful and successful , even if domin@@ ating the isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values : money , image , social status , everything at the cost of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner vision for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared that money can really not buy .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by its personality , which was sh@@ ined by the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Chand@@ lers @-@ Frequ@@ ent hu@@ gs , moments in football look in cozy arm@@ chairs and the nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can relate to any case , even if they often meet , completely their feelings to explore .
as one employee of the telephone session it told me : &quot; my role of listen@@ ers who feel de@@ pressed and def@@ ending themselves &quot; has really clearly shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
the old Rede@@ mption , &quot; I come with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like feeling that it is perceived as weakness , when speaking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me in the sense when I try to offer long @-@ term irrig@@ ation mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so highly my objective exterior status via the phone to people in eye look and desper@@ ation may help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you can sit around in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone alone , give him a smile and tell you hello .
you never know which difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits the city to help PS@@ G , to make Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malmö .
di Maria takes us his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the Game Report and the response to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain started his Champions League with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the front @-@ par@@ ting stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players who took the French master on their way , but afterwards they missed out a number of occasions , before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani reported a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess Don@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A requires a strong start to the Swedish champion , since it is not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out laps , but a improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they received the points , it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ably &apos;s chances in front of the gate . he was later in play against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , which he began his lively career already in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it is a good start to gain 2 : 0 to look back our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I regret it was not one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned home after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which was on the weekend a 2 : 2 Draw out at its own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was out@@ cast in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian whis@@ per was named as the man called the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he got taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he em@@ ph@@ oned off when he ended up in Marco Sch@@ rat@@ a Pass behind the Malmö Wil@@ and finally ended on the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big victory that was disappointed .
Malmö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off struck at this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National players on the field and participated with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field with a rock@@ ing opponent .
but except for a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ urs in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave up sometimes , with some mal@@ pe@@ els and bad connections , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which at no less than five attempts in the first half were patented and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had taken it after the restart .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which was transformed into a shooting down by Di Maria , which was held by Wil@@ and in the 50th minute at the point of time ...
the second goal was finally reached after the hours mark thanks to the Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thought that Malmö could go back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the final result before the replacement player E@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi got a fool at the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we played only in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualifying games do not range . &quot;
hats off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

just a few years ago the FC Bayern stood shortly before the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for the FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champ@@ ions , three times champion winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion world champion , twice champion world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stun@@ n@@ ingly .
in the summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add sport club to Qatar .
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was standing in front of Barcelona prior to the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we won &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered as of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ or@@ ig@@ saw wanted me to have . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in the movie .
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the African film maker Eff@@ ie Brown , while discussing the diversity and said it wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday night by H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown , when they empha@@ sized the need of alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen film script .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then you do with the movie &apos;s occupation , and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown shocked , with loaded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian k@@ rep@@ j@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the centre of production Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to consider people to think about it - who will always be the director , as they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown said .
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ shell , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People prevailed for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film . Dam@@ on answered that their direc@@ tives &quot; could give us something that we do not want . &quot;
when the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded about Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger across the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in space , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are coming at a time in which the exact rac@@ ist representation is in the media at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves had a nationwide effect and urged the legisl@@ ature to raise discrimination against color @-@ related practices .
in February , singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black live , albums are still their meaning .
in more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News trial Elisabeth H@@ assel@@ beck , whether the group was to be considered as a hate group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter &quot; network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of Enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le that were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope , it is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports@@ men and operating instructions Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
the contest show , which completed its 7th season , never experienced competition , who could conclude all levels of its obstac@@ le course .
during the season finale they made two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , to the finals .
the rock climb up to a 75 @-@ foot rope in 30 seconds to climb in the last challenge .
B@@ ritten concluded the task within that time because he finished the first athl@@ ete who completed the ti@@ ring Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior League . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge for a full three seconds faster than the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned over 10,000 $ or more than $ 10,000 , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ ap of money .
so very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed set himself with The Hollywood rep@@ orters to discuss the finals and why B@@ ritten , although he finished first at all the course , did not get any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it receives one of the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , it receives a great gra@@ ffiti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think he &apos;s get a res@@ ent@@ ment over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he &apos;s just so lucky to have done what he has done .
crowds of awards were given by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m happy that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac might have felt as felt when they re@@ jects the roles .
America Ninja Warrior became an eighth season - the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks up to Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ WS L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once again they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today , the tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday to the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins spent a chance to climb in a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to gr@@ asp more than half of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon stopped his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two routes , then once in sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck three times at the age of 1 / 3 and made it possible for three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and so I want to go into the game completely .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two of us , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit song by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has eff@@ ected the pl@@ ywood all well , &quot; said Aus@@ mus .
he looked good off while ( ra@@ mmer training ) , saw clearly better off in the bull@@ se@@ ye , and he got it right into play .
with three R@@ uns in the back , the T@@ wins had their best chance to hit the game again .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double of the left field line .
Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon brought his second bases Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy left @-@ handed .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man faced with whom he was confron@@ ted , in front of the newly @-@ designed Rookie chan@@ ger Miguel S@@ ano who was a two @-@ run @-@ run .
with a pair of l@@ ender and the final @-@ run during the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ff on a Double Play .
it was the major league in the major league of the 27th times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ fs beat a double Play
at the end of the ninth Conference there was a Insurance Run , the wall made an R@@ BI double to the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however the right @-@ handed S@@ ano has three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by a still mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hughes .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two ten@@ ings to the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been scra@@ pped in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list , after that he had been missing for more than a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hughes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I was dischar@@ ged and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter we got a single out of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success @-@ series with the Run@@ er in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third b@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to enter the third , leading the threat .
the tig@@ ers lay in the second , resulting one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one two @-@ out single from center F@@ iel@@ s Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; T@@ wins &apos;s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he has not been very well defeated , but he got the right spot .
Hughes found himself in a Pit@@ ch Count , no points scored in the third inning , before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver Right A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hughes there was three R@@ uns in six hits and one Walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sanchez was eliminated in a violation of throwing training .
he is being studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 .
Sanchez , on the mid @-@ August on the risk of injuries , shall be activated for the launch on Wednesday .
with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the vulner@@ ability list in order to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since August 20 because of a di@@ stortion in the right th@@ igh .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in target field on Wednesday

Isch@@ l : German military measures in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; I think the definite re@@ thinking of military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said .
he threw the European states , &quot; collective gu@@ ises . &quot;

on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers wanted to take a new attack on a non @-@ binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries with the first intake and distribution of people .
in late Tuesday , the alliance will jointly announced that Merkel met after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chancell@@ ery in Berlin on Tuesday evening .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , do not confess this too .
but those who do not have a lead eye , could not remain in Germany either .
this opinion was also agreed in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole has to handle an &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees get stuck on the Bal@@ kan@@ route .

nearly 500 years after the Re@@ formation , Rome is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
the presence of the city President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino was buried in the park on Wednesday as well as famous place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German reform@@ ers .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of Re@@ formation . &quot;
the park lies in the middle of Rome , beside the Col@@ osse@@ um .
the nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature was held in Rome from the Lutheran churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ minded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority .
with the place , symbo@@ lic@@ ally , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ ine mon@@ k to be held in Rome for the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he recommended the city then as a desc@@ ending sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions must be encouraged by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther was then initiated by his Th@@ eses against the holding in the evening of the Western Church .
hammer artists had invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus , with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn @-@ crown is one of the main works painted with the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has been published with magnificent pictures .
at the beginning was the picture of Ot@@ mar Alt who form@@ ulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; Language &quot; with colorful paints and imagin@@ ative forms , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - but by no means is syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective subjects are adapted , that may well be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has hit a sub@@ jective artistic choice from the many them@@ atic areas of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are of cycles involved with topics such as cru@@ ises , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds , or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
he has been fascinated by several partners spont@@ aneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on artificial books .
this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who discovered himself on the basis of painting with the respective biblical references .
he interpre@@ ts the interpre@@ ter &quot; interpre@@ t &quot; by Ot@@ mar Alt and so today translated into current relationships . &quot;
these lyrics are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who form@@ ulates his own personal thoughts about the situation here .
the je@@ wel has golden cou@@ sins .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows dou@@ bly a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
that is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately triggered for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin in 1940 , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened at the time with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up that , perhaps , to bear me again with the Lord &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second purpose is to help art in a faster time again . &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is characterised by pro@@ ver@@ tise , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed out there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewers &apos; look into the pictures , letting them feel , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost admitted and on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; we &apos;ve always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &quot; : &quot; I like how he gr@@ asp his images life . &quot;
I did not pay attention to enum@@ er@@ ate the Bible , but chosen for him most important , also mysterious issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text expl@@ aining only . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was written a pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öhler by Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to find &quot; his life for deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öhler ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and fla@@ x images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
construction start for BM@@ X track drew near
plans were made in place , companies were commissioned to model the earth door@@ bell for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was over again .
par@@ is@@ ations in politics and administration provided for land@@ fill , especially with residents who did not toler@@ ate the train .
so Hill off the top , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for construction permits .
the auth@@ orization will go into operation in October , the first congregation of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock was now able to communicate at the child &apos;s youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still be visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without &quot; additional commem@@ oration &quot; there should be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the Bundesliga starts a significant sign in the weekend .
the football is respon@@ ding to the self @-@ escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures the politics of its assistance in dealing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be all interested to get this topic in the handle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B manager Wolfgang R@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the Chancellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the soccer could and would help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must be put to politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German soccer federation has therefore added its refugee organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a four years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues to continue until 2019 , &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA Meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal gi@@ sts support this program too .
already this weekend the 36 promot@@ ers will put an obvious sign if they are going to be put on the left tri@@ cot@@ ta instead of custom@@ ised sponsor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) to help &quot; We aid - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ head Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Image &quot; paper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; sel@@ f@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every one , no one shall see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need to use soccer rules , no , we need to use our jet power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees that have already been so incredibly diversi@@ fied , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
for the Euro @-@ qualifying match against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
Nier@@ s@@ bach described the assistance of refugees as a great community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license parties have started in their own projects would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest Ver@@ eine are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we have spent is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of tremendous significance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year , the Association has been working together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government each valued 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum of the whole sum for 2015 is also called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP board leader losing an eye
the Executive Chairman of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost several reports by fall in July , the left eye was lost .
at the accident on the steps of his brother in the USA , he fell to a water @-@ glass blowing at midnight , which he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thirsty , he was ready to go out on the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could but his work go .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Pl@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is with the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully operational . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , which will come back to Germany in October and will continue to the software integration .
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I understood all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and his chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the U.S. , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again when you have fallen . &quot;
McLaren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ ussen except skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ ussen is a photo , and explained that he suffered the injuries when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he is therefore working as a reserv@@ ist in Singapore following the weekend as a reserve for the two head@@ ings Fernando Alonso and J@@ enson Button , just like a week later on the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund has consistently sm@@ ashed all hopes for a com@@ eback by Marco R@@ eus in the first group of Europe .
the national player will also miss the table leader in the soccer league in du@@ el with the FR@@ Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 @-@ Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t return to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B @-@ Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from it to Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its stem @-@ position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ step &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes place the place of name @-@ keeper Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised the World Champions League &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether the Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all European League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el is open however .
at high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the expl@@ aining statement of players R@@ eus , that the final train for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League had to be the goal , is holding a mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ ghts for retro@@ fit : &quot; so Marco is not that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to get the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot@@ ic cars : government wants an iter@@ ative role for Germany
following the will of the German government , Germany will be the pioneer of the cars technological pioneering .
on Wednesday , the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided a strategy paper from the home of Transport Secretary Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Auto Show , from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automated and connected drive will increase traffic safety and worry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject , with his counterpart , from the G7 countries , with representatives of the industry .
the commercial programme of the German Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and an immediate environment on digital radio teleph@@ ony .
at the testing of new technology there is currently a track route on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
with the driver &quot; no additional traffic risks arise , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check and verify the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , to custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Germany will use it to be international that the permissible maximum speed of self @-@ prop@@ elled car is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government also wants to put up a change in the Vi@@ enn@@ ese convention , which only fore@@ sees human beings as a driver .
when automated driving takes over , the car takes the lead , the driver will get more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that use the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Commerce , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all driving cars on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany estimate the study by 2025 to approximately 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to greater safety and efficiency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic authority S@@ ören Bar@@ rage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue of liability for accidents and safety of personal data of the driver has to be clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still skep@@ tical cars - much more than French or Americans .
a Wednesday based on the AA survey carried out by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ sa Institute on behalf of the D@@ sa National Institute is that only eight percent of the Germans think that autonomous cars in the next ten years have risen , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 per cent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025 , and 33 per cent by 2025 .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the Bit@@ kom settlement , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the highway , you could imagine no less than 15 percent in the flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
every fourth one would leave the car under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ Euro
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to fight at present in the title fight from September 25 to October 4 only in singles .
the final decision was to fall by the latest on 22 September .
&quot; that is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to grab the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM studies in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the way to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing sponsor@@ ing event in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to go back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ham@@ let , who calls the S@@ etz@@ alt@@ in@@ burg in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg as well , rec@@ alled the EM 2013 into a Schwe@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , Timo also missed , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared World Ran@@ kings Fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has dra@@ gged a heavy injury to the right leg .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mix of very big fashion show and a qu@@ ins gr@@ ump@@ y Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul G@@ aul ( 63 ) presented a exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ ne@@ quin , which seem to look very sc@@ ary thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designers , who , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s out@@ fits , became the great star of the fashion scene - and so that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can &apos;t say today that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant since the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be very light , meanwhile it &apos;s real &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; G@@ aul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that fashion designer rests at a show about his person .
actually it was , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had already done in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits provide an insight into that hardly an over@@ looked work of man , written history , without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it &apos;s a well @-@ chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall work that was used for much effort : to fresh@@ ing the pupp@@ ets , for example , a styl@@ ist was hired .
14 tons of material have spar@@ ed the cre@@ ators according to the survey by Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot after Munich .
just before the start of the October festival there was still another special treat : a leather watch@@ man Out@@ fit with cor@@ s@@ ett .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gaul@@ tiers of an art ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ matic modified secret experiments of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in football ) he was wearing his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , G@@ aul said .
with a doll , his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play .
he then taught the t@@ oss of fashion to himself .
he ste@@ ered fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , such as G@@ aul in Munich .
later I bought them , however , of course .
for his first own show he could not pay the models .
they did not get anything , but they were able to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener head as fashion niche
early in the past , we went to the long hor@@ se@@ wing machines to make pl@@ ush about that .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were made in great amount for customers , which they worked for example , blank@@ ets and curtains .
the only works today no longer works , Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Mo@@ Equ@@ al Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important .
in the early hours of Pl@@ au@@ ener lace fashion , fashion has played an important role , and was subsequently pushed through the home textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
even the so @-@ called vintage fashion , re@@ jects the past bul@@ ls , is an increasing client of the or@@ deal .
who serves no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market .
they already make up half of all orders already .
Mo@@ lei@@ itze bo@@ ils , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association of pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they must carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years around 80 per cent of sales are broken .
private specialty stores and wholesale accounts do not exist anymore .
our products are hardly able to reach our products on this path .
today , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian area and driven almost exclusively through chains .
moreover , export the export , currently to Russia and to the USA .
so enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association is also attemp@@ ting to score through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery to Falk@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a quality label that shows that we produce eco @-@ friendly and soci@@ ally toler@@ ated . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
she teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg University of the West@@ s@@ äch@@ s@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to opp@@ ose the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and enterprises , which have to think of all economically , says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design will often be slightly varies , to keep a client base .
some years ago animated fabric designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter newly re@@ fresh the historic snow sp@@ ire .
the machine st@@ alls little ch@@ icks along some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith &apos;s Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ ts inspired him to be inspired : &quot; previously I was able to start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now they use the snow tip for their jewellery .
in a lav@@ ish@@ ly process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip -@@ both young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter .
it also supplies the United States , Australia and Finland - especially customers whose ancestors had lived in buildings and its surroundings and want to die a mem@@ or@@ ist .
with this , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ ener tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not touch it , but Disney yet will nevertheless turn into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; it &apos;s not a novel mode , but in a sequ@@ el to a sequ@@ el , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny &apos;s family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years later to Julie Andre@@ ws , is still un@@ clear .
but the director stands firmly : Rob Marshall , least with the &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; in the cinema .
XI p@@ ushes to open the economy closer to the world
the economy has to open a wide view to the outside , to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the reform of reform .
&quot; China should use commitment to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the central control group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
new generation to promote and promote reforms will cause new moment@@ um and vitality , and offer new place for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list on the regulation of market access , complete relaxation of border controls policy , promoting private capital ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the local population system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that sectors and companies identi@@ fies that investment does not come into question .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance since the market has a major role in the allocation of resources , a legally governmental business environment , and the market is open , said the statement .
the government is also close to inspec@@ tions which are transmitted to the company and ensure that businesses can decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the framework of a offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas of private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will bring legal interests of foreign finance and deliver better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners , to apply for permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by simpli@@ fy the requirements and facil@@ it@@ ating the application process .
the right to ass@@ ure the lawyers to practice their activities , and to dep@@ loy their professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides such as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in one after the declaration published .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ levels in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes , thereby increasing the consumers significantly higher dose of nerve .
the food organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is presenting a corresponding paper money in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects are missing industrial and environment policy , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have increased the limit values of the nerve in the end of the food chain such as shar@@ - or wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of one to two milli@@ gram mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly polluted with mercury so that the limit values should not be sold around 50 percent of the cat@@ ches .
after double the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would only be in@@ comprehen@@ sible .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limits imposed on other fish in other fish from currently 0.@@ 0.5 mg to 0.1 mg of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch describes this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish such as car@@ p generally are so low that they already comply with the planned maximum limits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ usal of de@@ fle@@ ction man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that is highly abundant through the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly in inf@@ ant damage of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Commerce explained on its website with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat of the public population &quot; is not expected .
mercury is mainly spur@@ red in the environment by coal combustion .
according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Commerce , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ eb@@ u@@ ck ordered more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total population in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and stress @-@ covered , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had quoted from the paper in March .
last year , mercury @-@ wide war@@ nings already accounted for the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF .
