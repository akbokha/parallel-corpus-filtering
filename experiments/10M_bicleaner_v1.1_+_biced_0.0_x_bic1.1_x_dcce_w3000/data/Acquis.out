the effectiveness of re@@ agents in the blood @-@ group@@ ings exist ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ compatible anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in comparison to the International Standard award or state standards in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 937 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .

this on the label to raise the exp@@ iry date for dry mort@@ ality depends on the results of the tie @-@ care tests ; it is approved by the state supervis@@ ory authorities .
dry mort@@ als are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ duced gas or in a vacuum technique , while in the glass container , which it has been dried , and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry matter should lose a maximum of 0.5 v.@@ H. of its weight , if it is tested by additional drying on phosph@@ or@@ pen@@ tox@@ an in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible State authority can determine that the re@@ ag@@ eing ( or with the dry agents for sol@@ v@@ ents ) is an antis@@ ep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the responsi@@ veness with the added substance remains the pre@@ conditions of speci@@ fic@@ ity and effectiveness .

the determination of the international exchange of certain re@@ agents for the blood group will not be painted , at least until as long as the International Convention has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ings are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that it is sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown ble@@ eding , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the substances that may be used in a tank @-@ sensitive amount must be so great that the contents can be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratories has led over all the production levels and controls of re@@ agents for the re@@ group@@ ing written records .
appropriate samples of all per re@@ agents are as long as possible to retain the laboratory for a long time , until a number of probability that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ group@@ ing used re@@ agents can contain substances human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these are the effective part , the others are the necessary means to reinforce the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the Re@@ ag@@ ence .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the source of their effective participation .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin , contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
on every single vessel is a black on white printed label in English and French language to attach the following information : 1 . name and ad@@ ress of the manufacturer ,

anti @-@ D Ser@@ um is derived from the blood of one or more persons , immun@@ ized by the anti@@ gen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells , which contain the anti@@ gen D , but not with human red blood cells , which does not contain the anti@@ gen D .
