this document is a summary of the European Public Health Study Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is discussed how the Committee on Human@@ gers can be assessed ( CH@@ MP ) to get recommendations on how to use the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the box office ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please refer to the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tabl@@ ettes ( tablets that occupy themselves in the mouth ) , as a solution to the One ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) .
B. Re@@ place thinking and Spe@@ aking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , with which patients manage many episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal high @-@ mood ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal spirits .
abili@@ fy will be applied for the treatment of severe and severe Man@@ bic episodes and to prevent voc@@ al episodes in patients suffering from the past on the medicine .
injection solution is used for quick control of disturbed accidents or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to the one or the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets can be applied in patients , which the si@@ sts of tablets difficulties are prepared .
in patients simultaneously take other medicines which will be ab@@ abili@@ fy the same as abili@@ fy should be adjusted the dose of abili@@ fy .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; d. h. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and di@@ op@@ amine , but in lesser extent as neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , carries Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psychological or man@@ ic symptoms and their re @-@ occur is prevented .
the validity of abili@@ fy that can prevent the re@@ occur of symptoms , was investigated in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases which compared to stri@@ ped un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , abili@@ fy about twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the efficacy of abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to re@@ occur to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that has been compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( an other anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change in symptoms of patients had been examined using a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suggested by the treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body re@@ ert the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets and the solution to the incorpor@@ ation ( takes up ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients showed the abili@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms of stag@@ iness as the patients received a plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased abili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies have been more effective than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks in more effective than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ emergence of significant episodes involved in patients and when it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ doses fell also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of stag@@ iness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of abili@@ fy to take ( observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ in@@ duc@@ tive disorders , co@@ ding ( sw@@ elling ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , fatigue , fatigue ( increased sali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia .
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , which had predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the prob@@ ing episodes of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ual z@@ ole spoke to the risk exce@@ eds the risk .
moreover , the board came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution in the rapid control of conf@@ isc@@ ated accidents and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and in patients with some episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risk .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted to Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of abili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predomin@@ antly man@@ ic episodes and their some episodes of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ual z@@ ol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended initial dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
a increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended initial dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , independently of the meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combining therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficiency of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven .
considering the larger sens@@ ations of these patients should be considered a lower initi@@ ald@@ osis , if clinical trials justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ indu@@ ction is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ ual dose @-@ dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to mental illnesses and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases since the beginning or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was not a hei@@ gh@@ tened superf@@ ici@@ an risks compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied with caution in patients with known kar@@ di@@ ovascular Diseases , car@@ cin@@ ations , t@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ ony pre@@ dispos@@ es ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ at@@ onic drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ zel@@ ched and mal@@ ign@@ ne form ) .

if at one treated with abili@@ fy patients signs signs and symptoms of a Sp@@ ät@@ dy &apos;s poetry , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient &apos;s signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns has to become all anti@@ psych@@ otic , including abili@@ fy .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ ali in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at states that are associated with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cies in connection with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psych@@ osis who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an elevated death toll compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the cont@@ acting for undes@@ irable zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ ual patients to be treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ acid or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients suffering with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events in aff@@ abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drug @-@ treated patients who allow direct comparison .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ valence , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly monitored in relation to a deteri@@ oration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ic , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , where weight gain is known as secondary effects and could lead to gra@@ vely complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally located pharmac@@ euticals with excess side effects as se@@ ed@@ ding ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H@@ 2 Ant@@ agonist of Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a Mag@@ netic acid @-@ Blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , although this effect is not considered to be clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy prostate , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) replaced by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ oxet@@ ine and par@@ oxet@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be done similar dos@@ ages .
at CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isation , the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ mat@@ z@@ ol result in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively v@@ abol@@ ism .
if we consider the common gift from ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors to abili@@ fy should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential benefits the potential risks for patients .
other highly @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV reproduction inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dos@@ ages .
after setting up the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised from abili@@ fy on the dos@@ ages before the start of the Beg@@ leit@@ therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 will be administ@@ ered together with abili@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ an@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol per day showed no significant effect on the met@@ abolic disorders of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ual z@@ ol .
due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the tox@@ icity studies on animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the possible benefits are just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk to the fet@@ us .
however also in other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication the patients should be warned of , dangerous machines , including fuel vehicles , to use until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence .
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( M@@ 1 / 100 ) than on plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ related side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the below effects is defined in accordance with the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .

the effectiveness of myst@@ ic@@ ane was examined in a major study , participating in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , by which approximately three quarters had received a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of abrasive bl@@ ane ( in all@@ ele as or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the one conventional ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicine . ( given in combination with other drugs on reducing side effects ) .
overall we talked in the main stage 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with abra@@ si@@ ane treated patients treated to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatment .
if one regards only the patient , which were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference to efficacy issues such as time to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients were treated with patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that abra@@ si@@ ane has been more effective than conventional ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may not be used in patient , breast@@ feeding or before starting treatment low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ic figures in the blood .
the committee on human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) fixed that abra@@ si@@ ane has been used in patients where the first treatment was no longer strikes , more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that it has to be given in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication drugs to reduce side effects .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar to that already in the European Union ( EU ) and the same substance contains ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference rate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure levels , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications could occur if prior to the procedure is an idi@@ ous ble@@ eding that is not possible and in which a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1 800 ml .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , the experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own ble@@ eding , Ab@@ se@@ amed to in@@ ject into a v@@ ene .
injection can also be made by the patient or their supervis@@ or if they have received proper instruction .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and patients who receive chemotherapy , the Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bet@@ s should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per rap@@ il@@ ite in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are in front of the treatment to ensure that there is no lack of iron , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered during the entire treatment .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems may be an an@@ emia caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ ic or thereby , that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in also is used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which they are committed to the formation of ep@@ o@@ il@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to administration as an injection in a v@@ ene in the frame of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , with the reference rate .
all patients participating in this study had been attacked at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ene before they have been amed either on se@@ amed or continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ cane between the beginning of the study and the trial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the Company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of col@@ amed pre@@ cip@@ amed were examined by the skin of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received a chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ orrho@@ bin@@ ary values have been changed to Ab@@ se@@ amed , in the same measure as for those patients who continue to received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients continue to received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output level of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of a enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ alls and turbul@@ ence .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients who might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ in al@@ fa or any other components .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this is triggered by any allergic reactions .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ itt@@ le ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied in patients with a high freight risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ traum@@ atic Hip break as in the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ wing , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip canc@@ ers should have received a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of P@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( funds against inflammation ) briefly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced in the three days after infection signs , such as fe@@ ver , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ related symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for treating the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the substance in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is as in Zom@@ eta , became a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta to assess a@@ cl@@ asta .
the first study was involved almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the amount of sp@@ ine and hip re@@ visions were examined over a period of three years .
the second study com@@ prised 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had reported recently a gir@@ dle re ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies at a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ati@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me which exp@@ el the bone subtle ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the starting point .
in the study with older women , the risk of hur@@ ri@@ gend@@ um to patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) has been reduced compared to the patients with plac@@ ebo by 70 % compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those on plac@@ ebo the risk of hip re@@ frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip contracts , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repet@@ itive inf@@ usions less frequent .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be applied in patients who might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against bri@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic , or other bis@@ phosph@@ or or any other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ aten patients are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ asta the risk of kidney disease , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( dying from bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta puts high awareness material available to physicians to use A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , the cl@@ ues as to the drug use , and similar material for patients in which the effects of the drug has been explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7,5 % at A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients compared to 8,@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) was the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly gift from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at related to the percentage change in Len@@ den@@ wir@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the starting point .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ ff A@@ cl@@ asta has been studied at patients aged 30 years with radi@@ ological findings , especially ligh@@ tly until moderate Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ wing ( middle Ser@@ um @-@ Spiegel of al@@ kal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ triple to 3.@@ 0@@ triple @-@ specific top standards for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of inf@@ usion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is shown once a day compared to the intake of 30 mg cr@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months in two six months studies .
in the combination of the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain improvement was observed in comparison to the starting point for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients , which were classified as Respon@@ si@@ bilities used at the end of the sixth month ( on the therapy ) , could be taken into a follow @-@ up phase .
from 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at presented patients who attended the follow @-@ up stage , the therapeutic approach was compared to 141 of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at trad@@ ed patients , maintained at a moderate period of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 mins sever@@ ing Inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid at 64 patients takes the following pharmac@@ ological data , which proved to be dos@@ sh@@ red@@ ly independent .
after that the pl@@ asma @-@ bri@@ cks took quickly upon &lt; 10 % of the maximum @-@ value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0,1 % of the peak .
R@@ asch@@ es bi@@ ous dis@@ appearance of the big cycle with half @-@ wer@@ times t ½ α 230 and t ½ sl@@ ums , followed by a long elimination of Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ s@@ wer@@ ts@@ zeit t ½ ty 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and ß , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid Res@@ cue in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion on the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 h you will find 39 ± 16 % of the administ@@ ered dosage in urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ s@@ ine - concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( pl@@ as@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing out of cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ Enz@@ ym@@ systeme met@@ abolic substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not abo@@ li@@ zed by humans , and because it is a watch@@ ful or even no direct and / or irre@@ versible , metabolism of inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient @-@ groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amo@@ unted to 64 underground patients compared to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
it follows that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney stress , up to 35 ml / min does not require tin modification of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
as for heavy kidney dys@@ functions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ Slov@@ ath &lt; 30 ml / min ) only constra@@ ined data are possible , there are no statements for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ known chemical war@@ ri@@ osis was for mice 10 mg / kg body weight and at R@@ atten 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs were conducted individuals of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ D the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al over@@ flow .
sub@@ chron@@ ous and chron@@ ous tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application , which amounts to 6 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ minute intervals , administ@@ ered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dosage , which corresponds to the 7@@ fachen of the human therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , suited ) , well toler@@ ated .

the most common finding in studies with repet@@ itive application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in Met@@ aphy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all d@@ osing of doses , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of substance .
on R@@ atten we observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and those of sk@@ elet@@ on .
on rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo have been observed , although the mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity at 0.1 mg / kg was marked as a reduced rate of calcium @-@ calcium levels .

Abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Study Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) which is discussed how the Committee on Human@@ gers can be assessed ( CH@@ MP ) to get recommendations on how to use the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not in ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ) can not be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( Dual@@ therapy ) .
it may additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) which cannot be adjusted in the highest toler@@ able dose with met@@ form@@ in alone .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ t@@ ant or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fu@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants or ins@@ ulin can be kept at the beginning of the ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( lower blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the physical ins@@ ulin can be improved better and the blood sugar levels , which makes them better to adapt to type @-@ 2 diabetes .
in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ y were examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ severe hydrogen , in addition they received either AC@@ O or plac@@ ebo .
in the studies the concentration of substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes it possible to cut blood sugar levels in the application of the d@@ osing of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ t trial , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic acid contained in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values to 0,94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo for a reduction of 0,35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , instruc@@ ting the Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared to compared to the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0,69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who were additionally plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( cold , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ ana@@ esth@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
accounts must be applied neither in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic ket@@ ac@@ al ( high bri@@ ghtness ) - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos within a mon@@ otherapy ( in use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients should serve with which met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission divided the European Commission to the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of accounts in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white , white , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also shown for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar has been inadequate and in which met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance is in@@ appropriate ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced kar@@ di@@ aler reserve .
patients should be observed in symptoms and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and oils , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previous advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports on con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
for patients with increased output level ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be deplo@@ yed to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times of the upper limit of the standard are increased , the liver enz@@ ym@@ es are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient &apos;s symptoms developed to refer to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clar@@ ified , fatigue , we@@ aving , fatigue and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ es to review .
the decision whether the treatment of patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on continues until progression of lab parameters should be guided by the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain is demonstrated that may be ag@@ greg@@ ated by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid head .
as a result of a hem@@ orrho@@ id , among the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction of the middle head ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and of the ha@@ emat@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4,@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ angi@@ yl@@ har@@ ness and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ at@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .

the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ atur@@ c ( observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values .
in particular , in patients with cardi@@ ac applic@@ ants , there is also an increased risk of certain side effects which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human@@ gers ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that A@@ den@@ uri@@ c was more effective in lo@@ wering of the uri@@ c community at the blood was more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

if the Ser@@ um fluctu@@ ate pre@@ cip@@ ants after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , can be considered a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 120 mg 1 times daily .
in patients with severe kidney stress , effectiveness and safety have not yet been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ domestic Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .

liver conditions Dur@@ ing the clinical studies of phase 3 have been observed light sn@@ aps of liver @-@ values in the patients treated with Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver treatment before the beginning of Feb@@ . treatment and in further course depending on the clinical trial period ( see Section 5.1 ) .

the events reported during the long @-@ term group studies reported events were similar to those mentioned in the studies of the phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following action @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups all over once and performed in patients who received the Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long term extensions ( up to 4 years with a random amount of &gt; 1.@@ 900 testim@@ onies ) , according to that occasionally occasionally .

clinical studies results Die efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C was shown in two P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and fact study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ qu@@ leu@@ ka@@ emia and po@@ isons .
the primary efficacy point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three months had specific Ser@@ um generators &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 269 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um ass@@ um@@ ination to study start of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed with regard to lo@@ wering the Ser@@ um tit@@ le@@ ci@@ sp@@ y under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 x daily ) compared with usual doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact @-@ study showed with regard to the continued reduction of the ser@@ um ro@@ id@@ sp@@ y under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statistical significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily across the treatment with conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lo@@ wering of Ser@@ um ro@@ ber@@ id@@ sp@@ ar to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in week 2 and maintain permanently on the entire treatment .
5@@ 09 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ating &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl , 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary ri@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney stress .
AD@@ EN@@ URI@@ C became the primary efficacy demonstration of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of ser@@ um prolifer@@ ation in trials , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary ri@@ ver@@ tex in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um domestic waste @-@ con@@ cent@@ ri@@ cally 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and fact @-@ study ) had a ser@@ um prolifer@@ ation of EUR 10 mg / dl .
the data gathered in two years accum@@ ulated data of the open renewal programs at &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) estimates that less than 3 % of the patients required in the months 16 @-@ 24 an treatment against a ch@@ ich@@ ch@@ ub ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed not treatment against a ch@@ ich@@ ch@@ ub ) .
this was associated with a reduction of lact@@ ation size , which had a complete dis@@ appearance of the G@@ ich@@ t@@ k@@ otes to month 24 as a result .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5,5 µ@@ I@@ U / ml ) were observed in patients carrying out a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients , the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term ext@@ ender studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum pl@@ asma @-@ cent@@ ri@@ cians ( C@@ max ) and the area under the pl@@ asma @-@ centre curve ( AU@@ C ) by Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at after administration was simpler and multi @-@ pl@@ ers of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ate increase .
after taking simple or multi @-@ per oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 times a day , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.6 µ@@ g / ml .
however , not a clin@@ ically significant decline in the percentage of ser@@ um prolifer@@ ation observed if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state @-@ state player ( V@@ pp / F ) by Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after in@@ gest@@ ion of doses from 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the pl@@ asma @-@ binding sam@@ pling of Feb@@ lin@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9,@@ 2 % ( prim@@ ion bonds of Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is above the concentr@@ ations wide that is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vit@@ ro @-@ studies on human life @-@ mic@@ ron@@ ome showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abolic path@@ ites are formed primarily by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 and that Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ oni@@ d mainly emerg@@ es from U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

these findings are seen as a result of a specialist @-@ specific Pur@@ pur@@ viol@@ isation and urine composition and for clinical use as non @-@ relevant .
it has been established that Feb@@ .@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have an effect on the fertility and re@@ frac@@ ture of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are bre@@ w ) in women after men@@ opause , where risk is made for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or import@@ ation of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vital substances ) .
to avoid a irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not take care of after the first food intake of the day , that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the efficiency of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in relation to increasing vitamin D con@@ spi@@ res .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels had been treated with patients , which were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE ( 11 % ) than those who were exclusively a@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also placed data to set out that which is required in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE &apos;s alt@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose which is exactly the dose which is required for the prevention of a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal , dr@@ agon@@ ies , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , c@@ aul@@ ts , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , store@@ ys ( Ul@@ c@@ era ) of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus ( gor@@ ges ) , tri@@ c@@ apping ( ab@@ brevi@@ ated belly ) , and dish@@ on@@ ous ab@@ dom@@ es ( infl@@ ated belly ) as well as sau@@ ces .
in patients with event@@ ual hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
it may not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emp@@ y ( low cal@@ f levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage or dispos@@ able of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vital supplements ) for the day .
the following information is to be followed precisely to reduce the risk of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is to be swal@@ lowed after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not follow the tablet consuming , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should be carried out at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ tical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal ble@@ eding or surgical procedures in the upper Gastro@@ intest@@ inal tract , except for P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
est@@ s@@ oph@@ age@@ al responses , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Stri@@ pes , rare in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly were these severe and required a hospital transfer ) .
the doctor is therefore alert to any signs and symptoms which should point out on possible mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out at the appearance of symptoms of mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain , or new or become more lim@@ mer@@ ged of heart@@ burn , pain , or to get medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe os@@ oph@@ age@@ ant side effects seems to be increased by patients carrying the medicine out properly and / or it depends upon the appearance of symptoms which are on a mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all d@@ osing capacity will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large trials of clinical trials at Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no elevated risk was observed were rare ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and associated complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , has been reported in cancer victims , whose therap@@ ists predomin@@ antly administ@@ ered intraven@@ ously tr@@ ams .
there are no data available to give the notes , whether the sequ@@ el of a bis@@ phosph@@ ate therapy in patients who require a sh@@ ale surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the j@@ aw .
the clinical assessment by the treated doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in any patient on the basis of an individual benefit risk assessment .

it is advised to perform common controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m tal@@ mirror during the first two weeks after the transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c controls during the maintenance therapy .
blood level of blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m should also be controlled according to Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ age adap@@ tion , changes to immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances , which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ enforcement blood @-@ centr@@ ation ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f has a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , custom@@ ization may require multiple days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies allow that successful treatment in most cases is possible when the ev@@ asion in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the level of blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and when a heart transplan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent enh@@ illing therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts were usually used blood configur@@ ations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m under@@ - or ex@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always remain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ formulation and the appropriate daily dosage should only be carried out under the eng@@ aging control of a doctor &apos;s transplan@@ t physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion , which proved themselves with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants as therap@@ eutical care , are still no clinical data for ret@@ arded form Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
in favour of proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ts at adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts in the child @-@ old are still no clinical data for ret@@ arded form Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions , which can lead to a lo@@ wering of the Tac@@ ros@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and a mit@@ ig@@ ate of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , is the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant breeding during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations performed in the blood , since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood levels can be subj@@ ected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , was referred to as a car@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which therefore may also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ an@@ f .
further factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ically disorders , an already existing heart remedy , a treatment with cor@@ tico @-@ hem@@ orrho@@ ids , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liqui@@ ds and oils .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to the appropriate clothes or use of a solar protection by means of a high protective factor .
when patients taking the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , symptoms for PR@@ ES as head@@ aches , changed levels of consciousness , cr@@ as@@ ms and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence metabolism of Tac@@ ros@@ li@@ m and thus reduce the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m .
it is therefore recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels can change at the same gift of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m dose to maintain a moderate concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

advance is used for treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII conditional , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ ots ) .
dosage and frequency of use are directed after Adv@@ ant@@ age for the treatment of ble@@ eding or to prevent ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII lack of ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human pl@@ asma , but a method designed as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to form the formation of the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII .
advance is another in the European Union approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , however , is made differently , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human@@ ic or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients suffering from severe to moderate ou@@ trag@@ e@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was analysed by means of prevention of ble@@ eding and in surgical procedures .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ant@@ age in prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new ble@@ eding were awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
modification must not be applied in patients who might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against the human swe@@ eping factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of B@@ ax@@ ter AG to appro@@ ve Adv@@ ent in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment are based on the gravity of the factor VIII Man@@ gels , after the place and extent of the blood flow and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following pre@@ rh@@ age events , the Faktor VIII in the corresponding period should not pass under the specified pl@@ asma seal ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the pain and the acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger exists for the patient .
during the treatment course , the dose of sei@@ zing dose and incidence of inj@@ ections are advised for an adequate marking of the VIII pl@@ asma @-@ cell .
individual patients may be able to differenti@@ ate themselves in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis made by ble@@ eding in patients with severe h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be boxes between 20 and 40 i.e. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII pl@@ asma is not reached or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to im@@ pose a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be promp@@ ted .
the inj@@ ecting speed should be directed after finding the patient , whereby a maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising antibodies against factor VIII is a known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Faktor VIII purpos@@ ed Ig@@ G Imm@@ unity lo@@ bul@@ ins , which are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da Einheiten ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plas@@ ma through modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say qu@@ anti@@ fied .
the risk of inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ relate to the extent of exposure to VIII , taking the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position of exposure and other factors .
in previously untreated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure and an@@ am@@ nest@@ y known inhibit@@ ors was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product at another , the re@@ formation of ( lower tit@@ ular ) inhibit@@ ors .

based on the data available for the initial marketing application , the CH@@ MP will continue to be judged positively as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored during the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a contribution from PS@@ UR@@ s all 6 months required , decided that the fil@@ ing in 5 years is intended to apply another leng@@ th@@ ening procedure .
December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited registered the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma &apos;s Committee ( CH@@ MP ) officially recogni@@ zing that the company decre@@ ases its application for approval from Adv@@ ent to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the past@@ ure ( tissues that connect other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) of this .
this is a type of virus that gene@@ tically modified so that it can be gene in the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is an &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been so altered that there can be no copies of themselves and thus do not trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ent could have been car@@ ved in the tum@@ ors directly and permit the canc@@ er@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is not formed from the def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , is usually contributing to the restoration of damage DNA and to the killing of the cells when the DNA can not be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ Gen is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the canc@@ er@@ ous cells may continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study involving a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ taking , in the bones and in the brain .
after CH@@ MP tested the responses of the company on the questions provided , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the testing of initial documents , the CH@@ MP tag creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , S@@ MP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ent in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ tum@@ ors will bring benefits to the patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medication by means of the body , the kind of administration , and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not proven sufficiently that advance can be produced in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the CH@@ MP did not know the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal of consequences for patients have currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ata @-@ Use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are set together that one of the effective ingredients immediately and the other is released across several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ on@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fe@@ ver , characterized by an all@@ ergy against pol@@ len , inflammation of the nose @-@ tract ) in patients with no@@ stri@@ pes ( mu@@ til@@ ling nose ) .
for adults and teenagers from 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ on@@ ze is recommended twice daily with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be completed as soon as symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ stri@@ l ( hidden nose ) , pro@@ kl@@ ed .
a total treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main @-@ efficiency dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the loc@@ u@@ ine symptoms , which were reported from patients before starting treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment reported .
during the study , patients bore their symptoms every 12 hours into a di@@ ary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in looking of all h@@ ay @-@ symptoms , except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ on@@ ents reported on a decrease in symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in patients , the p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nose @-@ stri@@ l was regarded , the patients showed by Aer@@ on@@ ze loss of symptoms by 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients that have des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ on@@ ze ( observed at 1 @-@ 10 of 100 patients ) are ach@@ y@@ ness , we@@ ster@@ oids , psych@@ omot@@ or@@ ic hyper@@ activity ( ill@@ fulness , head@@ aches , head@@ aches , fatigue , ins@@ om@@ nia ) , som@@ ni@@ pot@@ ency ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ ni@@ pot@@ ency and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ on@@ ze must not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other constitu@@ ents , against in@@ no@@ rep@@ utable agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not to be applied .
Aer@@ on@@ ze must not be applied in patients who suffer from a Eng@@ angle glau@@ coma ( sh@@ ame@@ ful water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have an hem@@ orrho@@ id stroke ( caused by a brain ble@@ eding ) or have an risk for a hem@@ ost@@ al stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission of the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Aer@@ on@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is in the whole to swal@@ low ( that is , without cr@@ acking , to cr@@ ush or to ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ on@@ ze should be applied to in@@ consistency and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) not to be applied in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after closing the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as for long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ edr@@ ine with the period can take .
according to the sw@@ elling of the sw@@ elling of the s@@ lu@@ ms in the upper respir@@ ation because the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
da Aer@@ on@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amin@@ ox@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after ter@@ mination of such therapy .
this is attributed to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ eph@@ edr@@ als such as bro@@ od@@ crip@@ tors , Per@@ go@@ lid , hy@@ bri@@ dal , di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security and effectiveness of this combined therapy were not tested for this patient and the data are not enough to address the dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety and the effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ ents were not tested in patients with kidney or liver and the data are not enough to address the dosage .
patients must be notified that treatment of incidence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die or damage of pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia , nau@@ sea or et@@ w@@ ai@@ gen other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) .
in treating the following patient groups , caution : • patients under digit@@ alis • patients with cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ nation attack in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ stering , or bron@@ chi@@ on@@ ess in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ on@@ ze is to susp@@ end at least 48 hours before implementing such a biological tests , as anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka may otherwise be able to prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce the extent to their mag@@ nit@@ ude .
in the context of clinical trials at des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole additionally administ@@ ered were not clin@@ ically observed any clin@@ ically relevant interactions and changes in the pl@@ as@@ ep@@ tic centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the outcomes of the psych@@ omot@@ or@@ tic tests could not be detected significant differences between the patients with lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients independently of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol consumed .
this has not yet been identified for the met@@ abolic ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enz@@ ym@@ es so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 will not be in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ head .
the irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ess of the use of aer@@ on@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison with the normal population .
since reproduction studies of animals can not always be transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ stri@@ kt@@ or@@ ical properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ edr@@ ine , Aer@@ on@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be clar@@ ified that in very rare cases it may come to a stu@@ per or the ability to use machines .
symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS @-@ depression ( Se@@ aling , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular ab@@ col@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stim@@ ulating ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ) with possible let@@ arian susp@@ ects .

A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and juven@@ iles with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who had also as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( ju@@ ck@@ wheat , number and size of the qu@@ add@@ les , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and the performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ weeks treatment has been established .
further studies have been submitted to detect that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to take , and the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in the same way increases as the tablets and the use in children is harmless .
in allergic rhin@@ itis conducted if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % in comparison to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients taking a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms were after six @-@ weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients with plac@@ ebo @-@ trad@@ ed patients .
A@@ eri@@ us should not be applied in patients who might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted approval granted by the European Commission for approval of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
a tablet every day , with a or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
full &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is limited experience from clinical trials for effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine to young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent rhin@@ itis ( incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should take place according to the previous disease course and may end up after the finish of symptoms and res@@ umed when res@@ ins .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( incidence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the all@@ ergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have been evaluated in the scope of clin@@ ically studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole additionally administ@@ ered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical research pharmac@@ ological study was in@@ duced when in@@ gest@@ ant intake of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol is not reinforced ( see below section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be dec@@ eived that in very rare cases it may come to adverse cases or the ability to use machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects reported on the more common than when plac@@ ebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth@@ wash ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0,6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years the most common side @-@ effect of head@@ aches were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and were treated at 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary study , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ een clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ inflammat@@ ory cy@@ to@@ co@@ ins such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ ast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the here@@ tical frame P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ in on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ ous cells .
as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ p@@ ants , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine administ@@ ered in a dosage for up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval .
in an individual dos@@ aging study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective stro@@ kes or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , itch , irrit@@ ation and red@@ ness of eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms can also be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the result of the overall co@@ res of the Frag@@ eb@@ ogen@@ s for quality of life at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vit@@ is , dimin@@ ished ap@@ eri@@ us effectively the caused by seasonal Rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal Rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic pri@@ tik@@ aria is re@@ acting for further forms of urine , because the underlying path@@ ology irrespective of the etheric in various forms are similar and chron@@ ous patients might have been clearly prospec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
as the Hist@@ amination of a conden@@ sing factor in all ur@@ tik@@ ari@@ al diseases is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also associated with the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria also in other forms of Ur@@ tic@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic pri@@ tik@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in enhancing pre@@ itus and determination of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin intervals .

an improvement of the ju@@ ri@@ fied by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and the wax is significant , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess this variables .
in a pharmaceutical mac@@ ine@@ tic study , which compared the patients hum@@ o@@ graphi@@ es with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis tempor@@ al , was reached with 4 % of the patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
no cl@@ ue for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzy@@ me has not yet been identified for the met@@ abolic ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine enz@@ ym@@ es , so that interactions with other drugs are not entirely excluded
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 will not be in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ head .

in a clinical @-@ phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ological study was carried out in simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the powerful effects of alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the total incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group like the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials by adults and juven@@ iles in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ori@@ onic pri@@ tik@@ aria , have been reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary study of adults and adolesc@@ ents , who were administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ et@@ ely clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were asked for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ or@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( at the age between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( at the age between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children can be similar to the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults on the children &apos;s population extr@@ ap@@ oli@@ zed .
in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ p@@ ants in adults and juven@@ iles , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied daily for more than 14 days daily , no statistical significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study to adults and you@@ ths , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dosage ) over ten days in adults , showed no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ all .

in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ p@@ ants , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage amount up to 20 mg daily for over 14 days , no statistical significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
at a 30 single @-@ dose study with adults showed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg no influence on standard and measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective stro@@ kes or the tasks that are connected to the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ ev@@ ing symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , Nas@@ en@@ secre@@ tion and Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , itch , irrit@@ ation and red@@ ness of eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate .
in single @-@ dose @-@ cros@@ sover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg mel@@ ting tabl@@ ett with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of lys@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ compatible .
the overall analysis of the pre@@ clinical and clinical trials tests for the mel@@ ting @-@ tabl@@ ett revealed that this wording represents an impro@@ b@@ able risk to local irrit@@ ation in clin@@ ici@@ an application .
the security of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to the children that are normal met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , gl@@ uc@@ ose galvan@@ ization or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suff@@ ic@@ ation of this drug .
the total incidence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
at small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common @-@ lin@@ ens adverse effects reported on the common than in plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fe@@ ver ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , an additional dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution were observed no side @-@ effects in patients aged 6 to 11 years .
for the recommended doses were the pl@@ as@@ ymp@@ ic nucle@@ ations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see in section 5.2 ) to the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials at recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg daily for adults and adolesc@@ ents , no increased incidence of stro@@ kes in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis in dependence on the duration of symptoms were also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and
as shown on the overall result of the Frag@@ eb@@ ogen@@ s for quality of life at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vit@@ is , dimin@@ ished A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the caused by seasonal Rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal Rhin@@ itis .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed phen@@ otyp@@ es was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Kau@@ k@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution to the one contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , there was no bio@@ equi@@ val@@ ant stu@@ ds and it is to be expected that it matches the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various single @-@ osis studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values used by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with the recommended doses were comparable to those of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee on Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ett ( CH@@ MP ) officially unveil@@ ed the company &apos;s application for appro@@ vals from A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 @-@ influ@@ enza amongst adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov ought to be applied in adults and elderly people to protect the flu , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 from the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of flu , which could cause a future cor@@ dem@@ ic .
a influ@@ enza dem@@ ic breaks out when a new trunk of the grip virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have not yet built imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine the immune system recogni@@ zes the immune system the parts of the flu virus as &quot; body alien &quot; and it forms antibodies against it .
due to this , the immune system is later able to form in touch with a grip virus this stem of faster antibodies .
subsequently the membrane envel@@ ope the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recogni@@ zes the human body as a body alien ) , opened up and used as a component of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scale of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA to pre @-@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please refer to the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with human imm@@ en@@ vir@@ al virus from Type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are the acquired Imm@@ une Def@@ iciency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients , who can not swal@@ low the capsules , it may be taken as a solution to the inclusion , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , since the safety of this combination was not studied .
A@@ v@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined , which anti@@ vir@@ al medicines has previously been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has assumed that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken twice daily with twice daily rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines .
for children between four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of al@@ gen@@ ase is aimed at body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , it reduces HIV amount in blood and keeps them at low level .
AIDS not cure AIDS , however , may delay the immune system of immune system and thus also delay the development of HIV infections and diseases .
A@@ v@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , however , without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which had not been treated with the controller previously .
this compared with low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicine A@@ v@@ ase was taken with 206 adults , which had previously been previously prot@@ ector previously , with other proteins .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ evidence concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the vir@@ al last after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had been taken a prototype , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a vir@@ al last to 400 copies / ml than under plac@@ ebo , but stran@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , au@@ re@@ ase also decreased the vir@@ al last but with the children , which were previously treated with the indic@@ tee , only very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults , which had previously been treated with a file , lo@@ wer@@ ed that with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced medicine A@@ v@@ ase the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment are just as effective as other ste@@ ads :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other proteins , it came under A@@ v@@ ase , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the vir@@ al last for four weeks than in the patients carrying out their previous prototype .
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ asis ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , Flat@@ ence ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and f@@ ati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 au@@ re@@ ase may not be applied in patients who might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any other components .
as@@ re@@ ase may not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rant ( herbal remedy for the treatment of depression ) or drugs , which are as well as gen@@ eric medicines and are harmful in high concentr@@ ations in blood health harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV in patients , the A@@ gener@@ asis has to take the risk of a Li@@ al@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ular ( with@@ ering of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ active synchron@@ isation ( symptoms of an infection that are caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee on Human@@ gers ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that the benefits of aspir@@ ant medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of associated with the responsible previously untreated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adult and children over four years compared with the risks .
A@@ v@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fier rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee established that the benefits of A@@ v@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients , which previously did not have been proven any prot@@ ector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ re@@ ase was initially approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there is limited information at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Limited with a permit to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ gen@@ ase throughout the European Union .
A@@ v@@ ase is combined with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ ector ( PI ) subject to adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually , A@@ v@@ ase capsules should be administ@@ ered to pharmac@@ ogen@@ e@@ tic boo@@ sting manufacturing with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ av@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual vir@@ al Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ mu@@ sters and the treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ aci@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the inclusion is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r than Kap@@ sel ; therefore , A@@ zo@@ ase capsules and solution to one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ v@@ ase capsules is 600 mg lor@@ yn@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying add@@ itive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses should be applied to as@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ v@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ nes@@ mg / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmaceutical in@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of ar@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protein ass@@ emblies have not been studied in children .
A@@ v@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ use of data to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic data , dose to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to approximately 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be used in patients with mild or moderate @-@ functioning , in patients with severe liver @-@ functioning it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ re@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicinal products that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing Johann@@ is@@ le ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ mat@@ itis and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ ca@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that as@@ phy@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not result in curing HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including treatment with as@@ ymp@@ ic , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
for usually , aspir@@ ation capsules should be applied along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al dual application therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver inci@@ dents with potentially fatal disease .
for the event of simultaneous anti@@ vir@@ al treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please check the relevant information of these medicines .
patients with existing restrictions , including a chron@@ ically @-@ active h@@ epatitis show an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ v@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other gl@@ uc@@ ci@@ oids , which are confused about CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment reduces the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical vi@@ als including morph@@ ing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the fuel @-@ changing of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or lov@@ ingly strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , will not be recommended for simultaneous administration of aspir@@ ation with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen .
4 For some medications , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation Rati@@ o ) are available methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
in patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ v@@ ase may be less effective because of the so @-@ called pl@@ us@@ al seal of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ avi@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium issue symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered .
because of the potential risk of risk of tox@@ icity due to high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ s , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four years and should be applied to caution with certain other patients .
A@@ v@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients suffering from anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including prototype , has been reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases which were needed in their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , like a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders , associated with
with h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with a controller , there are reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and ha@@ emat@@ o@@ arthritis before .
at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammat@@ ory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical trials or deteri@@ oration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fact@@ orial Ae@@ ge@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ tico @-@ repression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term waste of an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al @-@ therapy ( ART ) .
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low diagnostic width A@@ v@@ ase must not simultaneously be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which have a small therapeutic width and also present sub@@ str@@ ates of cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ v@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals , whose active ingredients are predomin@@ antly connected via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated for increased pl@@ asma @-@ bri@@ cks with severe and / or life @-@ threatening effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to put the hum@@ ili@@ ous pl@@ asma @-@ cell through a tin increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were observed very frequently unwanted effects on the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ spiegel of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be de@@ hum@@ bled by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already includes cur@@ rant , the am@@ us@@ al levels are and , if possible to review the vir@@ al load and liber@@ ate the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not necessary when Nel@@ um@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max , against 30 % hum@@ ili@@ ated if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg are used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that en@@ closures the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this treatment procedures .
52 % low , if Am@@ am@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min values by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) were reached twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a met@@ ering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a narrow machine monitoring because the effectiveness and ir@@ regul@@ arity of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ological study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , is recommended due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenue from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ v@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in case of gift from E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with am@@ nes@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) do not require a dosage adjustment .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ eg@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ect@@ asis was reduced .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ ector and existing data suggests that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the ser@@ um centr@@ ation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r might be sen@@ kt .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the decreased / or possibly sub@@ therapeutic pl@@ asma .
when these medicines will be applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be performed , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ bl@@ av@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is tricky on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ y@@ av@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in the pl@@ as@@ le@@ on@@ center ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in around 193 % and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in side effects .
if it is needed for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to achieve a reduction in dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dosage although there are no clinical data .
pharmaceutical research in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted , but the pl@@ asma @-@ cell of both medicinal products could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ ca@@ vi@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in increasing the C@@ max of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily with a comparison to 200 mg of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , in@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with aspir@@ ation may possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored on tox@@ icity reactions that are connected to these drugs once they are applied in combination with aspir@@ ation .
based on the data of other prot@@ ector , it is advis@@ able that the ant@@ acid cannot be taken at the same time as as@@ re@@ ase , as it can be res@@ or@@ atory disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , which are known as an enzy@@ me ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of pl@@ asma @-@ cell .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ at@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ ew@@ pin , Ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and los@@ am@@ il may be increased 10 by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
the simultaneous intake with as@@ phy@@ ase can increase sperm and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules are performed twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days at Pro@@ b@@ anden , dropped out by approximately 86 % ( 90 % con@@ cluding intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ asis will not be advised along with these gl@@ uc@@ tik@@ ids along with these gl@@ uc@@ tik@@ ero@@ ids , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment is associated to the risk of system@@ ic Cor@@ tik@@ ost@@ ero@@ y effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose fuel altern@@ ation strongly depends on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect increasing pl@@ asma angles in simultaneous administration of ano@@ pro@@ ase .
da Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ enh@@ ances this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opath@@ y including a rh@@ ub@@ omet@@ ar can lead , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it will be a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations up to the stabili@@ zation of the mirror , because the pl@@ asma @-@ concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can be increased in a simultaneous gift of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ v@@ ase should not be applied together with or@@ ally f@@ lown Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while being offered with par@@ mes@@ an with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with caution .
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors to a possible increase in pl@@ asma @-@ bri@@ cks of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ on administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore observe symptoms in op@@ ium symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administ@@ ered .
because of the per se minor read@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons , cannot be given any recommendation as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be shi@@ fted , if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in a simultaneous display of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ b@@ ans combined with A@@ gener@@ acy , the enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ar@@ otic ratio is recommended , because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ otic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contradiction is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption is recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example &apos; Desi@@ re@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in a current gift of as@@ ymp@@ ic ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy , after careful checked of potential uses for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for fet@@ us .

a re@@ fraction of pregnant R@@ att@@ as , which was administ@@ ered by the ni@@ rest@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lact@@ ation period , shown during the lact@@ ation period showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight .
the further development of offspring including Fer@@ ti@@ lit@@ es and repeat@@ ability was not affected by the administration of both am@@ ass@@ ar and the mother @-@ animal .
the simil@@ arity of A@@ v@@ ase has been studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase inhibit@@ or were slightly to moderate , they appeared early and rarely resulted in the treatment .
many of these events is not clar@@ ified whether they are related to the intake of as@@ phy@@ ase or any other at the same time regarding HIV treatment &apos;s disease , or whether they are a result of the disease infection .
most of the listed side effects are taken from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , where with a release partial , patients 1200 mg A@@ v@@ ase twice daily received .

the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data and it is recommended to attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations for analysis of the results of Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ sters .
at ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analysis blade systems in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ nes@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
companies , the diagnostic test tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al Cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which may be applied to the interpretation of results of a Resi@@ st@@ al tests .
each of these four with a decreased pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity against am@@ on@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ative pattern creates a certain crus@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resist@@ ence between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other ste@@ ad@@ jun@@ ctions for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ sus@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously untreated patients , in which a fossil @-@ resistance against L@@ opin@@ zin@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Co@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against several other prot@@ ector @-@ resistant insulation ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early da@@ w@@ ning of a reconc@@ iled therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the following treatment .
the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily basis is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised person ( vir@@ al membrane ) . ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with the low@@ do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , &quot; received .
six@@ ty @-@ thir@@ teen @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to as@@ phy@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis introduced the non @-@ sub@@ embar@@ ras@@ sment of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in relation to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the virus @-@ last ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the pl@@ asma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ press shaft of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ b@@ oo@@ st@@ em@@ powered au@@ re@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were assigned with PI .
in the studies , A@@ zo@@ ase solution has been used in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI patients had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study included in the study included a pl@@ asma cutting level &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the starting point .
19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered for the treatment @-@ optim@@ ised children of the expected children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ native &quot; ano@@ pro@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max was reduced by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % lo@@ wering of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ ain@@ able 12 hours to serv@@ ings ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration stayed in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) from the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is influenced by the scale and rate of the Res@@ cue .
the seem@@ ing volume of distribution is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and makes up a large distribution volume , as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation out of the blood circulation .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in pl@@ asma , whereby the amount of un@@ inj@@ un@@ equ@@ ated am@@ us@@ al , represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ expect@@ ancy remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the loss intervals , depending on the overall drug Con@@ centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state power over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min .
therefore , medicines that in@@ ject CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ cis@@ ed or im@@ b@@ ate or sub@@ str@@ ate or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which can be administ@@ ered with caution when they are simultaneously given by an@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ ate exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ am@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules , therefore , A@@ zo@@ ase solution and aspir@@ ation capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able at a milli@@ grams .
even the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore , it should be the impact of kidney @-@ functioning upon the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ eg@@ s similar to those who are at healthy pro@@ b@@ anden after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ nes@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on ju@@ ri@@ ogen@@ s by mice and rats occurred at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome in doses , that said to the 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , escap@@ ed .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular hy@@ den@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been un@@ solved , and the relevance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on people , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genital tests , the bacterial infection tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ omes , was not mut@@ at@@ ched neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity may be observed and proven in clinical life by means of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate .
so far in clinical trials , no significant Leb@@ er@@ tox@@ icity in patients have been observed , neither during administration of as@@ phy@@ ase still after the treatment of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , who were treated with an age of 4 days showed great mort@@ ality as well as with counter@@ parts .
in a system@@ ic pl@@ asma position , the significant among ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage when humans lay , however , have been observed a number of minor changes including Th@@ y@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ elet@@ on changes that are reli@@ ed on a del@@ ayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying add@@ itive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses should be applied to as@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ v@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ nes@@ mg / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be used in patients with watch@@ ful or more liver @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , in patients with severe liver @-@ functioning it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation Rati@@ o ) are available methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
A@@ v@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in the duration of 27 when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max , against 30 % hum@@ ili@@ ated if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min values by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) were reached twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg ) lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a met@@ ering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , there will be a narrow machine monitoring because the effectiveness and ir@@ regul@@ arity of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ eg@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ect@@ asis was reduced .
when these medicines will be applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical supervision should be performed , since a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ bl@@ av@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is tricky on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase is required to achieve a reduction in dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in to at least half of the recommended dosage 31 , although there are no clinical data .
the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium channels such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ at@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , Ni@@ ew@@ pin , Ni@@ pp@@ di@@ pin , Nim@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and los@@ am@@ il may be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules are performed twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days at Pro@@ b@@ anden , dropped out by approximately 86 % ( 90 % con@@ cluding intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
in a simultaneous display of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ b@@ ans combined with A@@ gener@@ acy , the enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Stand@@ ar@@ otic ratio is recommended , because of the possibility of a we@@ aker or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ otic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % in bz@@ w .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy , after careful checked of potential uses for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ fraction of pregnant R@@ att@@ as , which was administ@@ ered by the ni@@ rest@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lact@@ ation period , shown during the lact@@ ation period showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight .
the simil@@ arity of A@@ v@@ ase has been studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
in the case of over@@ dose the patient is to observe any signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary are necessary support measures .
the anti@@ vir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ an cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral S@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ at@@ es@@ cent@@ age ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ yn@@ avi@@ r is found in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute cells and is 505 µ@@ mo@@ t in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ m = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against several other prot@@ ector @-@ resistant insulation ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , treatment @-@ optim@@ isation should be taken into consideration when treatment @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ native &quot; ano@@ pro@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ expect@@ ancy remains constant , the percentage of free active components during the loss intervals , depending on the overall drug Con@@ centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state power over the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min .
therefore , medicines that in@@ ject CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ cis@@ ed or im@@ b@@ ate or sub@@ str@@ ate or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which can be administ@@ ered with caution when they are simultaneously given by an@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
even the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore it should be the impact of kidney @-@ functioning upon the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on ju@@ ri@@ ogen@@ s by mice and rats occurred at male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne h@@ epat@@ oc@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome in doses , that said to the 2,@@ 0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ oc@@ y@@ ule ar@@ den@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is un@@ clear .
however , from the present ex@@ position data on people , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genital tests , the bacterial infection tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome blades of human periph@@ eral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes @-@ contained , was not mut@@ at@@ ile or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically .
studies on tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , who were treated with an age of 4 days showed great mort@@ ality as well as with counter@@ parts .
these results can be conclude that the met@@ abolic path@@ ways are not yet fully eradic@@ ated , so am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation .
A@@ v@@ ase solution to take is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ector ( PI ) subject to adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; mon@@ ob@@ ase &quot; solution has not been paid to patients and are not previously paid to the patient &apos;s approval in the subject untreated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ aci@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the inclusion is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r than Kap@@ sel ; therefore , A@@ zo@@ ase capsules and solution to one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to the One ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ v@@ ase solution is 17 mg . ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines , up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , since there is no intake recommendation for the simultaneous application of the macro @-@ v@@ ase solution to the inclusion and low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided as a combination of these patients .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for it , an application of as@@ phy@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic substances as a result of high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ ster@@ al@@ ts , an au@@ re@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women in patients with reduced mobility function or liver scre@@ ens and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous employment can lead to a competent im@@ itation of the met@@ abolic zation of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that as@@ phy@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy does not result in curing HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy , including treatment with as@@ ymp@@ ic , does not prevent the risk of zero transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .

A@@ v@@ ase should be dis@@ continued during the duration when a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug - 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
with h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with a controller , there are reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and ha@@ emat@@ o@@ arthritis before .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .

the cream is adjustable before bed@@ time di@@ ge@@ on@@ ically to the affected skin areas so that they remains enough for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dara was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredients ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area of 16 weeks .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete rep@@ lication of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara is also examined in two trials in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dara or the plac@@ ebo either per day or five times a week .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete de@@ division of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara is also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with ak@@ tin@@ cal ker@@ at@@ ins .
in all studies , Al@@ dara is more effective than the plac@@ ebo in all four main studies 15 % to 52 % in patients with Al@@ dara patients , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with un@@ dara patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .

in other studies where no daily pre@@ faces were carried out , two cases of severe ph@@ im@@ osis and a case with one to circum@@ cis@@ ion has been observed .
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk for heavy local co@@ atings ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , by proper application , heavy local co@@ atings have been observed , which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical imp@@ air@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occur at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which made a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .

limited data suggests an increased rate of war@@ nings from HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in this patient population in relation to the elimination of the co@@ war@@ ts , however , showed a lower effectiveness .
the treatment of the Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line has not been studied .
local bar@@ racks are common , but the intensity of this reactions occur in general during therapy or the reactions form after completing the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local mental actions , a treatment course can be done by several days .
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the re@@ conditioning of the untreated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment of the treatment .
there are currently no data relating to long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after the treatment should be considered to be considered to be considered to be super@@ vised Bas@@ al@@ cell@@ ar@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ r@@ ative and previously untreated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in previously untreated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) is a lesser degree of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of tin@@ cal ker@@ at@@ ins on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the Lipp@@ en@@ r@@ ots .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of tin@@ cal ker@@ at@@ ts in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the cal ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application form , therefore an application is not recommended .
local trans@@ itional actions frequently occur , but these reactions normally take in the course of therapy from intensity or go back after de@@ compos@@ ing the therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream .
if local skin reactions tend to cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for some days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons are considered a lower complete cure of therapy than patients with fewer than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .

in the study the security of the drug was examined ; however , it has also measured its effectiveness ( by having its effect in relation to reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations tested in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me concentr@@ ating in the Ur@@ in of about 60 % , and half of the trad@@ ed children reported a normal liver in the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain @-@ pain , rash , pain , pain in the extrem@@ ities ( in hands and feet ) , Hit@@ ze@@ ep , fe@@ ver and reactions to the infection site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , Tach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( acceler@@ ated heart rate ) , fe@@ ver and sh@@ aking fro@@ st .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may seem sever@@ ely sensitive ( allergic ) on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , cannot be applied .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be posted every year for all new information that may be announced , and we will update this summary ( if applicable ) .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is obtained patients who are Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me amo@@ unting to the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the European Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe BV to appro@@ ve approval of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human@@ ic α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using the use of Ch@@ o @-@ Mamm@@ als ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is a long @-@ time enzy@@ me treatment in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ d@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase inhibit@@ ors ) indi@@ ces to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary substance disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be if the patient gets rid of it , every 15 minutes in single ro@@ duction to a maximum measurement by 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 has not been fixed , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ des has not been determined and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop inf@@ usion @-@ borne reactions , which are defined as any standing side effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ anti@@ thesis ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored by eng@@ aging and inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be at disposal only in a reasonable clinical setting , in the re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies will be available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 @-@ study , it is expected to constitute almost all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infection @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections , 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
given a little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer break , must be careful due to the theoretically possible risk response after a break in treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential potential of infection @-@ related reactions .
in the case of an easy or medium @-@ sized infection @-@ conditioned response , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ am@@ ac@@ ic / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion reaction , the inf@@ usion must be hal@@ ted until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ o@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ ac@@ cre@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is weak@@ ened .
inf@@ usion can be applied with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion in which the reaction occurred again .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ am@@ ic@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion in which the prescribed reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
veter@@ an studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not to breast@@ feed .
side effects in clinical trials were predomin@@ antly defined as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 @-@ study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( length of treatment up to 1 year ) .
unwanted research reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3@@ - study and their extension to a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table after the following orders : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ct @-@ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of upper respir@@ atory and lungs in pre @-@ history , a severe reaction came to , including bronze , respir@@ atory and facial fill@@ ings ( see section 4.4 ) .
children &apos;s unwanted drug inter@@ depen@@ dencies in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported in a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe form of dis@@ ruption and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
during most patients there was a ser@@ um trial within 3 months after starting treatment for a ser@@ tation ( average of 5 days compared to a ser@@ p@@ ative release ( average of 26 days compared to 45 days for patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 @-@ study ( or up to a premature outlet from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients by radio immune pro@@ cip@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say ver@@ able antibodies against , among which 3 patients had never come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ versions .
patients with fault @-@ up to lower body mirror reported a robust reduction in the G@@ AG Spi@@ der in Har@@ n , while in patients with high anti@@ body tit@@ ers to determine a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low NEU@@ TRA@@ LI@@ ZZ@@ AN@@ ING activity in vit@@ ro that appeared to inter@@ f@@ ere clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable pharmaceutical campaigns , even if the appearance of undes@@ irable development interactions typically developed with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzy@@ me treatment is in one for the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ ys@@ se of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzy@@ vity .
after intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and recorded by cells into the l@@ ymph@@ omas , most likely about cre@@ osis @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients have been recru@@ ited for the study , the entire disease spectrum was reported , the majority of patients struck by the medium @-@ sized phen@@ otyp@@ e and only a patient proved a severe phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an acceler@@ ated loan volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute side track in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label renewal programs , where they received another 3,5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks therapy the patients were treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me as compared to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement in the lung function and the ability to display in the table below .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not statist@@ ically significant over this period of clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased proportional to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ on treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal live @-@ size .
within the first 4 weeks a marked drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established until the degree of study is fixed .
regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ ic disease period between the patients who comp@@ lied with the use of a combined object , the clin@@ ically significant norm@@ ales FE@@ V , Section in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , movement area of the Schul@@ ter@@ gel@@ en@@ ks A@@ HI and t@@ end@@ action ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it was conducted a one @-@ year @-@ round open phase 2 , primarily the security and Pharmac@@ ology from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy duty form and 4 with the medium run shape ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to hei@@ gh@@ tened G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth was growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) observed after the Z @-@ Score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium run @-@ form ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium run @-@ form are limited only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study research on pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ met@@ ering schem@@ ata on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel are performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the Leb@@ er@@ volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dosage ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 e / kg of intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the met@@ ering scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may have difficulties in patients who present difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , however , is not proved that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the pharmaceutical may be updated .
pharmac@@ ological profile in patients in the age of 5 was similar to older and less affected patients .

after recovery , patients must be treated according to the references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria follow the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) Why C@@ TC level 2 ble@@ eding .
if patients don &apos;t develop @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity high degree 3 ( except Neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value before the treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be cancelled , if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ mic tox@@ icity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity degrees 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continues during the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies revealed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 Jah@@ n or in addition to patients compared to 65 years old , a increased by @-@ risk minim@@ ization .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , in patients with a credit @-@ in clearing plant , were necessary for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing plant , which should be recommended over all patients recommended for all patients recommended .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients were examined by a liver in@@ cis@@ ment of &gt; the 1.5 times of the upper lim@@ ili@@ ru@@ by @-@ bound@@ less and / or trans@@ amin@@ im@@ en@@ value of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 times of the upper limit value ( at the presence of Leb@@ er@@ metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( for presence of liver @-@ metastatic ) not especially studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ red@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ . come back to a value of 7@@ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ rom@@ at @-@ number returns a value of bi @-@ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ number , Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ t@@ esis and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a decreased tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 mat@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ae@@ ological tox@@ icity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie has been observed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be instruc@@ ted to rely on fo@@ lic acid , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for action @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ ach@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ ates ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ ce@@ - avoid 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients needed for a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required , intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ term for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , prec@@ eding high blood pressure or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid flu@@ ids , accumulation in the trans @-@ cell@@ ular space will be a dra@@ inage of the ergonom@@ ic flow before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ nation attack , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ical substance .
for this reason the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ated life @-@ consuming ( except yellow fe@@ ver , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ versible skull due to reproductive @-@ ability made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised in front of the treatment - g@@ can be advised to obtain advice regarding the sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing stand ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high doses ( 3@@ 1,3 g daily ) to lead to a decreased tick @-@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ ly re@@ occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance * 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high dosage .

since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ term as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ lics have to be avoided for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - to be avoided .
the big in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of straight@@ forwar@@ ding status during the illness and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ b@@ icide and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy ) requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation Rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed during pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ esth@@ ood are anticipated when used in pregnancy severe birth defects .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely exhau@@ sti@@ ble and after careful dism@@ ant@@ ling of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ versible damage of the reproductive @-@ ability is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised prior to the treatment course of the treatment , consultation with regards to the sperm flo@@ cks .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to the mother &apos;s milk passes and unwanted effects on the car@@ eless inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .

experience for the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies occur not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered to be treated by the doctor &apos;s doctor .
in clinical trials , most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who at least possibly with alo@@ xi in the context were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and shelter ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive actions and reactions on agreements ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing report reviews .
in the group with the highest doses showed similar frequency of unwanted events as in the other met@@ ering groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were not performed , due to the large distribution of distribution , however , is probably not an effective therapy for a Alo@@ ha over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies , 3.1 mg / m2 Cis@@ plat@@ in , Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) received , which was given on day 1 without the dex@@ ame@@ th@@ one intraven@@ ous case .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind stu@@ ds became a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly incre@@ mental chemotherapy with over 60 mg / m2 of Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , compared with patients who were given 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given on day 1 intraven@@ ous .
results of the studies with moderate em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy is summar@@ ised in the tables below .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced sick@@ ness and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the inv@@ ented clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the icon of the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation involved and extend the duration of action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy respon@@ dents was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ V. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ osen from 0.25 , 0,75 and 2,25 mg .
Res@@ ol@@ ation After intraven@@ ous G@@ abe , following a slow@@ ing decrease of Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ations a slow ri@@ mination from the body with an average @-@ termin@@ al half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum pl@@ as@@ pi@@ on@@ center ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentr@@ ations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally applied in the entire dosage range from 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ in / kg with healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 68@@ mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the middle of 11 high temperature car@@ cin@@ ations between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mat@@ on@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic sim@@ ulations goes out that the overall intraven@@ ous form of 0,25 mg of palm oil ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached with that after non @-@ recur@@ ring reci@@ proc@@ al administration of 0,75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ max was according to the single delivery of 0,75 mg higher .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic disorders that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron via less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on met@@ abolic mechanisms have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in low dimensions , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in Met@@ abol@@ ism by Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination of a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ e@@ tical object , overall body @-@ clear@@ ance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing period 53 ± 29 ml / min .
though , in patients with severe liver @-@ functioning , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ g and the average system@@ ic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , a reduction in the dose is therefore un@@ justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that may be considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a small relevance to the clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical trials , evidence points out that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentration of concentr@@ ations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and rep@@ lic@@ ari@@ zation and can pro@@ long the shareholders .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose which was given in about the triple of therapeutic exposure to men ) which were given every day over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver cir@@ cl@@ os , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , pan@@ cre@@ as , however not with mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the high doses and since alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low as for the human being .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ it@@ arian Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative assessment , in which the author@@ ization of approval for the transport@@ ation of the treatment of h@@ epatitis C is recommended for electr@@ o 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon is similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same practices that has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference rate &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( one caused by a vir@@ al infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver cir@@ rh@@ osis indicates damages , in addition , the values of the Leb@@ er@@ enz@@ ms Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increased in blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which resulted in the formation of the substance .
the producer of Alph@@ eon provided data that occupy the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredients , composition and pur@@ ity of the medication , drugs , safety and effectiveness of h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study to patients with h@@ epatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared to 455 patients .
the study has been measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 therapy sessions as well as 6 months after in@@ appro@@ ve of the treatment to the drug said ( i.e. no sign of the virus is referred to in the blood ) .

furthermore there have been argu@@ ing that the data for the stability of the drug and the ban on drugs should not be eliminated .
the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C , which spoke to treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon , the disease affected more patients than with the reference rate ; also al@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the study carried out in the study to examine the question , how much the drug im@@ poses a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it may be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ acking @-@ going skin infection ) and small in@@ identified in@@ pag@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ or or mou@@ ld@@ ings ) , de@@ dic@@ ed and paraly@@ sed wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , which may be trac@@ eable or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resist@@ ent For@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go against these kinds of infections might not affect .
al@@ tar@@ go may be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but for patients under 18 years old can not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient has not responded to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) , and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
the main indic@@ ator of effectiveness was described in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was diver@@ ted towards the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2,@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients among plac@@ ebo talked to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ wo@@ unds , al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ alex@@ in similar contact : if the results of both studies were regarded in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups to treatment .
in these two studies , however , were discovered that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of wast@@ eland ( the crowded cav@@ ities in the body tissues ) or from infections , which may be proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the door .
the Committee on Human@@ gers ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go after the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • in@@ verse little la@@ under@@ es , dis@@ ables or gen@@ res wo@@ unds .
in May 2007 the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for appro@@ ch@@ ement of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients , which are not counting on improvement within two or three days , should be examined once more and an alternative therapy will be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensiti@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be canc@@ eled , the ano@@ int@@ ment carefully ab@@ used and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection are started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be applied to treat infections , with which MR@@ SA is known as Er@@ re@@ ger or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary and open wound , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in resist@@ ent For@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , un@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or a deteri@@ oration of the infected .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicine is not recommended .
due to the small pl@@ asma @-@ centric , which were reached by humans after top@@ ical application on a dic@@ ed skin or infected superf@@ icial che@@ ological , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition were not expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous or@@ ant gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be to scr@@ ap@@ ed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tions are not considered necessary if desktop ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ fr@@ acti@@ onal icity after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are inadequate in regard to a statement on the birth and the federal al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indi@@ gest@@ ed and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ ably prefer@@ able to the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / stop or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go continues / completed is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the tar@@ n@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , al@@ tar@@ go was applied the most commonly reported side @-@ effect of irrit@@ ation on appointments , which consider approximately 1 % of the patients .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthe@@ tic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance caused by fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) isolated .
the mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on sel@@ ective met@@ ering of bacterial proteins by interaction with a particular bond point of the 50 sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the bond of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the li@@ aison officer ri@@ f@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ f@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bond and of the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ fire .
by attachment to this binding head@@ line P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block some P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units .
should be listed due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some inf@@ ec@@ ular forms , a consultation by experts should be pursued .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the ins@@ ulin were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ speaking on the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us the presence of tribes should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was produced daily under Oc@@ clusi@@ on at intact and de@@ ported skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary medical wo@@ unds , individual pl@@ asma were won .
the sam@@ pling was carried out by days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the previous application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic inclusion in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be was s@@ ap@@ ed on 200 c@@ m2 / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The met@@ abolic met@@ abolic met@@ abolic disorders by Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human life @-@ mic@@ ron@@ ome was primarily taught by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low involvement of CY@@ P2@@ C8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive g@@ us@@ er- and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .

Ambi@@ rix is intended for protection against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases that apply the liver ) in children between the ages of one and 15 that are still not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied in one of two doses of the current vaccines , whereby protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix not only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of HC@@ V infection and ensures that the influ@@ x of two doses can be led to the end of the vaccine .
if a refres@@ her dose is required for h@@ epatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other h@@ epatitis C or -@@ B vaccine would be given .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ in@@ ous vaccine Twin@@ rix &apos; Children and the since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix Children .
the three vaccines can be applied to protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ Cit@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Children are administ@@ ered as part of one of three doses of the current vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults identical ingredients include , some of the data included the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix carried out between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of the development of antibodies against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix starts at a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , pi@@ et@@ it@@ man@@ gel , pain on the inj@@ ecting site , red@@ ness , mat@@ ography ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be sensitive in patients who may not be sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) not to be applied .
August 2002 divided the European Commission to the firm Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire
the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation for the pri@@ mer cr@@ iti@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of choice and the second dose is administ@@ ered for the first dose of 6 and 12 months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B can be vacc@@ inated , vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccine .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) observed after a pri@@ mer anti @-@ h@@ epatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A @-@ virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
it is still not fully backed up to whether immun@@ o@@ capable people re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ed to a h@@ epatitis C vaccine , a refres@@ hing vacc@@ ination should be prot@@ ru@@ ined than protection , since they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As for all inj@@ ections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine . appropriate methods of medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately .
if a faster protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended by the drop @-@ inj@@ ectable h@@ epatitis A @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface area .
in hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis patient and individuals with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , under circumstances no adequate anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ ho@@ bs income is reached , so in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be required .
since a intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimum fitting success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in case of Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie or cons@@ ular disorders , Ambi@@ rix is subject to sub@@ ordin@@ ated sub@@ cut@@ aneous , since it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift .
if Ambi@@ rix starts in the second year of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ ä@@ rem Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated pol@@ om@@ yel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mask @-@ tube vaccine was administ@@ ered to all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients under immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with patients with immune def@@ effects must be understood that there will be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical trial involving 3 vacc@@ ination of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , head@@ aches , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver comparable to the frequency that was observed at the former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ hal@@ ved vaccine .
in clinical trial 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administ@@ ered in a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 and 15 , after 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix is compared with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant formula .
only exceptions were the higher incidence of pain and matches on a calculation basis for a vacc@@ ination . however , not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix by 5@@ 0,7 % of the Pro@@ b@@ anden , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the pro@@ ving after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
after the whole vaccine reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the pro@@ b@@ anden , which had received its ambi@@ ance , about pain , compared with 6@@ 3.8 % at the subjects , which have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose .
the frequency of matches was however equivalent to a Pro@@ band ( i.e. , over the entire vaccine ) at 39.@@ 6 % of the pro@@ b@@ anden , which received its ambi@@ ental , compared with 36.@@ 2 % at the subjects that got the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ ant cav@@ ity .
the frequency of pre@@ valence and mat@@ icity was low and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combin@@ ant formula with the 3 @-@ doses of the vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines the occurrence of local actions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ con@@ genital h@@ epatitis A @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface area .

the share of vaccines that have severe adverse reactions during the 2 @-@ doses of vaccines with ambi@@ ental or during the 3 @-@ doses of vaccines with the Advanced h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis C patients , was statist@@ ically different .
in clinical trials , which were conducted at vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 , the Ser@@ o@@ con@@ dens@@ ation rates for Anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % per month after the first dose and 100 % per month after the second , to the month 6 .
the Ser@@ o@@ ver@@ sion@@ ary rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % per month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 to the month 6 .
7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was conducted at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old , we received 2 cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined with three doses .
among the 28@@ 9 people whose imm@@ unity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ation rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ tin compounds significantly higher than with ambi@@ rix .
the immun@@ ology , which have been reached in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - up to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after ending the full vacc@@ inations ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the next table .
in both studies the vaccines can be either a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ ental or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ shaped h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ B @-@ surface anti@@ gen .
individuals who were at the time of pri@@ mer ari@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ ho@@ bs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccines .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that which resulted in vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combined harmon@@ isation , consisting of 360 ELISA @-@ entities , a pre @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface area in a dose @-@ capacity of 0.5 ml .

you can feel very tired , have a dark ones , a bl@@ ending face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow ) and other symptoms which may need a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines it may not completely protect against an infection with h@@ epatitis C or h@@ epatitis B virus , although the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 cans .
if you are infected / your child prior to administration of both vacc@@ ination or h@@ epatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not yet feel uncomfortable or feel ill / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections , which causes the liver or cause symptoms which are similar to those following a h@@ epatitis C or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be taught .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including the N@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can have an allergic reaction , breathing or an@@ chor@@ age of the face or tongue appeal . • if you have already performed an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • if you have a serious infection with fe@@ ver .
• If you want to have a quick protection against h@@ epatitis B ( that is , within six months and prior to the proposed administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
when a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will tell you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with ambi@@ ental .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined epatitis B / h@@ epatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA @-@ units of a formal h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B @-@ surface form ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine against end the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix starts with individuals who suffer from severe hem@@ or@@ an@@ emia disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle po@@ pri@@ ght . • if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your / its body @-@ condition or if you / your child is under@@ taking a look .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people to vacc@@ ination cannot be adequate so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction is on the vacc@@ ination .
21 S@@ agen to your doctor if you take / your child additional medicines / takes ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have received your child recently vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received / or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response is not adequate to the vaccine and therefore the person is not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated as separate places as possible as possible as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix starts at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women is not administ@@ ered unless there is urgent need to vacc@@ inated against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange an appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been well @-@ known since issu@@ ing of the first permit for the operator , represented the CH@@ MP opinion that remains the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix which remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix is only limited in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicinal product is limited to the low patient position .
Ammon@@ ite may also be employed with patients at the age of over a month with in@@ compatible enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain function as a result of high ammon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre @-@ history .
Ammon@@ ap shall - split into several single tro@@ users to meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food mixed or via a gast@@ ro@@ dental clinic ( through the abdom@@ inal blan@@ ket into the stomach of leading tube ) or a n@@ as@@ ur@@ onde ( by the nose in the stomach of the tube ) administ@@ ered .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , as Ammon@@ ite may not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ light ament , that is to be compared without any substance ) .
Ammon@@ ite may also lead to app@@ ell@@ it@@ loss , a ab@@ normal cleans@@ ing in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , impotence , supplements or taste , v@@ stomach , mat@@ ing , rash , rash , rash , or weight gain .
the Committee on Human@@ gers ( CH@@ MP ) stim@@ ulated an end to the conclusion that Ammon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary tract can be effectively prevented .
Ammon@@ ite has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval limited information about this medicine .
the application is inde@@ xed to all patients , in which a complete enc@@ ro@@ de has already manifest@@ ed in Neu@@ geb@@ o@@ alter ( within the first 28 Leb@@ enst@@ age ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete enc@@ ym@@ bone , which man@@ if@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) there is an indication for the use when in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ coher@@ ent enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated by taking into account the protein toler@@ ances and the necessary daily protein intake .
after the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an early realization of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthe@@ tic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bin@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ex @-@ synthe@@ tic synthe@@ tic def@@ ect should be given arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered with dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia because there is a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ ul@@ a if the tablets are not able to go into the stomach .
every pill AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be applied in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure and in@@ suff@@ r@@ ations , as well as with so@@ dium int@@ enti@@ veness and oil @-@ supp@@ ression states only with caution .
since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ary about the liver and kid@@ neys often occurs , AM@@ MONA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure should be applied only with extreme caution .
the meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ ing of the neur@@ onal re@@ ation and a stri@@ ped loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a del@@ ayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of zer@@ eb@@ r@@ als syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in humans into the milk milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during lact@@ ation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical attempts with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events came out of it that they were not related to AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old female patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y , anti @-@ cy@@ to@@ pen@@ al , periph@@ er@@ ent neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
the case of an over@@ dose came with a five months old to@@ d@@ dler with a wat@@ ering sli@@ ding of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl acet@@ ate , which showed a dose of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day of a dos@@ cop@@ tic neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection , which is controlled by acet@@ ate with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is passed on via the kid@@ neys .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of over@@ throwing nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ th@@ ec@@ y@@ cle can be assumed that for each gramm@@ s of so@@ dium int@@ ran@@ ate between 0,12 mm and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen is produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chance of survival and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the earliest manifest@@ ations of the condition was almost always inf@@ ar@@ ist , and the disease attributed himself to treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or having their stu@@ ff@@ inal an@@ alogy within the first life year .
by hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative means of nit@@ rogen effect ( so@@ dium poly@@ phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ reduced r@@ ust and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival of new medicines at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed in 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y , but even with these patients there was time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the illness ( including feminine patients with the h@@ et@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ ene form des Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bin@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rates were 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly re@@ versible for treatment and in some patients can occur another deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ vul@@ ged in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disorders within pl@@ asma and urine were measured according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g so@@ dium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ary , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after ass@@ essm@@ ents as well as repet@@ itive gifts from or@@ alen doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disorders was also investigated with cancer victims of so@@ dium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablets were determined 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable pl@@ as@@ ure@@ tic generated by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ th@@ rot@@ ary disorders or hem@@ op@@ ae@@ ology , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after nä@@ s at the pl@@ asma , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in pl@@ asma .
at three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with so@@ dium bis@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single d@@ are ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations at pl@@ asma @-@ commerce the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the kon@@ ju@@ gi@@ fted product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test had to take N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses of tox@@ icity ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who can still swal@@ low tablets , or patients with dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ sion compounds .
after the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly un@@ bran@@ ched amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ ectors in pl@@ asma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early realization of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthe@@ tic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bin@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0,@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg . ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium poly@@ but@@ ary , accordingly 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium poly@@ but@@ ary , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when en@@ atten@@ u@@ ties had been exposed to the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of brain cancer .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old female patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y , anti @-@ cy@@ to@@ pen@@ al , periph@@ er@@ ent neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
Stö@@ chi@@ omet@@ ric is seen Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ th@@ ec@@ y@@ cle can be assumed that for each gramm@@ es of so@@ dium dietary fib@@ yr@@ s between 0,12 mm and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen is produced .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly re@@ versible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were observed 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable pl@@ as@@ ure@@ tic generated by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the ready product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on sk@@ unk , the middle measurement of 2.@@ 9 g and the big spo@@ on 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium py@@ ri@@ but@@ ary .
if a patient has to get the drug over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dis@@ solved before use in water ( sol@@ v@@ itation of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enz@@ ym@@ es are missing , so they are the stu@@ ff@@ inal waste products which can accum@@ ulate in the consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at results can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you take AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken before , even if it is not prescription drug .
during lact@@ ation , you must not take AM@@ MONA@@ CO@@ PS since the drug could result in breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion have also been confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , dis@@ appearance of hearing , dis@@ appearance , re@@ membran@@ ce and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , you immediately get in touch with your doctor or with the emergency position of your hospital , the introduction of appropriate treatment in connection .

An@@ gi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or M@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ ants ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or E@@ KG ) .
will An@@ gi@@ ox to prevent cl@@ ots in patients being applied to a PCI , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help with patients with Ang@@ ina or cardi@@ ac arr@@ ho@@ ea to maintain blood flow towards the heart and increase the effectiveness of PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all of the gift , or in connection with a Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine to prevent cl@@ ots ) with h@@ ep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ) and a G@@ PI was compared .
while PCI was often used to patients a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which ab@@ ides in the arter@@ ies ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots off , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac attacks or Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year in total as conventional treatment .
in patients who subj@@ ected themselves to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators just as h@@ ep@@ arin , except for heavy ble@@ eding when it was significantly more effective than h@@ ep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other sh@@ ud@@ age or any other components .
in addition , it must not be applied in patients who reported recently a ble@@ eding , as well as with people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee on Human@@ gers ( CH@@ MP ) approved the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is active in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ eh@@ el@@ ar@@ er replacement for h@@ ep@@ arin .
September 2004 , the European Commission divided the European Commission to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a appro@@ vals for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ yn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency relief or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ ri@@ osis of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ gabe , followed by 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0,25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is performed in another result , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention to 1,75 mg / kg / hr will be increased .
after PCI requirements the reduced inf@@ eri@@ osis dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a Bol@@ us@@ gabe should be administ@@ ered to 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ al@@ ous intraven@@ ous form of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a all@@ est Bol@@ us @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI surgery is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) expi@@ res in 225 seconds , a second bolt from 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values should be the re@@ const@@ ituted and dil@@ uted medicines prior to the application carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis can be administ@@ ered rapidly with intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT amounts more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg Inf@@ usion is rightly administ@@ ered .
in patients with mid @-@ heavy kidney resistance ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subj@@ ected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT figure is below 225 seconds , a second over@@ dose is to be administ@@ ered from 0.3 mg / kg and to re @-@ examine the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
in patients with moderate anti @-@ kidney disease , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ Studie ( RE@@ P@@ LACE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT figure 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment on average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney failure ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also di@@ aly@@ sis patients is an@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see below section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ter@@ mination of the intraven@@ ous h@@ ep@@ arin or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous &apos;s gift of low @-@ based h@@ ep@@ arin .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolesc@@ ents and children from six years with diabetes , which need treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ ordin@@ ated ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the wa@@ iter or the upper arm , or as a permanent inf@@ usion to a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin in the regulation of gl@@ uc@@ ose sy@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or ins@@ ulin is not effective .
ins@@ ulin is very different from Human@@ ine ulin , and the change means that it appears quicker and has a shorter operating time than a short @-@ effective human factor .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a lengthy ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effectively performed , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ded hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which shows how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction in 0.@@ 14 % reduction was reduced % to 7.@@ 46 % compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for ins@@ ulin delivery periods .
in adults with type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was increased after six months with A@@ pi@@ eno in comparison to 0,30 % at human standards .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who might be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin or any other components , or in patients who are already suffering from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood@@ stream .
( September 2004 , the European Commission divided the European Commission to the San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Avent@@ is Deutschland GmbH for approval for transport@@ ing A@@ pi@@ eno in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ ste is a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdom@@ inal ceiling , the wa@@ iter or the Del@@ t@@ am@@ us@@ angle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion to the area of the abdom@@ inal thickness .
due to the decreased radi@@ o@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin capacity , the ins@@ ulin can be eliminated in patients with one limitation of liver function .
any change of the activity , the mark ( her@@ e- ) , of ins@@ ulin ( normal , ar@@ cin@@ oma ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturer method can draw a change of ins@@ ulin delivery .
3 One insufficient dosage or the break@@ down of a treatment , in particular with patients suffering from a ins@@ ulin diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic ket@@ o@@ acid ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching a patient to another ins@@ ulin or a ins@@ ulin requirement should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change to the dosage .
the re@@ occurrence of hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the work@@ profile of the used ins@@ ulin and can therefore change during the change of the treatment schem@@ as .
among the substances that raise the ble@@ eding activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzy@@ me , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ oxet@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine , fi@@ tox@@ ic@@ yl@@ lin , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ al , s@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics .

severe hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ics with awareness can be treated using an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , treated by a trained person or treated with intraven@@ ous gift by a doctor .
after a body of body , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the serious hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin controls the blood sugar levels by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( especially through sk@@ elet@@ al muscles and fat ) and through the im@@ itation of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ unt@@ is@@ in ins@@ ulin delivery occurs faster and the drug is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ ov@@ ins@@ ulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes m@@ ish@@ - T@@ us showed ins@@ ulin in the therapeutic range of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.15 % / kg , a dis@@ proportion@@ ate glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an dis@@ proportion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ ing ary effect , just like Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin leaves a twice as fast efficiency as normal Human@@ ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the complete glu@@ cos@@ ory effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
the data was evident that in an application of ins@@ ulin use in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved like with human normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
ins@@ ulin was reached in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was given than with human nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if ins@@ ulin is reached in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a compar@@ ative gly@@ cem@@ ic control is given at human nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - n@@ utes before meal ( see picture 1 ) .
