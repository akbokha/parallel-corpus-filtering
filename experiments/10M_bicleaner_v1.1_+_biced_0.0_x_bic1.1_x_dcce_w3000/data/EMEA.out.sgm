<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Study Report (EPAR) which is discussed how the Committee on Humangers can be assessed (CHMP) to get recommendations on how to use the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the box office (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please refer to the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablettes (tablets that occupy themselves in the mouth), as a solution to the One (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Replace thinking and Speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), mistrust and madness; • Bipolar disorder, with which patients manage many episodes (periods of abnormal high-mood) alternating with periods of normal spirits.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify will be applied for the treatment of severe and severe Manbic episodes and to prevent vocal episodes in patients suffering from the past on the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for quick control of disturbed accidents or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to the one or the melting-coated tablets can be applied in patients, which the sists of tablets difficulties are prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients simultaneously take other medicines which will be ababilify the same as abilify should be adjusted the dose of abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," d. h. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and diopamine, but in lesser extent as neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, carries Aripiprazol to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychological or manic symptoms and their re-occur is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The validity of abilify that can prevent the reoccur of symptoms, was investigated in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases which compared to striped unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, abilify about twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of abilify and placebo to reoccur to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of abilify injecting solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that has been compared to Lorazepam (an other antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change in symptoms of patients had been examined using a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suggested by the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body reert the melting-coated tablets and the solution to the incorporation (takes up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients showed the abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger decrease in symptoms of staginess as the patients received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased abilify in four of the five short-term studies have been more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks in more effective than placebo the re-emergence of significant episodes involved in patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg-doses fell also more effective than placebo the symptoms of staginess and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of abilify to take (observed at 1-10 of 100 patients) are extrapyrinductive disorders, coding (swelling), fatigue, nausea (nausea), fatigue, fatigue (increased saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee on human therapeutic agents (CHMP) approved the conclusion that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, which had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the probing episodes of treatment with Aripiual zole spoke to the risk exceeds the risk.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the board came to the result that the benefits of injecting solution in the rapid control of confiscated accidents and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia and in patients with some episodes in bipolar disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risk.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is shown for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their some episodes of treatment with Aripiual zol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended initial dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended initial dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, independently of the meals as a monotherapy or combining therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficiency of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the larger sensations of these patients should be considered a lower initialdosis, if clinical trials justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-induction is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripiual dose-dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behavior belongs to mental illnesses and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases since the beginning or after change of an anti-psychotic therapy also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was not a heightened superfician risks compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be applied with caution in patients with known kardiovascular Diseases, carcinations, tebrovascular diseases, conditions that are applied for hypotony predisposes (dehydration, hypovolatonic drugs) or hypertension (including akzelched and malignne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, one year or less digest, there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Aripiprazol disruptions Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at one treated with abilify patients signs signs and symptoms of a Spätdy's poetry, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient's signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns has to become all antipsychotic, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with varicali in the anamnese or at states that are associated with crampfancies in connection with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis who are associated with Alzheimer's disease patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an elevated death toll compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study involving fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the contacting for undesirable zerebrovascular events with Aripiual patients to be treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacid or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients suffering with atypical antipsychotic agents.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycaemia-related events in affabilify and other atypical antipsychotic drug-treated patients who allow direct comparison.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, Polyvalence, Polyphagie and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar manic, the use of antipsychotic medicines, where weight gain is known as secondary effects and could lead to gravely complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally located pharmaceuticals with excess side effects as seedding (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 Antagonist of Famotidine, a Magnetic acid-Blocker, reduces the Resorption rate of Aripiprazol, although this effect is not considered to be clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy prostate, a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidine) replaced by Aripiprazol by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be done similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisation, the common application with high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher Plasmatzol result in comparison to CYP2D6 extensively vabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If we consider the common gift from ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors to abilify should outweigh the potential benefits the potential risks for patients.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV reproduction inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting up the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dosage should be raised from abilify on the dosages before the start of the Begleittherapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 will be administered together with abilify can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Arianprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol per day showed no significant effect on the metabolic disorders of the substrate of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodology), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiual zol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of people and due to the toxicity studies on animal studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the possible benefits are justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However also in other antipsychotic medication the patients should be warned of, dangerous machines, including fuel vehicles, to use until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (M1 / 100) than on placebo or were classified as possible medical-related side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the below effects is defined in accordance with the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, a total of reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akasisie, Dystonie and Dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study higher than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS increased 19% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients among placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, and 15.1% in patients among Olanzapin therapy.</seg>

<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients among Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those in lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term recovery period over 26 weeks at a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients among Aripiprazol- treatment and 15,7% for those treated with placebo patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient's groups under Aripiprazol and placebo where potential clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters came, revealed by no medically important differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increase the CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3,5% of patients with Aripiual patients, compared to 2.0% of those treated with placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic medication, the malignne neuroleptal syndrome, Spätdyskinpoetry and varicuity, unwanted events and increased mortality with older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch of an intentional or intentional excuses with Aripiual zol just observed in adult patients with estimated doses from up to 1260 mg and without death succession.</seg>
<seg id="73">While there is no information about the effectiveness of an overcatalyst with Aripiprazol, however; it is unlikely, however, that hercatalysis is used in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, as Aripiprazol indicates a high plasma cutting attachment.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disruption about the combination of a participalistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is taught.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1 noreptiles and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In case of Aripiprazole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks at healthy respondents showed the positive-dependent reduction of the Binding of 11C-Racloprid, an D2 / D3 receptor Ligue, on Nucleus caudatus and the putstream.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed an statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperidol-controlled trial was conducted in week 52 of the proportion of respondents in patients who held a response to the degree of study discussion, in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Aktuelle Zeit from Messskalen that have been defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement as in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia an significantly higher reduction of the declining rate, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% on placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olant-controlled, multinational-blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved and included in the primary importance of patients (N = 18 or 13% of the valuable patient assessment) at significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of minimum 5.6 kg at an average weight of approx.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazol a versus placebo superior effectiveness in reducing Manpolar symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study about 3 weeks in fixing dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo not superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar order, Aripiprazol showed a versus placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a consumer effect that was comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole proved to be a comparative proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manenia, like lithium or semoperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, which partly over 2 weeks do not occur on lithium - or Valproat-monotherapy in therapeutic serum, revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to the monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-time expansion phase about 74 weeks in manic patients occurring with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before Randomization to placebo superior in terms of prevention of bipolar return, predominantly in prevention of a relapy back into the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro-studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroplaning of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyition is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Eliminationshalbwertszeit lies at approximate 75 hours for Aripiprazol in extensively vae metabolic mechanisms about CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisation over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol, there are no differences in the pharmaceutical inetics between male and female healthy volunteers, just as shown in a pharmacogenetic investigation of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A piece-specific evaluation of the pharmaceutical inetics has no indication of clinically significant differences in respect to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmaceutical catinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacological properties of Aripiprazol and dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison with young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Probanden with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect with regard to the impairment of liver cirrhosis of Aripiprazol and dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study embraced only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to pull conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on security systems, toxicity at repetitive gift, reproduciicity, Genotoxicity and the kania potential, the preclinical data have no special danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were only observed in doses and expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure for humans, so they have limited only limited or no meaning for the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects are huts a dosaging-dependent adrenal periodine rinks (AUC) in Ratten to 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the moderate Steady state exposure to female donate in 60 mg / kg / day (the 10fold of the medium Steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maxaldosis in humans).</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Study Report (EPAR) which is discussed how the Committee on Humangers can be assessed (CHMP) to get recommendations on how to use the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type-2 diabetes (also known as not in insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetesmedikament) can not be applied together with another diabetesmedikament (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It may additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) which cannot be adjusted in the highest tolerable dose with metformin alone.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphyltant or insulin, the previous dose of sulfuylharnants or insulin can be kept at the beginning of the actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycaemia (lower blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of sulphylharnants or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the physical insulin can be improved better and the blood sugar levels, which makes them better to adapt to type-2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of accounts in tripley were examined; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphylsevere hydrogen, in addition they received either ACO or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of substance in the blood (glycosylified Hämoglobin, HbA1c) measured, which shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease of the HbA1c value, which makes it possible to cut blood sugar levels in the application of the dosing of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triplet trial, the effect of the additional gift from Actos to an existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylactic acid contained in a reduction in HbA1c-values to 0,94%, while the additional gift of placebo for a reduction of 0,35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, instructing the Actos in addition to insulin, compared to compared to the HbA1c values of 0,69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who were additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (cold, weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (diminished sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts must be applied neither in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazon or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketacal (high brightness) - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos within a monotherapy (in use) as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin patients should serve with which metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission divided the European Commission to the Company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve the transport of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white, white, round, domed and carry on one side the markings "15" and on the other side the wording "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also shown for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar has been inadequate and in which metformin due to contraindications or intolerance is inappropriate (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain or oils, especially those with reduced kardialer reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in symptoms and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain and oils, when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous advanced makrovascular disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on congestive heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">For patients with increased output level (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of liver illness may not be deployed to Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirror up to 3 times of the upper limit of the standard are increased, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient's symptoms developed to refer to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified, fatigue, weaving, fatigue and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymes to review.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patient with pioglitazon continues until progression of lab parameters should be guided by the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials of Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain is demonstrated that may be aggregated by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid head.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemorrhoid, among the therapy with Pioglitazon a minor reduction of the middle head (relative reduction by 4%) and of the haematokrits (relative reduction by 4,1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemangiylharness and insulin (relative reduction of hematglobins by 1-2%) and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin resistance, in patients, the pioglitazon as oral or three-dimensional therapy with a sulphonic therapy with insulin, is the risk of dosaging hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with Thiazolidindian, including Pioglitazon, has reported on an occurrence or a deterioration of a diabetic macular enzyme with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular disorders, but prescribed doctors should report on the possibility of a makeup course, if patients report about disorders of the tendings; a suitable ophthalmologic evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of reports of unwanted events related to bone marrow from randomised, controlled, double-blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The increased flawless incidence was 1.9 freight rates per 100 patient-years in patients with pioglitazon traded women and 1.1 fractures for per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years at the study of cardiovascular events, performed fractures in 44 / 905 (5.2%; 1.0 freight rates per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a mental medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deducted (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical odynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicinal drugs, the metabolic metabolized by such enzymes, such as oral Contrazeptiva, cyclosporin, Calciumkanalblocker and HMGCoA reduction are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-Indutor) resulting in a lowering of AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon which diminished in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the maternity and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal system.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single waste: unknown (from these data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a transitory variation in the turmoors and the inhibiting of the lens, as they are observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials of Pioglitazon, ALT-acts usually performed on the trim of the upper limit of the standard, however often on as under placebo, however more rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or Sulfonylharnstoff.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced makrovascular illness, the incidence of severe ingestive heart failure among Pioglitazon was 1,6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch of the market launch, however, has been reported abingestive heart failure among pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with hernia failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of reports of unwanted events related to bone marrow from randomised, controlled, double-blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients carried out in patients with pioglitazon traded groups and over 7,400 patients in the patient-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon treated patients compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients suffering from a unioncology.</seg>
<seg id="797">When the reported highdosis of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days have no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific key receptors (Peroxide receptor)) which results in the animal model to an increased insulin labeling of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon increases the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosine ratio in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as monotherapy was conducted over two years to investigate the time up to the retrospect of the therapeutic effects (defined as HbA1c * 8.0% after the first 6 treatments).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of therapy, blood sugar-control was defined (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of patients to be maintained (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebokuncontrolled trial over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar has been inadequate, despite dreimonatiful optimization phase with insulin or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under semoglitazone, the mean HbA1c is reduced by 0,45%, compared to patients who continued to only insulin; a reduction in insulin is observed in the group treated with pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed itself under Pioglitazon, an statistically significant reduction of the Albumin / Kreatinine lotions compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effects of Pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, arranged on 18 weeks the examination of type-2 diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma Triglyceride and the free fatty acids and a rise of HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor, though clinically observed increased LDL levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclazide the total plasels glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo among Pioglitazon is not an statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, observed during metformin and extremclazide diminished values.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon is not only the sober-triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this has a effect on the triglycemic absorption than also on hepatic triglycemic synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous advanced makrovascular illness in groups that were reported via a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is resome rapidly, with the peak-concentration of unchanging pioglitazon in plasma was usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution from M-IV to the effectiveness in approximately the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is particularly pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In Interactionstudies that Pioglitazon cannot be any relevant effect on the pharmaceutical ingenetics or pharmaceutical odynamics of dioxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 - inhibitors) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-induction) and lowers the plasleoncentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive market pioglitazon in humans the markers was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and a lesser extent in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma was Eliminationshalbwertszeit of unchanging pioglitazone is 5-6 hours, and all the active metabolic disorders within 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plaspionage of pioglitazon and its metabolic disorders are lower in patients with reduced renal kidney function lower than with healthy probands, whereby the rates of the oral clearing is similar but resemble.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies performed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys disagreement after repeated administration, plasma volume, with hematlution, anemia and reversibility of eccentric coronary hypertropic.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazon which diminished in the gestation of hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance to the maternity and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal system.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced by the rat increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the ureblow epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family-like polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thonolidindians led to an increased frequency of piston.</seg>

<seg id="823">The increased flawless incidence was 1.9 freight rates per 100 patient-years in patients with pioglitazon traded women and 1.1 fractures for per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years at the study of cardiovascular events, performed fractures in 44 / 905 (5.2%; 1.0 freight rates per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a mental medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study about two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with pioglitazon or extremis studied.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year in Pioglitazon, there is an statistically significant reduction of the Albumin / Kreatinine lotions compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon is not only the sober-triglyceride level, but improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this has a effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption than also on hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences from the systemic exposure of Tacrolim, this can lead to a transplanment of side effects, including sub- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always remain the same Tacrolim formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; transformations of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the engaging control of a doctor's transplant physician (see Securities 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative wording, a therapeutic drug-monitoring and corresponding dosisadaptions are to be conducted to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tacrolim will remain.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Da die kidney function does not affect the pharmaceutical ininetics of Tacroslimus, can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrasian potentials of Tacrolim, there is a careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular basis of the serum inspections, a calculation of the bladder control and a monitoring of the urinary tract).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Adjustment from Ciclosporin to Advagraf in the shift from a Ciclosporate to a Tacrolim-based therapy is caution prepared (see Securities 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the talmirror in full blut The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulsion and compatibility in individual case with the increase of full-blood-blood-blood level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is advised to perform common controls of the tacrolim talmirror during the first two weeks after the transplant, followed by periodic controls during the maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood level of blood levels of tacrolim should also be controlled according to Prograf on Advagraf, Dosage adaption, changes to immunosuppressive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances, which could change the tacrolim-enforcement blood-centration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf has a medicine with a low Clearance, customization may require multiple days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies allow that successful treatment in most cases is possible when the evasion in the blood will not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice the level of blood levels of Tacrolimus can usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and when a heart transplants patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent enhilling therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants were usually used blood configurations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe undesirable events, including transplants or other side effects, which can occur in a result of Tacrolim under- or exexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always remain the same Tacrolimus-formulation and the appropriate daily dosage should only be carried out under the engaging control of a doctor's transplant physician (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">In favour of prophylaxis of transplants at adult heart transplants and transplants in the child-old are still no clinical data for retarded form Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which can lead to a lowering of the Tacroslimine levels in the blood and a mitigate of the clinical effect of Tacrolim, is the intake of herbal supplements containing currant (hypericum perforatum), or other plant breeding during a treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations performed in the blood, since the tacrolim blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf, was referred to as a cardiomyopathy or septum hypertrophia, which therefore may also occur under Advaganf.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available for the initial marketing application, the CHMP will continue to be judged positively as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored during the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a contribution from PSURs all 6 months required, decided that the filing in 5 years is intended to apply another lengthening procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited registered the Committee on Humanpharma's Committee (CHMP) officially recognizing that the company decreases its application for approval from Advent to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the pasture (tissues that connect other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) of this.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that genetically modified so that it can be gene in the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin, it is an "Adenovirus" that has been so altered that there can be no copies of themselves and thus do not trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advent could have been carved in the tumors directly and permit the cancerous cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is not formed from the defective in the human body existing p53 gene, is usually contributing to the restoration of damage DNA and to the killing of the cells when the DNA can not be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53-Gen is defective, the p53 protein is not correct, and the cancerous cells may continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company placed data from a study involving a patient, at the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the undertaking, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP tested the responses of the company on the questions provided, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the testing of initial documents, the CHMP tag creates a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, SMP was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advent in Li-Fraumeni-tumors will bring benefits to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medication by means of the body, the kind of administration, and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not proven sufficiently that advance can be produced in a reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aeronze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, characterized by an allergy against pollen, inflammation of the nose-tract) in patients with nostripes (mutilling nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers from 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aeronze is recommended twice daily with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be completed as soon as symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose-stril (hidden nose), prokled.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A total treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be traced on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main-efficiency dimensions were the changes in the severity of the locuine symptoms, which were reported from patients before starting treatment and during the 15-day treatment reported.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients bore their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scala how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In looking of all hay-symptoms, except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the Aeronents reported on a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients, the pseudoepedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nose-stril was regarded, the patients showed by Aeronze loss of symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26,7% in patients that have desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aeronze (observed at 1-10 of 100 patients) are achyness, westeroids, psychomotoric hyperactivity (illfulness, headaches, headaches, fatigue, insomnia), somnipotency (sleeplessness), somnipotency and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeronze must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoepedrine or any of the other constituents, against innoreputable agents or loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies) are not to be applied.</seg>

<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however it is in the whole to swallow (that is, without cracking, to crush or to chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeronze should be applied to inconsistency and efficacy (see section 5.1) not to be applied in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after closing the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as for long-term application the activity of pseudoepedrine with the period can take.</seg>

<seg id="1672">Da Aeronze Pseudoepedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoaminoxase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributed to the alphamimetic activity in combination with other vasoephedrals such as broodcriptors, Pergolid, hybridal, diihydroergotamin, phenylpropanolamin, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>

<seg id="1678">Aeronze is to suspend at least 48 hours before implementing such a biological tests, as anti-histaminika may otherwise be able to prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin actions or reduce the extent to their magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials at desloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole additionally administered were not clinically observed any clinically relevant interactions and changes in the plaseptic centration of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The outcomes of the psychomotortic tests could not be detected significant differences between the patients with loratadine and the patients treated with placebo-treated patients independently of whether desloratadine alone or with alcohol consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1681">This has not yet been identified for the metabolic ism of desloratadine enzymes so that interactions with other drugs cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro-studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 will not be inhibited and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-Glyhead.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The irreconciless of the use of aeronze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison with the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies of animals can not always be transmitted to humans and due to vasostriktorical properties of pseudoepedrine, Aeronze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be clarified that in very rare cases it may come to a stuper or the ability to use machines.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee on Humanarztett (CHMP) officially unveiled the company's application for approvals from Aflunov to the prevention of aviary H5N1-influenza amongst adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov ought to be applied in adults and elderly people to protect the flu, which is caused by the trunk (type) H5N1 from the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that could cause a trunk of flu, which could cause a future cordemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A influenza demic breaks out when a new trunk of the grip virus emerges, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine the immune system recognizes the immune system the parts of the flu virus as "body alien" and it forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Due to this, the immune system is later able to form in touch with a grip virus this stem of faster antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently the membrane envelope the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a body alien), opened up and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scale of the clinical data base for evaluating the security of the vaccine is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA to pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please refer to the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with human immenviral virus from Type 1 (HIV-1), which are the acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients, who can not swallow the capsules, it may be taken as a solution to the inclusion, but this cannot be taken along with Ritonavir, since the safety of this combination was not studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Avase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined, which antiviral medicines has previously been taken before, and the likelihood has assumed that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken twice daily with twice daily ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four to twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of algenase is aimed at body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, it reduces HIV amount in blood and keeps them at low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not cure AIDS, however, may delay the immune system of immune system and thus also delay the development of HIV infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Avase has been studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, however, without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV infected adults, which had not been treated with the controller previously.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This compared with low dosire Ritonavir enhanced medicine Avase was taken with 206 adults, which had previously been previously protector previously, with other proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non-evidence concentrations of HIV in the blood (Viruslast) or the change in the viral last after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had been taken a prototype, after 48 weeks under Agenerase, more patients had a viral last to 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but strangenase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, aurease also decreased the viral last but with the children, which were previously treated with the indictee, only very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, which had previously been treated with a file, lowered that with Ritonavir enhanced medicine Avase the Viruslast after 16-week treatment are just as effective as other steads:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteins, it came under Avase, along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the viral last for four weeks than in the patients carrying out their previous prototype.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerasis (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), Flatence (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 aurease may not be applied in patients who might be hypersensitive (allergic) against amonavir or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Asrease may not be applied in patients, the currant (herbal remedy for the treatment of depression) or drugs, which are as well as generic medicines and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV in patients, the Agenerasis has to take the risk of a Lialystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), a osteonecular (withering of bone tissue) or an immunreactive synchronisation (symptoms of an infection that are caused by the rejuvenating immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Humangers (CHMP) approved the conclusion that the benefits of aspirant medicines used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of associated with the responsible previously untreated HIV-1-infected adult and children over four years compared with the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Avase is usually taken together with the pharmacogeninetic amplifier ritonavir, but the Committee established that the benefits of Avase in combination with Ritonavir in patients, which previously did not have been proven any protector.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "asrease was initially approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "there is limited information at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">For October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited Limited with a permit to approve the transport of Agenase throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Avase is combined with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, protector (PI) subject to adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usually, Avase capsules should be administered to pharmacogenetic boosting manufacturing with low doses of Ritonavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavr should take place in consideration of the individual viral Resistenzmusters and the treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amaciavir as a solution to the inclusion is 14% lower than by Amprenavir than Kapsel; therefore, Azoase capsules and solution to one milligram per milligram is not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Avase capsules is 600 mg lorynavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenase capsules are applied without the intensifying additive of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses should be applied to asrease (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Avase capsules is 20 mg amnesmg / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmaceutical ininetics, effectiveness and safety of argenase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protein assemblies have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Avase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the misuse of data to unobjectionable and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacogenic data, dose to Agenerase capsules should be reduced to approximately 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be used in patients with mild or moderate-functioning, in patients with severe liver-functioning it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asrease must not be given simultaneously with medicinal products that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements containing Johannisle (hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced Plasmatitis and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprencar (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be cautioned that asphyase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not result in curing HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asympic, does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usually, aspiration capsules should be applied along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral dual application therapy, have an increased risk of severe liver incidents with potentially fatal disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the event of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please check the relevant information of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing restrictions, including a chronically-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Avase and Ritonavir with fluticason or other gluccioids, which are confused about CYP3A4, is not recommended that the possible benefit of a treatment reduces the risk of systemic cortical vials including morphing and suppression of the adrenal function. (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the fuel-changing of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovingly strongly dependent on CYP3A4, will not be recommended for simultaneous administration of aspiration with Lovastatin and simvastatin because of the increased risk of myopia including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medications, which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standardization Ratio) are available methods for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these medicines at the same time, Avase may be less effective because of the so-called plusal seal of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir can be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadon is given simultaneously with amaviavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium issue symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of risk of toxicity due to high propylene glycos, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four years and should be applied to caution with certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Avase should be discontinued in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients suffering from antiretroviral therapy, including prototype, has been reported on the appearance of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases which were needed in their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>

<seg id="1956">With hammophiles patients (type A and B), which were treated with a controller, there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous hematoms and haematoarthritis before.</seg>
<seg id="1957">At the time the introduction of an antiretroviral therapy (ART) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial Aegeology is accepted (including application of cortico-repression, higher Body Mass Index), cases of osteonekrose in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term waste of an antiretroviral-therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4-substrates with low diagnostic width Avase must not simultaneously be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals, which have a small therapeutic width and also present substrates of cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6-substrates with low therapeutic width Avase with Ritonavir must not be combined with pharmaceuticals, whose active ingredients are predominantly connected via CYP2D6 and are associated for increased plasma-bricks with severe and / or life-threatening effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC by Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to put the humilious plasma-cell through a tin increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were observed very frequently unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The Serumspiegel of Amprenavir can be dehumbled by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with currant (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already includes currant, the amusal levels are and, if possible to review the viral load and liberate the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drug is not necessary when Nelumavir administered along with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax, against 30% humiliated if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg are used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily that enclosures the effectiveness and harmlessness of this treatment procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% low, if Amamavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values by Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg) were reached twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg) lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A metering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, there will be a narrow machine monitoring because the effectiveness and irregularity of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacological study carried out in combination with Didanosine, however, is recommended due to the antacid component of Didanosin, however, that the revenue from Didanosin and Avase is at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in case of gift from Efavirency in combination with amnesavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) do not require a dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amegavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protectasis was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other protector and existing data suggests that nevirapinto the serum centration of amprenavir might be senkt.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable, since Delavirdin may be less effective because of the decreased / or possibly subtherapeutic plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these medicines will be applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological supervision should be performed, since a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amblavr and Ritonavir is tricky on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of amyavr and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasleoncenter (AUC) by Rifabutin around 193% and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with Rifabutin side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is needed for clinical reasons, rifabutin together with Agenerase is required to achieve a reduction in dosage of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dosage although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical research in combination with erythromycin were not conducted, but the plasma-cell of both medicinal products could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Foscaviazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole once daily resulted in increasing the Cmax of ketoconazole once daily with a comparison to 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inmer or inductors of CYP3A4, if they are applied together with aspiration may possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxicity reactions that are connected to these drugs once they are applied in combination with aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protector, it is advisable that the antacid cannot be taken at the same time as asrease, as it can be resoratory disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulva, which are known as an enzyme (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with amprenavir can lead to a humiliation of plasma-cell.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The Serum concentrations of calcium channels such as Amlodipin, Dilatazem, Felodipin, Niewpin, Nippdipin, Nimodipin, Nisoldipin and losamil may be increased 10 by Amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with asphyase can increase sperm and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules are performed twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonat intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days at Probanden, dropped out by approximately 86% (90% concluding intervals 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous Gift of Agenerasis will not be advised along with these gluctikids along with these gluctikeroids, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment is associated to the risk of systemic Cortikosteroy effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin and simvastatin, whose fuel alternation strongly depends on CYP3A4, are expected to expect increasing plasma angles in simultaneous administration of anoproase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Da Plasmaspiegelenhances this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to Myopathy including a rhubometar can lead, the combined application of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to the stabilization of the mirror, because the plasma-concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolim can be increased in a simultaneous gift of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Avase should not be applied together with orally flown Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while being offered with parmesan with parenteral Midazolam with caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous application of parenteral Midazolam with other protein inhibitors to a possible increase in plasma-bricks of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadon administered along with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore observe symptoms in opium symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per se minor readability of historical comparisons, cannot be given any recommendation as the amprenavir- dose is to be shifted, if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In a simultaneous display of warfarin or other oral anticoagulbans combined with Ageneracy, the enhanced control of the INR (International Standarotic ratio is recommended, because of the possibility of a weaker or reinforcement of the anti-throotic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contradiction is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example 'Desireamine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in a current gift of asympic (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied during pregnancy, after careful checked of potential uses for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-active rats were demonstrated in ampediavir-related substances, it is however not known whether Amprenavir goes with people into the mother's milk.</seg>

<seg id="2003">The similarity of Avase has been studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase inhibitor were slightly to moderate, they appeared early and rarely resulted in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events is not clarified whether they are related to the intake of asphyase or any other at the same time regarding HIV treatment's disease, or whether they are a result of the disease infection.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the listed side effects are taken from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), where with a release partial, patients 1200 mg Avase twice daily received.</seg>

<seg id="2029">Companies, the diagnostic test tests, have developed clinically-phenomenal Cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV which may be applied to the interpretation of results of a Resistal tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a decreased persensitivity against amonavir associative pattern creates a certain crusence against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistence between amprenavir and other steadjunctions for all 4 Fosampsusavir Resistenzpfade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not previously untreated patients, in which a fossil-resistance against Lopinzinr / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Coquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against several other protector-resistant insulation; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance-mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early dawning of a reconciled therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations in limits that can affect the following treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The cover of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily basis is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised person (viral membrane). (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with the lowdosified Ritonavir, "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Sixty-thirteen-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus-sensitivity to asphyase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis introduced the non-subembarrassment of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in relation to the SOC-PI group in the virus-last (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-press shaft of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unboostempowered aurease is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were assigned with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Azoase solution has been used in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI patients had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the study included in the study included a plasma cutting level &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the starting point.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basics on this data should be considered for the treatment-optimised children of the expected children of the expected benefit of "unnative" anoproase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax was reduced by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% lowering of AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amainable 12 hours to servings (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration stayed in the steady state (Cmin, ss) from the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake is influenced by the scale and rate of the Rescue.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seeming volume of distribution is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and makes up a large distribution volume, as well as an enormous penetration of amprenavir from the blood circulation out of the blood circulation.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the drug in plasma, whereby the amount of uninjunequated amusal, represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unexpectancy remains constant, the percentage of free active components during the loss intervals, depending on the overall drug Concentration in the Steady state power over the range of Cmax, ss up to Cmin.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that inject CYP3A4 incised or imbate or substrate or a substrate of CYP3A4, which can be administered with caution when they are simultaneously given by anase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The Gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenate exposure, as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amamavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules, therefore, Azoase solution and aspiration capsules are not interchangeable at a milligrams.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Even the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore, it should be the impact of kidney-functioning upon the elimination of amonavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to amprenavir-Plasmaspiegs similar to those who are at healthy probanden after a dose of 1200 mg amnesr twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on juriogens by mice and rats occurred at male animals benigne hepatocular Adenome in doses, that said to the 2,0 times (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to people, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg amprenavir, escaped.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocular hydenome and carcinoma has not yet been unsolved, and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposition data on people, both from clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, little evidence for the acceptance of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>

<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma position, the significant among (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage when humans lay, however, have been observed a number of minor changes including Thymuselongation and minor skeleton changes that are relied on a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenase capsules are applied without the intensifying additive of Ritonavir (boosting), higher doses should be applied to asrease (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Avase capsules is 20 mg amnesmg / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application is to be used in patients with watchful or more liver-compulsive disorder, in patients with severe liver-functioning it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drugs, which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standardization Ratio) are available methods for determining the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2072">A metering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, there will be a narrow machine monitoring because the effectiveness and irregularity of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amegavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protectasis was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these medicines will be applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological supervision should be performed, since a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amblavr and Ritonavir is tricky on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons, rifabutin together with Agenerase is required to achieve a reduction in dosage of Rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dosage 31, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The Serum concentrations of calcium channels such as Amlodipin, Dilatazem, Felodipin, Niewpin, Nippdipin, Nimodipin, Nisoldipin and losamil may be increased by Amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules are performed twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonat intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days at Probanden, dropped out by approximately 86% (90% concluding intervals 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In a simultaneous display of warfarin or other oral anticoagulbans combined with Ageneracy, the enhanced control of the INR (International Standarotic ratio is recommended, because of the possibility of a weaker or reinforcement of the anti-throotic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin by Amprenavir by 22% in bzw.</seg>

<seg id="2175">The cream is adjustable before bedtime digeonically to the affected skin areas so that they remains enough for long (about eight hours) on the skin before it is washed off.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies, Aldara was compared to a placebo (the same cream, but without the active ingredients). • Aldara was tested in four main studies at 923 patients with warts in the genital area of 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete replication of the treated warts. • Aldara is also examined in two trials in which patients were treated for six weeks and Aldara or the placebo either per day or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete dedivision of tumors after twelve weeks. • Aldara is also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with aktincal keratins.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara is more effective than the placebo in all four main studies 15% to 52% in patients with Aldara patients, but only 3% to 18% in patients treated with undara patients compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="2191">In an application of Imiquimod cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is increased risk for heavy local coatings (see Section 4.2.) In rare cases, by proper application, heavy local coatings have been observed, which made a treatment necessary and / or led to a temporary physical impairment.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occur at the outcome of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, which made a emergency catheterisation and a treatment of the affected area.</seg>

<seg id="2204">The available data on the cal keratose on the underpoor and hands support the effectiveness in this application form, therefore an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local transitional actions frequently occur, but these reactions normally take in the course of therapy from intensity or go back after decomposing the therapy with imiquimiodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If local skin reactions tend to cause great discomfort or are very strong, treatment may be exposed for some days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical trial, patients with more than 8 AK- lesions are considered a lower complete cure of therapy than patients with fewer than 8 lesions.</seg>

<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients can develop infusion-borne reactions, which are defined as any standing side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infantithesis (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored by engaging and infusion of Aldurazyme should be at disposal only in a reasonable clinical setting, in the revitational facilities for medical emergencies will be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3-study, it is expected to constitute almost all patients with IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infection-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections, 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Given a little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer break, must be careful due to the theoretically possible risk response after a break in treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medications (antihistaminika and / or anti-pyretics) to minimize the potential potential of infection-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of an easy or medium-sized infection-conditioned response, treatment with antihistaminika and paramacic / Ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, heavy infusion reaction, the infusion must be halted until the symptoms are brought to decline, treatment with antihistoinika and paraccreamol / Ibuprofen is weakened.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be applied with a reduction in infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion in which the reaction occurred again.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistaminika and paramicamol / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion in which the prescribed reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with intracellular recording of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Veteran studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were exposed to Laronidase over the mother's milk, is recommended, during treatment with Aldurazyme is not to breastfeed.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Side effects in clinical trials were predominantly defined as infusion-related reactions, which were observed at 53% of patients in phase 3-study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (length of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted research reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3- study and their extension to a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table after the following orders: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequently (ct-1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>

<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable pharmaceutical campaigns, even if the appearance of undesirable development interactions typically developed with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme treatment is in one for the hydrolysse of the accumulated substrats and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyvity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and recorded by cells into the lymphomas, most likely about creosis-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of Aldurazyms were examined in a randomised, double-blind phase-3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients have been recruited for the study, the entire disease spectrum was reported, the majority of patients struck by the medium-sized phenotype and only a patient proved a severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had an accelerated loan volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute side track in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label renewal programs, where they received another 3,5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks therapy the patients were treated with Alduracyme as compared to the placebo group an improvement in the lung function and the ability to display in the table below.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corticosteroids (a medicine which can be used as anti-inflammatory).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as the effects contained in this age group is not enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance the bond of chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin), observing the receptors in the intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi has been studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults, which received chemotherapies which are a strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 59% of patients treated with aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy alone (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients with Ondansetron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In Chemotherapies, an excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are showed 81% of patients treated with aloxi, in the 24 hours following chemotherapy alone (153 of 189), to 69% of patients with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron, these values at 63% for Aloxi (119 from 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission was divided against the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for marketing authorization of Aloxi within the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indices: to prevent evacuated nausea and vomiting at strongly emetogenous chemotherapy due to cancer illness and for prevention of nausea and vomiting against cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of alxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, that is induced by a strong insetogenous chemotherapy, can be reinforced by adding one before the corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Da Palonosetron can extend the Dickdarmpass, patients should be monitored with anamnesty shelter or signs of a submares Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable to extend the administration of Palonosetron with pharmaceuticals, which prolongs the QT-interval or with patients, where the Qt- intervall is extended or which incline to such a extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In connection with a further chemical physiotherapeutics, Aloxi will neither be used in the days following chemotherapy for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical trials hemmed Palonosetron, carried out against tumours of the five studied Chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, no significative pharmacogenic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steer-static concentration oralen metoclopramids, one CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacological analysis has been shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-Induulations (Amiodaron, Celecoxib, Fritidine, Paroxetine, Haloperidol, Paroxetine, Chinonavir, serverine and Terbinafin) has no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies occur not before, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is considered to be treated by the doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, most common in a dose of 250 micrograms were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), who at least possibly with aloxi in the context were headaches (9%) and shelter (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive actions and reactions on agreements (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing report reviews.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest doses showed similar frequency of unwanted events as in the other metering groups; there were no dose-active relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were not performed, due to the large distribution of distribution, however, is probably not an effective therapy for a Aloha overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomized double-blind studies, 3.1 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) received, which was given on day 1 without the dexamethone intravenous case.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind studs became a total of 667 patients who received a strongly incremental chemotherapy with over 60 mg / m2 of Cyclophosphamide and dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, compared with patients who were given 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given on day 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenous chemotherapy is summarised in the tables below.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced sickness and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were compared to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the QTc-interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the invented clinical studies, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the icon of the ventricular DE- and Repolarisation involved and extend the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy respondents was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.V. administered Palonosetron in single dosen from 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resolation After intravenous Gabe, following a slowing decrease of Plasmakoncentrations a slow rimination from the body with an average-terminal half-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plaspioncenter (Cmax) and the surface under the concentrations-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally applied in the entire dosage range from 0.3- 90 μ in / kg with healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift of Palonosetron 68mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the middle of 11 high temperature carcinations between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-Plasmatoncentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacogenic simulations goes out that the overall intravenous form of 0,25 mg of palm oil (AUC0- ∞) reached with that after non-recurring reciprocal administration of 0,75 mg measured value; however, the Cmax was according to the single delivery of 0,75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolic disorders that have compared to Palonosetron via less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolic mechanisms have shown that CYP2D6 and, in low dimensions, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in Metabolism by Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of a intravenous dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unaltered substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Boletical object, overall body-clearance 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing period 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Though, in patients with severe liver-functioning, the terminale Eliminationshalbwerg and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, a reduction in the dose is therefore unjustified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions that may be considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a small relevance to the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical trials, evidence points out that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentration of concentrations, which are involved in ventricular DE- and replicarization and can prolong the shareholders.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (every dose which was given in about the triple of therapeutic exposure to men) which were given every day over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver circlos, pituitary, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, pancreas, however not with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the high doses and since aloxi is determined by humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is low as for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Humanitarian Affairs (CHMP) adopted a negative assessment, in which the authorization of approval for the transportation of the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for electro 6 million IE / ml injecting solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is similar to a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same practices that has already been approved in the EU (also called "reference rate").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long lasting) hepatitis C (one caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver cirrhosis indicates damages, in addition, the values of the Leberenzms Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) increased in blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which resulted in the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The producer of Alpheon provided data that occupy the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredients, composition and purity of the medication, drugs, safety and effectiveness of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study to patients with hepatitis C, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study has been measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 therapy sessions as well as 6 months after inapprove of the treatment to the drug said (i.e. no sign of the virus is referred to in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore there have been arguing that the data for the stability of the drug and the ban on drugs should not be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease affected more patients than with the reference rate; also aleon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the study carried out in the study to examine the question, how much the drug imposes a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with cracking-going skin infection) and small inidentified inpagations (Rissor or mouldings), dediced and paralysed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, which may be traceable or presumably caused by methicillinresistent Forhylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against these kinds of infections might not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo may be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but for patients under 18 years old can not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient has not responded to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosom (the parts of the bacterienzelle, in which proteins are produced), and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness was described in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was diverted towards the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52,1%) of 71 patients among placebo talked to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-wounds, altargo and Cefalexin similar contact: if the results of both studies were regarded in Hautwunden, spoke about 90% of the patients of both groups to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, were discovered that Altargo was caused in the treatment of wasteland (the crowded cavities in the body tissues) or from infections, which may be proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which has been observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the door.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humangers (CHMP) approved the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo after the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • inverse little launderes, disables or genres wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for approchement of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, which are not counting on improvement within two or three days, should be examined once more and an alternative therapy will be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitizing or serious local irritation through the application of Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be canceled, the anointment carefully abused and an adequate alternative therapy of the infection are started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be applied to treat infections, with which MRSA is known as Erreger or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary and open wound, the effectiveness of retapamulin was caused by patients with infections, which were caused by a methicillin resistent Forhylococcus aureus (MRSA), unsufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment, no improvement or a deterioration of the infected.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicine is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small plasma-centric, which were reached by humans after topical application on a diced skin or infected superficial cheological, a clinically relevant inhibition were not expected in vivo (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous orant gift of 2 times a day 200 mg Ketoconazol increased the average Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retapamulin Salbe to scraped skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosisadaptions are not considered necessary if desktop retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a refractional icity after oral ingestion and are inadequate in regard to a statement on the birth and the federal al / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical anti-bacterial therapy is clearly indigested and the application of retapamulin is preferably preferable to the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / stop or the therapy with altargo continues / completed is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the tarngo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials to 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, altargo was applied the most commonly reported side-effect of irritation on appointments, which consider approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance caused by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus) isolated.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective metering of bacterial proteins by interaction with a particular bond point of the 50 sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the bond of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the liaison officer rifbosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the rifbosomal P-bond and of the Peptidyltransferasefire.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By attachment to this binding headline Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, block some P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be listed due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of retapamulin, at least some infecular forms, a consultation by experts should be pursued.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the insulin were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-speaking on the treatment at S.aureus the presence of tribes should be considered with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin was produced daily under Occlusion at intact and deported skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary medical wounds, individual plasma were won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out by days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the previous application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% Salbe was saped on 200 cm2 / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The metabolic metabolic metabolic disorders by Retapamulin in human life-micronome was primarily taught by CYP3A4, under low involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is intended for protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that apply the liver) in children between the ages of one and 15 that are still not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied in one of two doses of the current vaccines, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix not only be used when immunisation is a low risk of HCV infection and ensures that the influx of two doses can be led to the end of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is required for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis C or -B vaccine would be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body) "as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccinous vaccine Twinrix 'Children and the since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix Children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines can be applied to protection against the same diseases, however, TwinCitrix and Twinrix Children are administered as part of one of three doses of the current vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults identical ingredients include, some of the data included the application of Twinrix adults, also as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the percentage of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix carried out between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of the development of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix starts at a six-month period and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headache, pietitmangel, pain on the injecting site, redness, matography (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be sensitive in patients who may not be sensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) not to be applied.</seg>

<seg id="2739">The Standardization for the primer critization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered for the first dose of 6 and 12 months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B can be vaccinated, vaccinated with the corresponding monovalous vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B-virus (anti-HBsAg) observed after a primer anti-hepatitis (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A-virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is still not fully backed up to whether immunocapable people relinqued to a hepatitis C vaccine, a refreshing vaccination should be protruined than protection, since they are also protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injections should be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine. appropriate methods of medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended by the drop-injectable hepatitis A-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface area.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemoralysis patient and individuals with disturbances of the immune system, under circumstances no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-hobs income is reached, so in these cases the gift of other vaccines may be required.</seg>

<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 and 15, after 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix is compared with the 3-doses combinant formula.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher incidence of pain and matches on a calculation basis for a vaccination. however, not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix by 50,7% of the Probanden, compared to 39.1% in the proving after the gift of a dose of 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the whole vaccine reported 66.4% of the probanden, which had received its ambiance, about pain, compared with 63.8% at the subjects, which have been vaccinated with the 3-dose.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of matches was however equivalent to a Proband (i.e., over the entire vaccine) at 39.6% of the probanden, which received its ambiental, compared with 36.2% at the subjects that got the 3-cans of combinant cavity.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of prevalence and maticity was low and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combinant formula with the 3-doses of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccines the occurrence of local actions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3-cans of combincongenital hepatitis A-A-virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B-surface area.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix is a frequent appearance of pain (at the injecting site) per dose, not per capband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that have severe adverse reactions during the 2-doses of vaccines with ambiental or during the 3-doses of vaccines with the Advanced hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis C patients, was statistically different.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been well-known since issuing of the first permit for the operator, represented the CHMP opinion that remains the benefit-risk relationship for Ambirix which remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix is only limited in one member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicinal product is limited to the low patient position.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonite may also be employed with patients at the age of over a month with incompatible encephalopathy (brain function as a result of high ammonium concentration) in the pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonap shall - split into several single trousers to meals - swallowed, under the food mixed or via a gastrodental clinic (through the abdominal blanket into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasuronde (by the nose in the stomach of the tube) administered.</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, as Ammonite may not be compared with another treatment or with placebo (a headlight ament, that is to be compared without any substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonite may also lead to appellitloss, a abnormal cleansing in blood, depression, irritability, impotence, supplements or taste, vstomach, mating, rash, rash, rash, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee on Humangers (CHMP) stimulated an end to the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urinary tract can be effectively prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonite has been approved under "extraordinary circumstances," because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The application is indexed to all patients, in which a complete encrode has already manifested in Neugeboalter (within the first 28 Lebenstage).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete encymbone, which manifests itself after the first life of life) there is an indication for the use when in anamnese is a hypercoherent encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with dysphagia, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated by taking into account the protein tolerances and the necessary daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After the previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose is Natriumphenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early realization of Carbamylphosphatsynthetic or ornithintranscarbinylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a argininosex-synthetic synthetic defect should be given arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered with dysphagia because there is a risk for the emergence of Ösophagulula if the tablets are not able to go into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every pill AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied in patients with congestive heart failure and insuffrations, as well as with sodium intentiveness and oil-suppression states only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since Metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutary about the liver and kidneys often occurs, AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney failure should be applied only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The meaning of these results in relation to pregnant women is unknown; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous gift of phenyl acetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowing of the neuronal reation and a striped loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of zerebrals synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is eliminated in humans into the milk milk, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS during lactation is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical attempts with AMMONAPS at 56% of patients had at least one undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events came out of it that they were not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy, anti-cytopenal, peripherent neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The case of an overdose came with a five months old toddler with a watering sliding of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenyl acetate, which showed a dose of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day of a doscoptic neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection, which is controlled by acetate with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is passed on via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometric is seen Phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the excretion of overthrowing nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urethecycle can be assumed that for each gramms of sodium intranate between 0,12 mm and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chance of survival and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest manifestations of the condition was almost always infarist, and the disease attributed himself to treatment with Peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or having their stuffinal analogy within the first life year.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemostalysis, the exploitation of alternative means of nitrogen effect (sodium polyphenyl acetate), proteinreduced rust and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival of new medicines at postpartal (however within the first life of life) diagnosed in 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonium encephalopathy, but even with these patients there was time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the illness (including feminine patients with the heterozygene form des Ornithintranscarbinylase deficiency), which were treated by hyperammonium encephalopathy and a proteinated diet, the survival rates were 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible for treatment and in some patients can occur another deterioration of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is convulged in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic disorders within plasma and urine were measured according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium bisphenylbutary, and with liver cirrhosis after assessments as well as repetitive gifts from oralen doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic disorders was also investigated with cancer victims of sodium bisphenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyrat in tablets were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plasuretic generated by phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urethrotary disorders or hemopaeology, according to different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning after näs at the plasma, no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">At three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeated with sodium bisphenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single dare), the middle phenylacetatkonzentrations at plasma-commerce the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (particularly unbranched amino acids), carnitine and serum protectors in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early realization of Carbamylphosphatsynthetic or ornithintranscarbinylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0,17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg. (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium polybutary, accordingly 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polybutary, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a Bolusgabe should be administered to 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initialous intravenous form of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a allest Bolus-gift from Angiox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI surgery is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) expires in 225 seconds, a second bolt from 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">To reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values should be the reconstituted and diluted medicines prior to the application carefully mixed and the Bolusdosis can be administered rapidly with intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT amounts more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1,75 mg / kg Infusion is rightly administered.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with mid-heavy kidney resistance (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), should be a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT figure is below 225 seconds, a second overdose is to be administered from 0.3 mg / kg and to re-examine the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdosis.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate anti-kidney disease, which resulted in the phase III- PCI-Studie (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT figure 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosage adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney failure (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also dialysis patients is angiox contraindicated (see below section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous's gift of low-based heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• widely known hypersensitivity to the substance, or any other components or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood pressure. • severe kidney disease, and more severe kidney disease. • severe kidney failure (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients have been carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if Bivalirudin is administered in combination with an other anticoagulans (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if at PCI-patients under Bivalirudin most of the bleeding to occur at arterial spots, can undergo in patients who occur in a perimutaneous coronarpus (PCI), during the treatment in principle anywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients, the warfarin and with Bivalirudin should be considered to be considered to ensure that the value remains possible after the treatment with Bivalirudin again prior to the treatment existing levels.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Departing from the knowledge of the novel mechanical mechanism (Heparin, Warsaw, Thrombolytika or Thrombozytenaggregationshemmer) can be assumed that these ingredients increase blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudin with trombozytenaggregation or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemorrhoid parameters are to be checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The veteran investigation are related to the impact on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the coverage or post-post development is insufficient (see below section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractiking heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the interstaged assemblies, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more frequently than undesirable developments than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding have been defined after the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding such as in table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bivalirudin alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitors and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intrakh, retroperitoneal, intraoral blood circulation or bleeding in the punctuation area, reduction of hemorrhobinary with known cladding, reproduction due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less often observed anallocalisations, which were in more than 0,1% (occasionally), "other" punctuation, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ears, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following details on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin at 6000 patients who subjected themselves to PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the interular societies, there joined women and patients over 65 years more frequently than undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleeding were performed under Bivalirudin significantly less frequently than in the fob-group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported after extensive use in practice, and are summarized by system bodies ordered in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudin is immediately niveted and the patient could monitor the patient with respect to signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and on the analogue region of Thrombin binds, irrespective of whether to be tied at the liquid phase or to Gerspisel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and with its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin turn off the relationship of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thus creating the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, by Bivalirudin with Serum of patients, in which it induced in the past to heparinduced Throbozytopenie / heparinduced Thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) had to induce no Thrombocytes-aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Healthy Probanden and in patients shows Bivalirudin a dossh- and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patients were performed in the following, an additional bolt from 0.5mg / kg Bivalirudin was added and infusion can be increased for the duration of the intervention to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-day and triple-score of a randomised double-blind study involving over 6,000 patients who subjected themselves to a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angipurox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacological properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who were subtraced to a perimplant corral interventions (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin is carried out as Peptid a catabolism in its amino acid-continuance with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabox, which result from the split of the Arg3-Pro4-bonds of the N-terminalen Sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of the affinarity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, which need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subordinated (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the waiter or the upper arm, or as a permanent infusion to a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glucose syegels (sugar) in the blood or insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin is very different from Humanine ulin, and the change means that it appears quicker and has a shorter operating time than a short-effective human factor.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a lengthy insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, in which the body insulin is not effectively performed, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance glycosylided hemostglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which shows how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction in 0.14% reduction was reduced% to 7.46% compared to a reduction of 0.14% for insulin delivery periods.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2-diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was increased after six months with Apieno in comparison to 0,30% at human standards.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients who might be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or any other components, or in patients who are already suffering from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the bloodstream.</seg>
<seg id="2976">(September 2004, the European Commission divided the European Commission to the Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for approval for transporting Apieno in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apiste is a subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal ceiling, the waiter or the Deltamusangle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion to the area of the abdominal thickness.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased radioeogenesis capacity and the diminished insulin capacity, the insulin can be eliminated in patients with one limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the activity, the mark (here-), of insulin (normal, arcinoma), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturer method can draw a change of insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 One insufficient dosage or the breakdown of a treatment, in particular with patients suffering from a insulin diabetes, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic ketoacid; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching a patient to another insulin or a insulin requirement should be done under strict medical supervision and can make a change to the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The reoccurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the workprofile of the used insulin and can therefore change during the change of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that raise the bleeding activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemics, angiotensin-Converting enzyme, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine, fitoxicyllin, propoxyal, sicylates and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic, Clonidine, Guanethidine, Guanethidine and reserpine, may be bewätigt or missing the symptoms of norepnovers.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Veteran studies for refractionable studies showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin enter into the human mother's milk, but generally the insulin is not resorted to the breast milk, nor is it resome after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are the number of clinical trials known to the undesirable pharmaceutical drugs, grouped according to system organs and ordered according to decreasing the incidence of their occurrence (slightly] / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100; seldom: &lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency on the basis of availability bait).</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemics with awareness can be treated using an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), treated by a trained person or treated with intravenous gift by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a body of body, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the serious hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin controls the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) and through the imitation of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that at subcutaneous Gauntisin insulin delivery occurs faster and the drug is shorter than at hu- manovinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes mish- Tus showed insulin in the therapeutic range of 0.075 to 0.15% / kg, a disproportionate gluing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an disproportionate increase in the gluing ary effect, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin leaves a twice as fast efficiency as normal Humaninsulin and achieves the complete glucosory effect about 2 hours earlier than humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that in an application of insulin use in 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandiale glycemic control is achieved like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin was reached in 2 minutes before meal, a better postprandial control was given than with human normalinsulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is reached in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparative glycemic control is given at human normalinsulin, which is given 2 Mi- nutes before meal (see picture 1).</seg>
