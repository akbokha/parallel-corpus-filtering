a rectang@@ le can be coated with the various properties of the appropriate file or the folder . for each property you can specify , if enough space for representation is present or if the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ances will occur ( however , indic@@ ating def@@ ect should occur through constra@@ ints regarding the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the marking in the rectang@@ le .
in the control algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the area should be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the item . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . it is drawn to present the sub@@ ordin@@ ate of entries , and this frames need space that will then be lost to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries . please note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectang@@ le square is square .
as division of an entry fee for the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries are made , the implementation is left . on this occasion , it is possible to open spaces and to prevent space losses from frames still advantageous the areas that are as quad@@ r@@ atic . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns , or record sub@@ division .
you can view the minimum shown area for an entry over the men@@ ding view view holding in area . instead a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn into the surface of an ordered item to indicate that this area is actually assigned by an associated entry .

modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera is then implemented as a record cycle . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras are used under certain conditions to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; used the program exec@@ utes for communication with digital cameras which was a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ photographer 2 is also supporting the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol , which is developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it permits the transmission of digital cameras to b@@ ills and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . as photos in general , large files are out@@ dated . &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images by photographer . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support . if the ex@@ if support is available from some lib@@ g@@ coach 2 cam@@ er@@ amen , the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ amat@@ 2 . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ ari@@ 2 , you might be possible to compreh@@ end or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE Image plugin Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; the Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s essentially simpler , &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; by writing a small module to complement a function than the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; even carry out .
to simplify the window , you can either move the side @-@ page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
this draw and down of images works everywhere : you can insert an image in another part of the tree screen , via horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture is not in keywords , fil@@ ing sli@@ ds or search results .
- a file selection allows you to raise the spread out : JPEG , PNG , TI@@ FF , ro@@ h , movies and audio

Met@@ adata are defined as data about data . met@@ adata according to your definition data , provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I d@@ are to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even use it &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; . the approach to store met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files guarantees a very fast search and secure archi@@ ving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before you want to do something into your system is the layout of information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide whether to have access to your photos , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; please note that you will have to switch to a larger disk .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location . if you were doing enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . use . export a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have different requirements such as Ver@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archi@@ ving , working procedures , constant access by pictures on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % of work files will not have to re@@ organize your structure to this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and unemployment files simpli@@ fied a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a ch@@ aired picture .
we also recommend the option Met@@ adata store in the inaugur@@ ation page of the met@@ adata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; this is certain that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data saved into the file . if you miss this , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu item .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change what happens ? to make a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes , these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now wish to give any photo keywords , sign@@ ments and valu@@ ation . of course , you can select all the images that you need the same attri@@ bute , and then set the value then . it starts with the evaluation or the ranking . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos .
let us now with keywords , keywords , as you are often called in other programs , or Categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import ess@@ ari@@ zed images from another source with embedded keywords , then becomes &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; automatically insert the tree for you to convert the images to the right place . the re@@ sort of Hier@@ archy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drag a sub@@ tree to another . the modified keywords will be taken by &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; updated while there are persec@@ uted trees .
the graphics shows how different met@@ adata present themselves . this is a very large representation , as each block of met@@ adata in truth is made of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and cal@@ ender data become properties of all images .
having the keywords - the next section refers to sign@@ ments or comments , the third important tool to catalog your met@@ adata .
you just want to see most of your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographer and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photo .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French mand@@ y 60 years after the landing stage . Wow ! one starts to dream , associations , memories , the historical time period is present again , you might even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who view your photos , the title may possibly be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . just remember the key it &apos;s the importance for the spect@@ ator to transfer Him to help you understand about the mot@@ if you moved your understanding what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a cap@@ tion for itself alone .
with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; you can export any text as much as possible , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , then you can even use a sp@@ elling test . if you want to export your images in Web galleries , then you will need to tell the story to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system . you don &apos;t have to tell the story for the opening of a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet right in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already available with light speed .
the possibilities you can take advantage of Geol@@ ocation is already visible and will be even more profound in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your travel virtually through pictures with geographical data . you can then export the photos at the recording area . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flick@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and refers to the practice of copy@@ rights to remove limitations on distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also applies in all the changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the cutting page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; as information is said :
author ( syn@@ onym for the author and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it wasn &apos;t desired to protect the name of photographer , then the name of a company or organization has been stored , it should not be changed once more . this field neither comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el ( Syn@@ onymous for the publisher ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work @-@ design@@ ation of the photographer . examples of this can be published as : Emplo@@ ye@@ e photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . since this is a note about the Auth@@ oring field , this must be filled just as well .
publisher ( Syn@@ onymous for vendors ) : use the provider for identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the image can be listed here . if the image is an inventory , then the group / agency offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change the solution to this problem . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and mo@@ b professionals this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique per image once . &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
topics : PLAT@@ TEN@@ FE@@ H@@ LER , record fall , electrical supply , ECC , transmission , aging of the storage medium , restoration , red@@ und@@ ancy , recovery period , temperature , data size , common super@@ st@@ itions
of course , we do not talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or fire . this kind of losses they can also happen in traditional pap@@ er@@ pictures or negative effects . in this section , we are talking about problems with the so @-@ called Neue Medien .
bank@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated with more than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in the archive quality , which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . whether you believe it is in your own mess@@ aging .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be read un@@ read@@ able , but you can use this risk in which you store good dis@@ ks and good recording units and are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable . so it turns out to choose the right one .
CDs and DVDs are highly sus@@ cep@@ tible to fail@@ ures , even if you just have written them . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they require by chemical ag@@ eing , ul@@ mar@@ ches light , scr@@ at@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently creates mir@@ acles for CDs and DVDs . it also runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications the def@@ ective data of def@@ ective flo@@ pp@@ ies , HDDs , Flash@@ media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs to win the For@@ mat@@ ant against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost hex@@ agon the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ etary format . then read the data again for you . also if you store the media with a description , date &amp; author . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ pp@@ ings retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing products cover a new disk , but not the data . Google sets out a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives : Dis@@ mis@@ er@@ u@@ die
soon : dis@@ ks will keep going on the longest in temper@@ an area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in lower Temper@@ art@@ es , the error rates are dramatically . electronic parts of the Cont@@ roll@@ ers are the most common fault @-@ item , SM@@ ART can not notice these mistakes . some of SM@@ ART determines the immediate imp@@ ending failure . these are particularly reading and publishing vac@@ ation@@ ers . the expected li@@ fest@@ yles amounts between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss of over@@ load . of course , you can also waste data loss because of a black@@ out before you have backed the files , but these losses may normally be brought back without any major problems .
while most electrical equipment must not do much off , working with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause serious harm . in your computer they can cause serious damage , complete data loss , demol@@ ished mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore , protect yourself before an un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ points is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is part of energy @-@ storage absorbed and the rest explo@@ res . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in coating . but remember that it does not contain any plug @-@ in circuit as well .
if you are looking for an over @-@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care of protecting the protection against flash , and therefore protects the correctly connected devices .
as an over@@ load each cable can use to your computer , you should also pay attention that also all periph@@ er@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms that also provide a telephone connection for your mo@@ dem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ ax@@ ial cable of cable mo@@ dem and TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable transfer protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the mo@@ dem .
while an over@@ thr@@ illing system protects your system from minor fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete drop . even an exhau@@ st of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an inter@@ rupt free electricity supply .
besides the protection from over@@ load , these devices can automatically store cordless energy when a power drop @-@ down . this gives you the opportunity to store your data and use the system automatically . if you buy a US@@ V , then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ load protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concern you to put the potential risk that your b@@ illing system is exposed and , and compare its safety to electricity disorders associated with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ load protection can get you for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you think about your computer that is protected . in conclusion you should always remember all the cable before you go to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup tool for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any data .
they are compared to the hard@@ dis@@ ks , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions therefore are only suitable as a solution against a local loss of data . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . so it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flick@@ r ( Yahoo ) and photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not have any images available in full resolution on Flick@@ r . for $ 25 per year , you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically generated thanks to the TCP / protocol and provided with the big companies in the offer a backup and a distribution memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are pr@@ one to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the database of integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all of these disorders are un@@ discovered that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer transfer than that of your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss , as they can produce interference within the data currents . with normal fil@@ tering , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates that are available with turn@@ around on lower level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ator fil@@ esystem . it is still in the alpha status . it uses the same prot@@ ections using the z@@ fs and is also available for Linux ; it is not yet part of the core .
do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % in operating systems . at not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
loss of data due to viruses is less common than most of the most men think . it is currently limited to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only a few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been seen for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as propri@@ etary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ F@@ s , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to name the spread fil@@ esystem . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investig@@ ating process for a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ specified status will be avoided . if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat of digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the root causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is that while the technology further develops there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and sound @-@ characteristics of all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today cameras go in the direction of the 10 Meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high quality op@@ tics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR Cam@@ ero@@ x have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format Sens@@ ors ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB HDD &apos;s drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so make sure your data is frequently affected by a tab and test the backup before you make any kind of your operating system , the exchange of sheets , or the size of your hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external drive drive . if , then one day , a flash , you are lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster causes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft gra@@ ins : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ ers always means a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stair@@ way , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of loss in spite of the panic disorder . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a full backup of all files which are to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference @-@ assurance : a backup of the files which have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time @-@ points : to the complete assurance and the last differ@@ ing insurance .
incre@@ mental security : a backup of the files which have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time , and this backup comes up to a version of the version . this backup comes from a Ver@@ sion@@ ing system , next to the exception that is only sam@@ pled and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transm@@ issions , ht@@ tp only have the difference of files that have been really changed . this is comp@@ ressed and if you want to increase security through ssh .
secure important images directly after having stored them on your computer to DVD or another op@@ ic medium .
this procedure leaves you enough time to detect losses and restore . at the same time you come for safeguarding but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for every month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you made a complete review .
themes : met@@ adata , in the file @-@ file stored IP@@ TC information , Associ@@ ated X@@ MP files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , recur@@ rent of images and met@@ adata , copy of images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the internet .
so that valuable images survive the next 40 years , that &apos;s about the time span in which you truly are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you must consider everything that is said today with caution and re@@ evaluate the time . unfortunately , there is no other option as a certain w@@ rest@@ y@@ ness to let yourself be compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switching to open standards supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and back@@ yard , or to change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the requirement for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always to grow .
let &apos;s suppose you have entered the scal@@ ability and have put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , whether your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ dc &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ iser@@ vices ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / Mos@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iser@@ vices when needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not have any software more , you can read it yourself . this task will become easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a propriet@@ ory , pat@@ ented format slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it .
PNG , when an open source Standard designed by GI@@ F . it can be more fun , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit and Chrom@@ ebook data . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF , and has a slow motion . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ comp@@ ressed form or in a container by a ver@@ fun@@ free comp@@ pres@@ sion@@ ism ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , this format is adapted to many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digit@@ als Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open pipe format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is designed to use the TI@@ FF / EP format and is obliged to use met@@ adata . a handful of Cam@@ ero@@ ions are now available and we hope that we will use the ri@@ ver@@ ber Canon and Nikon it sometime .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , to replace the &amp; quot ; Ext@@ ensi@@ ble Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic technique , which allows users to use their data into a file itself . the file information is associated with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored the for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers prefer it to origin@@ ate on an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , as it saves the met@@ adata separ@@ ate from the image file and the image file and as mentioned above , the shell format is recorded . therefore , you should think about whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organisation caring for fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , working in a wide range of applications and modeling , discussions and community work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and trans@@ duc@@ tive efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera body , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your systems archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
for a subtle process you can use external programs . if you use the images again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were recorded by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . just export them into we@@ gal@@ erien , co@@ ding you to MPEG , use them in cont@@ acting , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; in section Add a photos to an album you can add a description as you can already add on your hard disk . but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; connect them to the display mode , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it . you will find a further description in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . if the connection is produced , a pig@@ lets appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ ename and a symbol for file attach@@ ments are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera form@@ ations to any entry . with the page , properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog features file properties and the photo information that is saved internally from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that for some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; or picture editing . please note that these met@@ adata are not available for some digital cameras .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to download photos on their machine is the click on the button download and then download the selection from your camera into a single album . . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired options selected by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download the chosen option . the button selected is extended until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option new download is available . these photos were still not marked by &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; in this case the new images are marked with a star in the window display . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded .
when you can download the buttons or download the chosen option , appears a dialog with which you can select the target album , in which the photos are stored , like normal folder , you can read in the section of my albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you chose the finish album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; invites the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , by selecting the button del@@ eting , so you must first select them and delete it off .
note that there is no way of ext@@ ingu@@ ishing photos that you deleted from the camera . therefore , they are completely deleted if the photos were successful in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; -@@ Album were downloaded , before you want to delete them from the camera . if you do the camera hunt , you should do this about the cam@@ er@@ amen , since this is much faster .
cameras often use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not especially meaningful names . the fil@@ ename can normally load again after the photos from the camera was deleted . this can be useful to download the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ ename .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and spi@@ der of the picture and for publication based description . if you use this last option , automatic folder is created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three additional options that are done before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two affect the data on the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the item &amp; time for all loaded images .
if you want a different format format as the standard format , you can use e.g. in the processing field the pre@@ fix Phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % M@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . place the option date &amp; time add . for further adjustments you should read the help of the instruction .
if you use the option cam file , you have the option to change the fil@@ ename in small letters . or in large letter , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val , used for a photo is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the Pre@@ view . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera screen .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time stage in order to complete automatic rotation during the shut@@ down . not all cameras are ready . in the side@@ bar met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information which your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually swit@@ ched , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in its original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , then use the button @-@ width and select the automatic turn in the lower part of the window .
if your camera has made information about the date , where the photo was made available , can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; this sub@@ ver@@ bs are based on image data . all pictures with the same date are available on the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in that case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; the photos directly into the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option and select the option dat@@ e@@ pers at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from their host to her camera is the button download . then select the file dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files up@@ loaded , you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
once the selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; you where the images are to be loaded up . a folder containing dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and press OK to load the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that is indicated in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and that can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be executed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system .
not only for professional photograph@@ ers can link it interesting to link a picture with an accurate geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to mapping an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , police , and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you &apos;ve forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can open with a click on a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; user want to send the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to participate in the position of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data in the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 get many GPS data fields such as , e.g. , semi @-@ trailers and maps . the question is actually more , how the data in these fields are . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via an processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) , and finally on the manual entry of famous places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a couple that works with GPS receiver . either as the map or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS @-@ interface : co@@ y@@ ers@@ Eye I@@ pa@@ q I@@ ke K@@ od@@ ak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ pe Pro G3
downloading of GPS data from a device can be processed with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , this data is stored in the g@@ px format , as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from GPS , and be cor@@ related . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ; Over@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itu@@ dinal or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of rep@@ atri@@ ates coordinates , for example of map@@ s.@@ codi@@ ce .
map@@ s.@@ google.com are not showing European road cards . here are some European sites , at least in french , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tries to give you so much control over his working procedures as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val . to switch to these settings , you must split in the Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .

this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ se and copy@@ righ@@ ted data . these data are automatically generated in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when selecting the database synchron@@ isation , these data is written into the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ it@@ el is a syn@@ onym for publisher : this field should contain the professional design@@ ation of the photographer . this can be ( such as the employee photographer , fre@@ el@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the car @-@ field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to use the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is one for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press ; if the image is a picture @-@ hot , then the group should be available the image or the agency that will be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . this ensures that the met@@ adata are permanent in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; they are imported without getting lost .

the settings of the lumin@@ ous by &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; however , can be swit@@ ched on this page to the standard values . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ized mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the entire image size , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can hereby gain better results results .
by default , the picture editing a black background behind the indicated photos . if you prefer a different color , you can switch it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
Over@@ - and subj@@ ected areas of an image can be selected with dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the picture editing , this View Mode is available with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and be swit@@ ched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ ver@@ pling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of the ligh@@ thous@@ es than in the colour information . please refer to this article in Wikipedia to the near@@ er explanation .
with the setting of PNG squee@@ zing you can reduce the size of PNG files . this surgery does not reduce the image quality , since PNG need a fun @-@ free algorith@@ m . if you have a fast machine , you can put this value on a high comp@@ ression mode . thereby 1 : a low and 9 a high comp@@ ression .
with the option TI@@ FF files comp@@ ressed , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ compressor sal@@ aries for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , as the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ algorith@@ m is working @-@ free .
with the h@@ iring of the list@@ ener JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can pack @-@ free . even if you have written the los@@ sy attitude , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than when normal JPEG . when this paragraph has not yet supported , met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans ; picture editing only for photo concerned was for photos . currently , it is rapidly developing for a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of picture editing .
the set @-@ up is that all green pixels are identical . if the ext@@ ender green pixel of the CCD @-@ sensor should respond to sensitive to ul@@ tra@@ violet light . this option features a minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates but the 2x@@ 2 guit@@ ars with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method .
when this option is set , the white @-@ colour of the camera is used . otherwise , if it is used , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white is not set in . standard is set to use a fixed color balance , which is provided on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . the nam@@ ing of the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ cut@@ ted images in four steps . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the top @-@ point , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ capacity of your camera to look at the edge of your camera . the setting colors will produce some unusual results as they can re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the re@@ movable .
this is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red proportions of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much colour or white you want .
when you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should be customized for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ate value to your taste . you probably have to set it a little higher than standard 1 . this can also be made later in the options of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; -@@ picture editing . to keep the time for the demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should advance conservative .
a hum@@ os@@ a@@ icing -@@ algorith@@ m is a digital image process , which stem from the colour@@ ful image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix colored pixel . this algorith@@ m is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ construction .
&amp; D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives available : bil@@ ing@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it looks like A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorith@@ m that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it makes color art@@ ef@@ acts to the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with a acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ devi@@ ation of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a so@@ iling edge , as you are performed during the pipe .
a profile translate the colour information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; information like the color @-@ bu@@ ys of a color foam in the other are to be transl@@ ating the colours as closely as possible .
behaviour arise if an image is opened in picture editing / color @-@ lab@@ eler module with data files .
you can set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you all save your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; exam@@ ines this folder during the launch .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; Standard@@ squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed in the opening of the raw file .
the shade of paint views is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the whole screen .
the input profiles should fit into the camera unit and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which no colour @-@ tone mapping or g@@ amm@@ ac@@ upun@@ cture . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not need to con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to carry out the tone mapping itself .
there are other options like the soft @-@ proof profile which you can em@@ ulate about how your image would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your camera has a smaller color area as your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . you could manually correct , instead of leaving oneself to the flas@@ hing algorith@@ m of your printer .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious that color profile is provided for them for what is provided . unfortunately , not in the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official :
the Canon ranges can detect the style for the goal : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; cap@@ tions and image processing . by means of this interface it can support &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; many modules support that have been written to work with every program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution being installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the first @-@ click menu .
short commands for tasks that are implemented by modules can be set in the menu using settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can get you using the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper Reg@@ ler regul@@ ates the time between the pictures , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other c@@ ysts turn on the met@@ adata , respectively , which are built at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera properties show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is connected correctly , swit@@ ched and in the image file . currently , here are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) -@@ mass storage c@@ ater from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ els , where you adjust your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; you must connect the camera to your computer , connect them in the display mode .
try out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set up cam@@ er@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after having set up your camera , your camera does appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will display in the menu from the main window . if you own more than a camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option confir@@ ming dialog for the moving of &gt; Images into the du@@ st@@ bin , you can view the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ble ; in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ kl@@ ed by &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any requests . otherwise , you will need to apply changes to the button .
you can also get the indication of the initial meeting of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; with the starter . this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; .
the setting up looking for new photos are forcing and di@@ gi@@ ated ; the basic ord@@ ner to look for new or sol@@ dered albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; . if something came from the base folder , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ came , you whether it should be deleted from the database .
different shades can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can select from settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the designs can be displayed below :
these designs are made in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; to create , you will find more information about this tutorial .

the picture editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules into &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; therefore , you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the picture editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current date number , enlarge , and the current image size indicates .
an menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar to quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of picture editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you save the file stor@@ ing or the button plate from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have stored the image .
so you should possibly create a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with the stor@@ ing file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ produce the image file or the button . you then lose any change that you have carried out in the photo since the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
virtually every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can re @-@ cat@@ chy if you want to work re@@ ver@@ ted or re@@ inst@@ ated by selecting mach@@ ining from the menu .
if you use this frequently you should remember the short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to cat@@ chy and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the tool@@ bar , you can press a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu , all actions in between also will be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started the picture editing you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons , image high , image below or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the current photo , you are asked if you want to store them .
you can play in the photo and perform zo@@ oming in which you are C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar , or the entries in the tool@@ bar .
to adjust a picture of the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging the size :
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view where you use the Es@@ cape key . usually , then the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can re@@ voke this in the intro@@ duc@@ tory dialog of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; this lets you call out of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; main window will display . see the section for setting the picture editing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can select the image file and receive the standard &amp; k@@ de ; pressure dialog . you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print some pictures or entire sent@@ ences . entire picture pages may choose from your selection . you only need to select the images from the standard methods and select from the menu Album printing assistant . if you follow the assistant , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which represents important information and actions available for the selected images . the same page layout is available , even in picture editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab is cli@@ cked :
Multi@@ f@@ aches Click on the same rider lets the side bar appear or go back to the edge disappear .
in the visual view you can insert complaint with unlimited size or insert . please note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are permitted in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters are being formed . if you want to use IP@@ TC leaf@@ y box in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the complaints will then be saved .
in addition to using @-@ button there is one button . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write met@@ adata about the files you have selected always , if you have selected a met@@ adata that is always written in the pictures .
the section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in sou@@ ks and sor@@ cer@@ ers . it can be applied either by a single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars onto the side bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the co@@ ding follows the schem@@ atic in the following table :
the keywords view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keywords , and a box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; -@@ meeting was reported .
the keywords tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the in@@ appropriate key@@ word . you can limit the number of possibilities in searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another step in entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ings of the relevant applic@@ ant fields in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you can select a key@@ word in the sample tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the whole selection , if you want to provide a selection using a key@@ word , please read the section &apos; keywords .
the side of the Del@@ t@@ filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , file , key@@ word and search@@ results . if in addition , one or more key@@ word filter out of the right , will only appear in the cut@@ ters of these two . all key@@ words are available .
you can also drag and drop down . suppose you have selected multiple images to provide you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and then put on the selection . then a dialog , which you ask if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the top example shows the basic window pictures of a calendar day . the keywords is reduced to no keywords , which has reduced the amount to three pictures . they were selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a key@@ word was drawn from the right st@@ utter@@ ing tree to the selection and sent there . a dialogue asks if the key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be displayed under settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule and have created and determine that it would be a or be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which in the database is sought . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can select a Advanced search of all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the c@@ app@@ z@@ box at the end of the rule and then use the kno@@ b . then you will see the options as follows :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly used it &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ designed work@@ flow , the colours will vary from your camera or scanner . with a colour@@ ful work@@ flow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner identical and that suit the colours you want , or on the web publish them from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme is coming to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons , they need for the results he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour administration . in addition , you will find links with deeper information allow your own informed decisions to meet you with the desired result .
if your image work@@ flow meets all of the criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about colour management .
they are working on a monitor based on the s@@ R@@ GB color foam . ( more information can be found below )
your only other image expenditure are per e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB worked so well and life for everybody is so easy , why should we use a different color space and thus have to make thoughts about colors ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ gely @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the thir@@ sty region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dim@@ ensi@@ onale representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so visit Bruce Lind@@ mere excell@@ ente page and click information and then click information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to be tru@@ sive my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB @-@ colour area or not , you need to be tru@@ sive your monitor since s@@ R@@ GB , so that your ; on@@ itor is close to s@@ R@@ GB . therefore you have to monitor your monitor based on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , then you need to either use your monitor to the s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool presents five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve an image in most cases . use it therefore before you try to continue a further manual work .
the functions norm@@ alize , altern@@ ate , automatic , and contrast extend from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ ble automatic correction , try automatically from your colours to make the best . you will be experimenting with these securities , to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the denial instead of the entire image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test dot is as bright as possible without its color sh@@ aded . this feature is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
ab@@ ed : this method regul@@ ates the lumin@@ es@@ cent of the selected picture , so that the hist@@ ogra@@ m of the vo@@ icing unit is as flat as possible . sometimes the ab@@ norm@@ alized results in enhancing the contra@@ sts of a picture , sometimes it produces just tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that creates either mir@@ acles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the color @-@ range in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . they select the dark and bright border @-@ tones and adjust@@ ing the red , green and blu@@ eber@@ ry to the complete Hist@@ ogra@@ m .
contrast extend : this method enh@@ ances the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by the moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a re@@ ji@@ st@@ aging of all values in between . this is only visible when rare images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white cover of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white straight of any photos .
the white @-@ same correction is somewhat limited because over a color foam with 8 @-@ bit each colour is worked . if you can perform too far from the original image , with over@@ exposure , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction is better off .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ aries on copyright protected by Paw@@ el T. Joch@@ ym . they start it on the menu color white white off the picture editing .
the showcase can be adapted to the size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically to the properties of the tool . if you want to see the original white straight , then you can click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the destination photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ator of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the hist@@ o@@ ction .
right up , a Hist@@ ogra@@ m is shown that dynam@@ ically is subject as soon as you change a parameter . this histori@@ ography is very helpful even , even in well illumin@@ ated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ isc@@ ations . with one kno@@ b you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on the shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma @-@ g@@ amma . the shadow Just@@ ine lets you improve or down the shade of your photos .
an@@ alogue with the above controls around , you should use the colour temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the picture shows to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white bla@@ zing . in this way the temperature and green -@@ values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white off with the list of preference . the following settings are available :
the over@@ taking indi@@ k@@ ator increases the colours , when more than a color @-@ channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. they will be shown the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is displayed in the preview as a re@@ model indicator and has no effect on the final image .
buttons are saving and load exactly this . each setting of the whit@@ eboard can be put in a text file and later upload it later .
the button @-@ pres@@ ets keeps all fil@@ ming again on its standard values and the associated neutr@@ als . keep in mind that neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save it , your original image is changed .
you can adjust here the co@@ di@@ er@@ cis@@ es per color @-@ channel of the operated picture . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this co@@ ding also requires more record , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and the assignment of color prof@@ esi@@ cles . colour @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the bri@@ ghtness . a detailed instructions for the use of col@@ ates can be drawn to rate the chapter .
another important tool in the menu is available under colors of key correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you can always use the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction , you will find further information .
one very powerful opportunity to correct exposure solutions is the tool of the Grad@@ ation that you can find under colors Grad@@ ation in the menu .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool color effects puts you four color effects , a solar power @-@ effect , a ne@@ via filter , a ne@@ on @-@ effect and a cant@@ onal filter at your disposal .
in times of chemical processing , solar pol@@ ari@@ zation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of the first developed pressure replaced by the additional light . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were revers@@ ed by the second ill@@ um@@ ination . the result was a part @-@ neg@@ atively negative of the picture . this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fine .
the intensity checks the solar power . at approximately 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase is finally a negative image , that so do not appear on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy se@@ ff@@ ed . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vivi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that makes it a stronger contro@@ vers@@ y effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simple , it emb@@ ell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the flag@@ ship for one on the day light of the F@@ UJ@@ IF@@ IL@@ M . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color with day@@ light and high contra@@ sts . the character@@ ization make him a film of choice for nature photograph@@ ers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color are also some picture grap@@ hist@@ s , specifically those who hardly see landscapes flour@@ ished , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates the contrast to the contra@@ sts of the result . the parameter Level controls the bri@@ ghtness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . with great pictures the filter can choose the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ common that you want to correct the shade of your photos with the tools in the menu subject to colors . all your uti@@ lities can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the revers@@ ed problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for bri@@ ghtness will reduce it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if it please , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Grad@@ ation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ ement / contrast / Gamma is the tool key correc@@ tor to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need for the use of the sli@@ der . more concrete , the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s .
the window contains a graph@@ s of the Int@@ ensity values , a hist@@ o@@ grams , the active Can@@ als or the selected en@@ closures . beneath the graph@@ s are three sli@@ der into the inside and which can be del@@ ayed to change the Int@@ ensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn to use is the Reg@@ ulators to move and take care of how the image changes .
on the right hand side the original and preview of the image can be viewed dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this box @-@ box can be set to whether the hist@@ o@@ grams with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis is frequently present . for pictures of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogra@@ m is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic entrance is useful .
three shelves : the top one for the dark T@@ ones , the middle for the bright sounds and the lower for the middle sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ ys .
the three shades can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadow , middle and bright sounds automatically . in addition , there is a kno@@ b for fully automatic et@@ ting .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field . there are also two shelves that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the comp@@ ression of output levels can e.g. create a hidden picture as a background while getting slightly different in the foreground .
automatic : with this kno@@ b the images are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and loading : with these buttons , the entries can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ loaded , the Gimp is used format .
when you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input values will automatically be read@@ ed for all shadows , medium and sun notes . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the extension of the original set of the hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ s for rot@@ - , green , blue and ar@@ umin@@ ous channels .
the option over@@ loading indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color @-@ channels to find over @-@ coated pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left the half of the original and the target image is displayed dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this box allows the channel to specify the canal that is modified by the module :
besides this box , two symbols are found around between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for paintings produced with a digital camera , the linear mode is most useful . for pictures with large sections of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode is further .
if you move for example a c@@ ator to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds with dar@@ ker extracts and that the image image becomes dark .
the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ ings on the area you want to change it will be a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move on and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and loading : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each turn which you created can now be saved in fil@@ esystem and later be loaded . the file format for that is Gimp &apos;s cur@@ vy format .
if you create this method and the three colour chain buttons , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun notes . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve .
the option over@@ loading indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over @-@ coated pixels . if available in more than one channel , you get the combined result . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo that has been fixed in L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ al . shadow and sun @-@ notes was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the cur@@ ves . the original image is ( 1 ) and correc@@ t@@ ened ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another high @-@ evol@@ ving tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colours channel mix@@ er of image editing .
with the selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ o@@ grams : this gives you a first note like you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and failure . the le@@ ft@@ ist area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be regarded as compared to its own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the hist@@ ogra@@ m to show you the corresponding shade .
the controls for the module are right down : Reg@@ ler for red , Green and Construction allow you to blend these channels . if you can also keep L@@ umin@@ ous , since the channel mix@@ er then becomes DAS tool to generate great black / white con@@ versions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portrait .
sometimes , especially if you mix Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , manages the reduction of a color to a visible smok@@ es which comes from color . color does not occur at the same place in the colour can@@ als and whose sound pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the drain first .
the Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any number bl@@ ender h@@ iring you can save it for later and then load . the file format is channel @-@ channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ loading indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color @-@ channels to find over @-@ coated pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue Channel has been re@@ designed . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and to see the image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your level of abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photographs , black / white , since paint images can be converted into the calcul@@ ator . also with a set of clips .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford F@@ P@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white filter coating with a green lin@@ ens filter . this looks great , in all the scene images , and fits in particularly well with portra@@ its of the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ges : sim@@ ulated a black / white film coated with a orange str@@ um@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scen@@ eries and air pictures . so much like the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ th@@ ter .
red filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white filter coating with a red lin@@ ens filter . this creates a dramatic decision @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate moon @-@ light on the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulated a black / white filter coating with a yellow Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural color tone and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle sounds , while he adds a bit col@@ dness in the shadow of a dru@@ pes and the recovery in a Sep@@ i@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to E5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a col@@ ouring or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the bull of an old master , a pop style portrait out of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the men@@ ding image image of texture can be used for it .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the s@@ emb@@ lance of depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the picture .
a paper writer is applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder into the limits of a picture is not an easy task . one possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative setting . this is a psychological barrier to the asp@@ iring eye . under picture frames , the module can be started from image editing .
type : with this parameter , you create the desired amount of cream for your image . covered with a thin line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , Ab@@ dul@@ et sh@@ ep@@ ed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a kno@@ ck @-@ effect and decorative insert a decorative frame with patterns .
width : reduces the width of the frame in percent . the width is width from 1 % to 50 % .
that with the scope of decorative pieces will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a form@@ att@@ ed text in a picture of any place . this also goes to multiple places if you need it .
this tool is intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use tex@@ tures , orientation , color out of color foam and drawing with its characteristics as you need . you &apos;ll just choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ cau@@ ti@@ ous background . already the image is ready .
any setting that you have chosen for your text may change until you press to the button &quot; OK . once the image has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool content you can apply a template about an image .
the image image into image processing can be used to put on a picture .
for the Stencil , there are no limitations on the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG format and should work with maximum comp@@ ression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size ; thus , you simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; Mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ val @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your plug @-@ in @-@ folder with the kno@@ b . please choose the folder in which you have to copy the documents . these settings will be marked for the next start .
after the root folder for the st@@ enc@@ ils being set , appears a determination which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of a folder updates the pre@@ views of the st@@ enc@@ ils automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnific@@ ation factor and position of your picture .
enlarge : this button is magni@@ fied the underlying picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
crus@@ hing : this kno@@ w@@ led the underlying image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the image to the whole image , you must decrease the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse kno@@ b .
moving this button to move the image below the image below . take the image and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then adjust automatically to the visu@@ als .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; makes three different tools available for bow@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ds . it is very fast and easy , but specially created in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
Un@@ shar@@ fe mask is working on the contrast of the edges to let a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it works rather psych@@ ov@@ is@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmosph@@ eric dun@@ geon and it really makes a really good job . the algorith@@ m was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
Ref@@ oc@@ ussi@@ es is perhaps the best of the three , as it really improves the sle@@ ves . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without attention as well as most digit@@ ised images require a correction of the shar@@ p@@ ness . this is due to the dig@@ itali@@ zation process colors with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras require normally more det@@ ri@@ mental shar@@ pen@@ ing than regular cameras for the private user .
in JPEG images it is often applied for a camera of internal testing . on the contrary , pictures in the pipe @-@ format will always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during the processing .
some scanner apply a shar@@ eholder value already during the reading of the picture . if you activate this , you will get in control of your image .
in some situations , you may need usable results by raise a photo with the pair of shar@@ pen@@ ises . you can re@@ voke the men@@ stru@@ p menu with the men@@ stru@@ p menu .
however , you should deal with caution because the outcomes are not very natural : the tough@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the needed technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing a picture of chor@@ o@@ idal hem@@ ost@@ ers . you can find more information about the men@@ chor@@ us of chor@@ us @-@ chor@@ us . below ref@@ ut@@ ches you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shooting .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it increases . use the tool to switch mark with the menu item cor@@ rigi@@ ble and experimenting something with settings . the window display on the right of this dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the th@@ umb@@ nails will help edit the picture . the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . standard values often produce good results and should first try out . an increase in radius or amount reinforce the effect . if you make the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness mask , the noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges .
the radius is like many pixels in each side of a edge by the filter are affected . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ adores . you should therefore break pictures of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red image added to the original . thereby the strength of the shar@@ p@@ ness is set .
the sw@@ elling value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the use of difference . you can thus define a minimum difference to the edge of filters . in this way , these areas are avoided with a soft switch between the killing of the tough@@ en and therefore beauti@@ full f@@ law in fac@@ ulty , des@@ ks and water @-@ surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mascul@@ ine filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . sharp shift was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sw@@ elling = 0.0 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool of Ref@@ oc@@ ussi@@ es ref@@ illed a picture by improving the shar@@ p@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected un@@ folding filters -@@ algorith@@ m of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries one image to &amp; quot ; ref@@ oc@@ ussi@@ an quot ; in which it makes a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . this is a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of Un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed Mas@@ ke . Ref@@ oc@@ ussi@@ es reached usually better results as bl@@ ur@@ red mask . you can launch it from the menu by calling colors ref@@ illed within the image .
in practice , the circular lo@@ oms works far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung eine produces a very long tail , which is far from the original sources . the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very heavily from the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular wheels : this is the radius of circular lo@@ ops . it is the key parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures should put the default value 1 good results . you can put a higher value when your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red then but to Heiligen@@ sch@@ eine .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help reducing art@@ ef@@ acts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; remote and versatile . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ p@@ ative effect of the module .
Rau@@ sch@@ filter : an increase in the sh@@ aker can help you to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0,1 % is too low . however , the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will gradually f@@ aded the image further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe : this is the case for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche Sch@@ är@@ fe . use this parameter if your in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sch . in most cases , you should leave this value on 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts , so you might also have to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the rough filter .
die pattern : this value determines the size of the transformation dium . an increase in the die @-@ size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular archipelago or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s Sch@@ är@@ fe . however , however , that the module can be very slow if you choose great values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stor@@ ing als and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any of the ref@@ illed parameters you have set will be stored for later and can be loaded for later .
try all cuts , color and vo@@ icing structures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much sur@@ geri@@ es changes that are not immediately visible , but left later in@@ convenient arti@@ facts .
if you can read and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ comp@@ ressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mask produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ds . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as a shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theoretically , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king always has to produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness . for the Wiener Filter s , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters are always at least as good as the Un@@ shar@@ fe mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better with the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ sharp color @-@ image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attri@@ but@@ able to insufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
for more information on the methods of raising ec@@ re@@ structure in digital paintings , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the Reg@@ ler Gl@@ ät@@ te sets the bl@@ ur@@ red@@ ness of the en@@ qu@@ ished in order to generate a natural wick@@ edness .
the color @-@ tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the p@@ up@@ set . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction is one of the most highly developed tool to remove the desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ compatible algorith@@ m was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets than starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the fil@@ tering orders , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a even bu@@ zz@@ led over the picture . whereas larger value leads mainly homogen@@ eous regions , smooth@@ ed and details . a value of 0,9 should be ancho@@ red in detail . please note that the details are always refer@@ enced .
draft ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only in one direction . if you have a movie star@@ ters or CCD set @-@ up will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best with a value close to 1 re@@ moves .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum humidity factor above all es. p then defines the relative humidity . place this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is expected , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it must be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : returns how often the algorith@@ m is crossed . normally , here 1 or 2 is out .
Winkel@@ ho@@ Wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : Angl@@ ed integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small for a long run . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral St@@ ride width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral St@@ ride width in pixels . you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixels @-@ smooth@@ ing and never exceed 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More that you receive by selecting this option is only small . it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow it to happen .
buttons are saving as a store and shop accurately . every setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later be re@@ loaded again .
image error messages compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load for itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b@@ out .
below you can see how image bug with baby Art@@ ef@@ acts may be corrected . the module is made on a photo that in Guatemala city with an analog camera was made , as you see there is a pecu@@ liar black arti@@ fact p@@ act in the foreground , that is caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image smok@@ es . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool presents sel@@ ectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ory from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor drives , so you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screens@@ hot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the standard settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is required for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can wi@@ red the image . the above radius moves about the image and the color in it becomes smooth and thus minor errors .
shar@@ p@@ ness : controlled the shar@@ pen@@ ed body . this value sets the point of the filter to the front to determine the se@@ aling changes . if the value is increased , smoking c@@ als can change . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and sm@@ aking or decor@@ ate it again .
edges : controlled the edge @-@ precision for the shar@@ p@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it &apos;s too strong does not occur the entire ro@@ cket or smoke @-@ whe@@ ads may occur . put it at a value near the max@@ im if you want to remove a w@@ aking or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing more details .
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the picture . we recommend that you either change the colour or lumin@@ ance in order to improve a picture . these settings not affect the smooth@@ ing process controls through the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color toler@@ ances of the picture . we recommend that you either change colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the controlling process of the image .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amer intoler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dark areas , which are typically boo@@ sted to increase . it is dirty , however also the shadow spher@@ es .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controlled the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ oid compound . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive fil@@ e@@ radius occurs due to variations of the lumin@@ ous density , if it is too high can occur a poll@@ uting . if he can occur to his minimum , sp@@ lash and ph@@ ema can occur and is the recommended method for it .
loading and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters are used for smoking reduction which you have set can be stored in fil@@ esystem and later be charged .
this is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life . the original image is associated with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ tive with ( 2 ) is applied with the standard settings .
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to increase . use this tool to draw the soft@@ mark with the menu item cor@@ rigi@@ ble and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the window display on the right side of the dialogue can see the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most highly developed tools to decrease photo@@ graphic record .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility of removing a lot of undes@@ irable art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s ro@@ cket , scr@@ at@@ ches , comp@@ ression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or det@@ ri@@ mental images , which makes the content as well as the human eye .
the same algorith@@ m can be used for color and tex@@ tual composition . the Tex@@ process correction is performed with another tool , the image error correction , the algorith@@ m for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ l and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts : the comp@@ ression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a comp@@ ression des@@ perate jacket , he produces some comp@@ ression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ comp@@ ressed image . this attitude should correct these issues .
buttons are stor@@ ing as and shop accurately . every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ like rou@@ ches . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensation of 3200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gr@@ itt in the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and correc@@ t@@ correc@@ tions under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo @-@ restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the Scan Art@@ ef@@ acts created by the scanning light and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; tool kit permits hot text of photos that with a CCD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PEG@@ Pix@@ i project , who are protected by copyright Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG comp@@ ression to have an built @-@ in oppression for hot pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this tool can be used to remove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name Pixel@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ Pixel@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright Pixel@@ quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; there are currently no manu@@ als method to select the bad pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ards with the kno@@ ck . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you have to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the proper milk image to a correc@@ tive image . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note here that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads in the next session .
the image area and the th@@ umb@@ nails will help you correct the result within the image . the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all areas of view .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels in the preview and results of the fil@@ ters . then choose the best filter method to cross this pixel blocks . these are the available filter :
Dur@@ b@@ schnitt : it is designed to determine an average of the thi@@ eves . the resulting color will be al@@ located in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels with a distance from 1 of the pixel block will have drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ lin@@ ear@@ en surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of linear cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to pixel block will be de@@ duc@@ ted to calculate a bi @-@ quad@@ r@@ atic surface ( 1 @-@ DIM ) or a group of square met@@ ven ( 1 @-@ DIM ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cu@@ bic : all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be appro@@ ached by a bi @-@ cu@@ bic surface ( 2 @-@ DIM ) or a group of Cub@@ an cur@@ ves ( 1 @-@ DIM ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ish the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot @-@ text correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ing , applied . the original image has been enlarged by 300 % ( 1 ) and corrected photo is below ( 2 ) to see .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Vign@@ et@@ etics is a tool to correct the vig@@ of , that is , sub@@ ordin@@ ate corners , one image to correct .
vast@@ ness lenses , in particular those in middle and large photo format , can often be illumin@@ ated the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture ; in fact , the light can reduce the sensor there .
but it also has dis@@ advantages . many centre filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . Wi@@ thin objective , also with center @-@ filters , an opening of f / 16 or less use , because otherwise un@@ shar@@ p@@ aging effects arise by movement .
with the major exposure areas of today &apos;s film@@ strip and film @-@ scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ valence transformation triggered by a c@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorith@@ m is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting of the vig@@ our and with three other regul@@ ators , you can control the objective of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the level of light extraction at the point of the largest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting of an optical filter with a bl@@ ending attitude of 1 , or by chance to compens@@ ate with a greater degree of vig@@ net , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
leu@@ k@@ ick@@ ness , contr@@ ab@@ ast and g@@ amma @-@ orders : the be@@ ating of an image with the vig@@ our of the pixels . you need to re@@ use the expos@@ ing of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator must provide you only positive values because you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re @-@ read@@ just@@ ing of the way@@ side of the target , then let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the Grad@@ ation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture editing from the menu color Grad@@ ation .
this is an example of the Vign@@ et@@ ting @-@ correction to an image . the original image ( 1 ) indicates the reflec@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correc@@ tive image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction is also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val was a tool to fix the effect of spher@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m of David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . colored dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gr@@ ades covers the general geomet@@ rical dist@@ or@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or counter @-@ witch shape of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third wheel has a similar round@@ trip effect , flat but to edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the Ko@@ efficient fourth Gr@@ ades corrected the remote corners , opposite to the second gr@@ ades . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ ric car@@ ts nearly eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion second gr@@ ades . with negative values can be corrected and positive values of con@@ scientious obj@@ ection .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ or@@ tion fourth gr@@ ades . this value appears stronger in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Cor@@ ners parameters changed the sign of the parameter .
Zoom : this value added the image size new and thereby performs a correction of the first gr@@ ades through . negative values scale while positive the image dimin@@ ished .
clear : this value constra@@ ined the bri@@ ghtness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the bri@@ ghtness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best fil@@ tering orders , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the dist@@ or@@ tion @-@ evaluation . the values that you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the tonn@@ - or pin@@ ion correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . best carry out this correction as every first through . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a tonn@@ ell@@ ular correction , the effect is obvious to the Fal@@ se .
to help you find the best correction is provided that this tool provides a vertical and horizontal support line . move it to an important place , such as the marine edge or a building wall , inside your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this point . afterwards , you can fix the tonn@@ - / con@@ scientious obj@@ ection with the help of lines .
when you correct a con@@ scientious obj@@ ection , the resulting image black corners . you can transform them with the cutting tools in the menu using the image processing or using the Zoom regul@@ ator of this dialogue .
for most pictures , the tonn@@ ell@@ ular correction is made of . the next logical step for some motives , e.g. photographs from the front , frames and paintings , it is the perspective that all angles in the image 90 degrees . note this when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight dist@@ or@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of a tonn@@ ell@@ ular correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and corrected image below ( 2 ) to see .
the algorith@@ m is based on a method of sim@@ ulating Infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u@@ .org Website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensor range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you look at the red rectang@@ le with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters , fil@@ ing and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option add to the fine texture of a high @-@ sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of the gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows will be white as snow !
as the filter colour can be managed to re@@ produce Infra@@ structure film , especially the Grün@@ kan@@ al does not make sense the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of infr@@ ared @-@ filters is applied to a landscap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was put to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the sh@@ re@@ ws .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter fil@@ ing is a simple to use the tool to re@@ produce fine gra@@ ins on your images such as the B / W K@@ od@@ ak Tri @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , combining the manufacturer great silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the photo material .
the film phenomenon consists of your photo a certain mood , or seems to move back into the past . that the picture gets a tim@@ eless atmosphere dis@@ solved from daily life . if you want this particular , gallery @-@ like , gra@@ ined picture , gran@@ ular sight , so you need to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be adjusted to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the Kör@@ ner calibr@@ ated . the default value is , although higher values need to be required , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more Kör@@ ner , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film camera screen based on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity correspond to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorith@@ m from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ata , filter oil painting , gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting . nature pictures and style live are good for this effect .
there are two shelves to influence this effect . the above cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick@@ er brus@@ hes are better suited for large pictures . smooth reli@@ es the g@@ aps , or , seen from the other side , the sle@@ ep@@ iness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the edited is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and glasses 17 .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter coal drawing is used in color and int@@ ens@@ ities to generate a coal output . therefore , pictures whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you &apos;d chosen to outline , which scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the above Reg@@ ler cho@@ oses the foundation size and the lower adjust@@ ing the contrast ( glass ) .
this is an example of the coal @-@ pass filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changing picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by changing the intensity .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it is st@@ amp@@ ed in wax . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; filter gra@@ ving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important on the content . the filter makes the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ dar@@ ily landscape .
the depth allows the contrast of filters to set . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and processed image ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of dist@@ orted effects . it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and let it look like if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft 2 : an@@ alogue to the Wave blocks 1 will dist@@ orts the image here in a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the kno@@ ck .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by Un@@ shar@@ fe Eff@@ ects . it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom Un@@ p@@ ness : caught the image along the s@@ layer lines going out by a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ shar@@ p@@ ness a zo@@ om@@ end camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of many times in the sport photography .
radi@@ al dis@@ shar@@ p@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image through rotation of the pixels by a center . this sim@@ ulates the tough@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal capacity : compar@@ ing the image to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back in the background .
motion for movement : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of a linear movements , z : B : off a car or train , camera .
smo@@ other stret@@ cher : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image soft to the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is made with a dre@@ amy and sh@@ iny soft focus ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portra@@ its , gl@@ am@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle gl@@ aring .
shock @-@ shar@@ p@@ ness : compar@@ ably the image through the random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ p@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary camera .
smart gri@@ pe : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and caught it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectang@@ le cells and then created it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the kno@@ b .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorith@@ m .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the tro@@ p . as the comfort size doesn &apos;t grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and the density of drops . Fisch@@ au@@ gen changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
you can head with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture editing a range free from shelves . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which should be free to choose . if you exit the filter rain drops , the area will remain free of rain drops .
this is an example of the umbrella term . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it by Spi@@ eg@@ s or turning into the right orientation . the tools can also be transformed into the menu and transform mir@@ rors .
photo bu@@ bb@@ les definitely is one of the most highly developed tools to grow a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
one picture to waste is simple . the big question is how you can get an image bu@@ bb@@ les and the details fail ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorith@@ m that is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to change the size uses a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to adjust the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorith@@ m photo was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the GRE@@ C CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say to the tool like you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the new size ratio is maintained with the input of the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is expected , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons can be used as a text file , which can be used as text file and later be loaded again .
photo bu@@ bb@@ les is very fast at what it makes , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself . you can cancel calculation at any time with the kno@@ ck .
you can see below an example for photo bu@@ bb@@ les by wi@@ res a small color @-@ picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enhancement to compare .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a often under@@ estimated tool to create an image . the picture editing allows you to simply cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectang@@ le , create . you will see this rectang@@ le then while you &apos;re moving the mouse .
when you leave the mouse again the area of the photo is cut off , the area of the photo is cut off . you can change the size of the area by changing at the corners of the rectang@@ le . you can create a new rectang@@ le by simply drag it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the in@@ cis@@ ion , use the button bar button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file stor@@ ing or the stor@@ ing file under the menu file to save the scratch photo .
in the hall@@ ways you can change the size of the rectang@@ le by changing the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , that you have defined in a dialogue will remain intact .
in the tool aging ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format is assigned to the width .
the tool to make aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are centi@@ meters , in@@ ch or some other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and the aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , there are two buttons for selecting automatically horiz@@ ont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
down in dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to the section for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation , set .
the tool By side @-@ ratio saves the settings depending on the orientation @-@ orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Vertical ) . if you use the fitting tool for the next time , those settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data retri@@ eves the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the assem@@ bling aid enable them to help you put your pictures better together . these aid are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious sub@@ missions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ thirds , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are the possibility of a rectang@@ le in a similarly harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles oriented towards the di@@ agon@@ als .
Golden middle : the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth pattern , such as the co@@ il of a Nau@@ til@@ us Musch@@ el or the flo@@ wering of a sun bl@@ ume . it emerg@@ es in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden split is the irr@@ ational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who used their tem@@ ples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have assembled the golden division in all times when you put your paintings , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden center . one composition that is usually follows as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious .
the golden centre makes liquid @-@ lines available if you put an image . these aid are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring your goal to achieve good results for your photos . in comparison to the Third Party , the golden spiral generates a liquid place that can follow through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow .
another rule is called the rectang@@ le of the golden Spir@@ ale , also called golden rectang@@ le . there should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden Tri@@ angles is also guided by the top of the golden Spir@@ ale . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . di@@ agon@@ ale can put into these lines can have a static building dynam@@ ical appeared .
when you use the triangle to break up your frame , you create an effect of placing professional photograph@@ ers dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry . try to put your image focal on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tr@@ inity . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options Horiz@@ ontal reflect and Vertical patterns can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic particles .
with the kno@@ b , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture of many colours and a high contrast , the Help lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current picture .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to turn a picture to turn any angle .
if you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to adjust the camera not exactly ver@@ tically or horiz@@ ont@@ ally . this creates an image in which the things turned around a angles . you can fix this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture editing and tool @-@ free rotation . you can also transform your rotation , and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the fe@@ ver angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can put the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the top right .
to help your help , the module is Free Rot@@ ation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to position the two lines . after you set it on a left mouse button . now adjust the angle just as described in previous sections .
after you have fil@@ med a picture you will find unwanted rings in the corners . one way to fix this is to transform the function transform it to make use of the picture editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is Automatic . select one of the following options :
the option anti @-@ ali@@ asing put the image a bit after the rotation . however , consider the ob@@ liter@@ al warning .
all prospec@@ tive transform@@ ations are conducted by a fixed point in the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red quad@@ ru@@ ts at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including clean areas which have been created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including clean areas which have been created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle on degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the top : displays the current angle on degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle on degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the bottom : shows the current angle on degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjustment of perspective the image becomes a little bit dirty . for an individual adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments generate an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you p@@ aired the perspective , you get un@@ free three @-@ sided holes in the corners . one way to depri@@ ve this is the picture with transforming from the image processing .
the tool system is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rectang@@ le is converted into a parall@@ el@@ ogra@@ m . you can transform this module over transform .
configure your image by using the horiz@@ ont@@ als angle and the vertical angle . you can press horiz@@ ont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you press preference to zero , the angle on zero will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target are displayed right from the preview .
to your assistance will end a vertical and horizontal line . move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the activation tool to adjust your image .
after which you have carried out the she@@ ar , the image becomes a bit dum@@ b . for a single shift , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two cases are consumed at twice as much ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the shift , the picture has an un@@ beautiful tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transforming from the image processing .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ lied with . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ;
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site . however , they will always present JPEG and TI@@ FF .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; shows only files in formats on the familiar list . this happens with the file extension and a comparison of those using a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file re@@ ments . you can generally change the list of file re@@ ments ; can be found in the section configuration for more information .
virtually all digital cameras stored photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format used . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; supports both formats .
image comp@@ ression is the application of data comp@@ ression analysis to digital pictures . thereby red@@ und@@ ant information is reduced , in order to save the image data on an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results as JPEG for the same comp@@ ression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the pipe format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Col@@ our . you can read raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the pipe conver@@ ter of &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; in section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ came ; supports downloading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats used by Dave Coff@@ in ; supported by :
many digital cameras will support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG @-@ format ; but if you click on a movie file , then you can click on a movie file ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies to start playing the program to play .

the K@@ IP@@ I module imported into a number of images in a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth .
if you change the steps 4 and 5 you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white off .
many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; included . your description follows here .
all machine vision tools such as sle@@ eves , so@@ call@@ ous , s@@ unter@@ ression , sharp shift , sharp shift , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter appears to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture fin@@ ed ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress beams displays the status of the filter to the current picture . links from him will allow five buttons to change the default mode of the lead @-@ area . these modes are :
vertical without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected fore@@ front .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area displays the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected fore@@ front .
vertical . the left area displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area displays the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the pre@@ view area and if not the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show Over@@ - and sub @-@ expos@@ ures . the colors used can be adjusted in the general introduction page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of Pre@@ view . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and take on the part of the image , which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is an aid and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all settings from the last use of the module are marked .
the side bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ates from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .

&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : is a KDE @-@ program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are available in science , particularly in the inform@@ atics . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ Program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z program , are according to the view of the author &apos;s author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programmes with only a few features .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : project has set itself the goal of re@@ placing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : is a KDE @-@ program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; the programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : shows graph@@ s with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; GUI ; -@@ Program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s newly calculated and in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer )
menu to open the graph@@ s into &amp; Kate ; to open or open the graph@@ s into &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component
load of large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack in order to represent more than these k@@ not )
more required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Program , which required the &amp; graph@@ ite ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s . required in detail :
the main window indicates the opening graph , each in a separate sub@@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; without a argument , the tool@@ bar open only the icon file and the ( blank ) list susp@@ ally opened files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screens@@ hot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this summary with the context menu , or select this position automatically .
use the cur@@ sor ( high and r@@ pm without any special @-@ buttons , left and right at pressing &amp; alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file is currently changed into &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; loaded file from another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graphics will be re@@ loaded , or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , your decision will also remember , so later as a procedure . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the men@@ uit@@ em Sett@@ ings menu item , see also .
when you open a graph@@ ite file outside of a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer , an instance , &amp; eg ; in a file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer : -@@ instance , or want to represent the graph@@ ing graph@@ s in a sub @-@ window of the already ongoing instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at the program start you can let all graph@@ s of your last meeting come back again . again , you can store your choice as well as later .
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided onto several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
when you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of graph@@ s are coming onto a page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the parts of the graph .
side preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with another font
the page once again offers the possibility to set the behaviour when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behaviour ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time .
the site opens the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ ed ; if a graphic is opened outside of a running session . you can set a standard behaviour in this case ( the graph@@ s open in a new window , or in a window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is being consul@@ ted .
the side seating management gives the possibility of specify the starting @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer . you can set a standard behaviour ( the files of the last meeting or not ) or determine if any one is asked for it .
the context menu , normally with a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; appears , opened other possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ s ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries are as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ algorith@@ m , the standard for stra@@ ined graph@@ s . he produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of stra@@ ined graph@@ s . the algorith@@ m puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as brief edges and as a few edge di@@ versions as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; -@@ algorith@@ m is the standard for un@@ used graph@@ s . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spr@@ ing@@ feder@@ model . he uses the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai @-@ algorith@@ m , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; -@@ algorith@@ m creates for un@@ used graph@@ s a jumping @-@ model model . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ hy@@ rist@@ ik , and involves a multi @-@ trigger trigger for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ ster graph@@ s .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; -@@ algorith@@ m describes the k@@ not circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain di@@ agrams of multi @-@ cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog , in which you can specify a layer where command will be executed by a shell and the calculated layout of graph@@ s will be present in the x@@ dot format . with such a layer , you can give specific options , or also change the graph@@ s with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed , or un@@ executed ) and uses the standard algorithms for the respective type at ( dot ; for stra@@ ined , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ reported graph@@ s ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows GPS @-@ coordinates in the met@@ adata of a picture and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF Ver@@ des of the picture and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to geographic areas geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical system , which is used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lat@@ itude are used .
to feature your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert data for you from your GPS equipment .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
choose the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to load a possible cor@@ relation about time and loc@@ alization by you , you have to load a track file with G@@ P@@ X file . of course , this file contains of course data the short time at the same places were included , as the pictures of your camera .
when the file loaded a automatic cor@@ relation that shows the coordinates in red . GPS Track data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore it must be calculated with the time zone . this can be done with time zone . place your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ er@@ eit . is the devi@@ ation below , the data is mer@@ ged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have a trace data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the pictures . the difference of 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all pictures in this field .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have a suitable data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ating difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be set with this dialog manually . this is useful when you have a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog provides the coordinates from one call to the next notice you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the loc@@ alization can also be found and set accordingly . choose the relevant region and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ Leadership to have achieved this again and again , the height must always be selected manually . the card can be swit@@ ched between card , satellite images and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data on the images . here is a small script used to accommodate a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01 . you can choose the albums that can be exported as HTML pages . the char@@ set will be U@@ TF @-@ 8 co@@ ded to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows to select all the albums created according to HTML . you need to select these albums . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically displayed . with the three buttons on your right you can quickly appear a large number of albums . in this area , the Al@@ ben@@ schau and the text of the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image is created a page where the image is displayed . if you then click on a picture , the image is displayed directly with your standard view , &amp; eg ; Cu@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the tab album defines the settings when and how the gallery will be stored with all your corresponding pictures . to do this , choose one folder on which you have writing your permission . a sub @-@ folder containing the name KI@@ PI@@ HTML@@ File , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other col@@ ouring depth , you can change the standard color . which naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the tab listing allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the pictures , these are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages the window will not automatically be closed . therefore , you can see the programme messages , in order to determine if bugs occurred during the generation . the web browser is automatically displayed in order to view the gallery preview . press closing around the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ betra@@ chter is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture above allows him to view a selection of images and execute on them base operations such as shooting , zo@@ oming or push . the observer is ab@@ sent with short images and folders . it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed as standard in the full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without any of your quality .
this module allows to save images in the JPEG format , images in the JPEG format , without the usual losses in quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of the los@@ ure storage is it that the file size increases , since no comp@@ ression of the color @-@ information is held . this can be found e.g. at the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that you can combine your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org. Author : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ liste @-@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import and function of the met@@ adata mod@@ ul@@ s you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file dialog with which you can copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied to the button OK .
this function does not work with all educational formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not to write any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the module MPEG ko@@ di@@ erer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , using a defined length , to convert . this module makes use of packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV der Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can choose a background color for the slideshow . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the media , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG @-@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can set up the extras MPEG @-@ asch@@ au set up the module .
the images selected by you are put on image files in the portfolio . you can also change the s@@ orting of images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely be the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which is shown in seconds . the speed of the picture above will be specified below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and the path of the created file you can set among the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . therefore , you can reserve the extension mp@@ g possible .
if you provide an audio file under name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after you can adjust all settings to your wishes , you can catch a cup of coffee with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back again .
if a hint appears that body scanner or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the button below right below .
the printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper together in standard print sizes . the combined images can also automatically print with the image editing . this is e.@@ g : sensible to improve your or with the Gimp module to direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import your in the raw @-@ format stored images in one of three formats , JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the Command Pro@@ cra@@ w instrument d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : expect the same results as the software from your comrades . sometimes get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted , and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ image conver@@ ter window appears in mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can see the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re@@ use the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether camera orders for the white can be used . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , bri@@ ghtness and red / blue ampli@@ fier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour controller can be selected so you can use the contrac@@ ted information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the release result . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorith@@ m and produces the smallest file formats .
the Tagged Image format , TI@@ FF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ ure LZ@@ H comp@@ ression .
if you prefer to process your images frequently or you &apos;ll later continue using the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you want to select JPEG as storage format the met@@ adata present in the RAW @-@ file are stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings you can start with the exit button . if you want to cancel the process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the for@@ kli@@ fts mechanism allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode once you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically re@@ sign the existing file . however , a preview is not available . however , a preview is not available at how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ressed all images in one album . it also uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming of all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Start@@ ular and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it is used to convert the first program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can enlarge or enlarge the image . four types of change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size changes in a dimension . the width or height of the image gets automatically , depending on the picture @-@ orientation , selected . aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : compare size in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for e.g. to adjust your image to screen .
not proportional : dis@@ proportion@@ ate scale changing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed on this option .
printing preparation : prepare the image for the photo@@ graphic press . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ pers . the target image , including background size , random size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of your printed images in advance . additional pictures can be drawn on the list of the coming pictures and show it there .
after having started the module , the image window will display images from you with the selected images . you can add additional pictures to the selected images . for the most recently displayed image , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and insert it there to add it to the images below .
with the kno@@ b images the selected images will be removed from the list of the coming pictures .
once you have selected all images , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject directly here . the pictures selected by you are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many pictures to once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of emails . there may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and every time is used till you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer previously . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are put together into a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photographs , but it is best adapted to the los@@ ure products such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you to JPEG format .
if you want to select the file format and the original files in the JPEG format , the original Ex@@ if@@ s are added to the pictures .
when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status types , in search of errors , see . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button Connect , you can sho@@ ve this window .
after starting the module advanced di@@ asch@@ au a window will be displayed with questions like your slideshow . you can choose between the images selected and all images of the album .
the option OpenGL over@@ approaches in the presentation will be activated very elegant image trans@@ itions by OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding Grap@@ hi@@ k@@ map , as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ ename option will show that the fil@@ ename of the images in the lower left corner will be shown during the presentation .
the option ty@@ ards ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end@@ los@@ ed loop . you can then manually Canc@@ el it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly choose that the images are shown in an acci@@ dental order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
under delay between the pictures can be set the tim@@ eless gap between the individual images . 1500 seconds of mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should let them start your friends with your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , the transition between images does not choose another effect .
during the slideshow you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to switch off .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , and stop the prec@@ eding and the next picture and stop the di@@ asch@@ au .
at the left side of the screen you can see the current file stream , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date right now has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org. Author : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module back@@ picture is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module contains the currently selected image , depending on the select option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE labels .
once you have made your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo sites , see the picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in individuals , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information that view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current sub@@ pictures . in the following , each one described for themselves .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changed . see picture below .
when you select a further person only the images are displayed , where both individuals are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can display with preview images to view the images of your application area .
in the picture every person has the same symbol before their name . they can store up with &amp; k@@ photographer , but of course for each person to store their own image , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you define themselves . see also the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button which you want to use on the tool@@ bar . in the seem@@ ing context menu , you can select which view you can have for the current category . please note that you can display e.g. symbols with images from people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no appropriate images ) .
however , you must define ourselves which image should be displayed for each individual person . to view this , you have to select the image editor , as shown in the picture . here you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the picture factor to your li@@ king and thereby choose which part of the picture is to be displayed or cut off .
if you open the entry window in the main window , a dialogue will be shown that is very similar to dialogue for fix@@ ing the image properties .
if you enter a sequence in the fields of appropri@@ ation or description , the complaint or descriptions of the images are sear@@ ched according to this text . if you want , you can also be able to insert a date after which , for example 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , however not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .
this is the U@@ hand@@ book for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but prefer to try different functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; and have a look at the fre@@ eway , the screen photos and the intro@@ duc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photographs , and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help menu of the photo album ; start the demo . finally , some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photograph@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar watch here : . as the name suggests , this bar will show you dat@@ ashe@@ ets statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different sched@@ ules . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing cuts only 10 @-@ minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline allows you to use the following ways inter@@ actively : you can view the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date displayed in the preview is displayed ) and also the tim@@ eline indicates the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline , drag the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline so that you choose to select an area , you are shown in the view view only pictures of this period . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images . one is available in &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; the next part of the user &apos;s manual is published in &amp; k@@ photograph@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create via the HTML file ...
before HTML pages created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more exactly .
first enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . click on k@@ fot@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created to see the overview page . nails information on export data can be found in .
finally , you can select which information will be displayed on the HTML pages . therefore , you can avoid that information is displayed at the viewer &apos;s viewer . for example , all pictures of a party are displayed . note that &amp; k@@ photograph@@ album , currently all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images prior to certain considerations .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , why not specifically noted .
bottom of the page you can view different solutions for the pictures . therefore those you have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images can download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time . so , you can change your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , as if he wants to display a picture larger it switches to higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website will be stored .
the best choice for all your HTML files will be selected for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and the next time automatically adds . you can either select a folder or a KDE Support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check whether this really will be visible for viewers . if you have created for the basic folder a URL will start a web browser after the pages have been created , then this folder should be . otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you do not have to copy them manually . so that the import function , see , correctly , you will need to specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base @-@ folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the exactly described settings are covered all three on basic sub @-@ folders and UR@@ Ls found . in these , a sub@@ folder will set the name of which you can specify in output folders .
if you are looking for a family @-@ party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; you may , of course , you may have spent a lot of time for viewing the images . if you have a lot of time for it , you may have to write songs , people on images , recording , etc . then do not need to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file , whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether the images can be saved into the file and that you can share all pictures of the file . the obvious draw@@ back is however the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the images in doubt . first , the images found in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . the corresponding pictures are not found , so the images of the URL you have indicated when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file by using HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog to export pictures , you can export over the menu file ... call .
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , the following three options are available :
with the option Manu@@ ell inside the .@@ k@@ im file , you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Autom@@ atisch to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures are automatically copied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip @-@ files . as most images are already very small with JPEG comp@@ ressed and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you like this , you just choose the option of export file comp@@ ressed .
the last option of this site is arbitr@@ ary size size . if you want to send your friends pictures , the images might not be in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can restrict the size , for example , that each image should be a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu of Im@@ por@@ ters ... select , will import and import database as described in .
the assistant to Im@@ porting is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which pictures you want to import , according to which folder the import should be copied .
it may be that you are the category people who are going to import file person@@ er ( if you &apos;re a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is called for your database people , which are to be imported into the third dialog windows and which categories are imported into your database .
the fourth step allows you to import the categories of the import@@ ing file with the categories of your current database . an example for this can be seen on the image .
it has to be easy to browse and look at : if you look at images , one often would like to view images of your Italy vacations and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all images on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual you will examine the different steps away ( 1 ) determination of the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and pre@@ stige , up to ( 3 ) advanced issues and adaptation options .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program for the Man@@ age of your pictures . but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml to the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup using a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , cop@@ ing on a flo@@ pp@@ y or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and uses these for future starts . if you want to find another database tree with images , you can launch a different folder database ; with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photographer album -@@ c ~ / company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings ; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photographer . in the following section of the user manual , the different settings are explained .
links you can see six different symbols that you can call for setting options for viewing and options for viewing the viewers . for each setting a detailed help is available which you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
in was described you as you can set for each picture different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , that is used to detect already existing groups . for each available group you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories are already mentioned in the dialog options . in dialog options you can set complete membership groups , i.e. , for example , all the members of a group set up in a group instead of explained all groups of a co@@ gli@@ e as in .
when you see the settings that are available to the solid of the member groups . with the above listed list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , there is a list of the current category and in the right one list of categor@@ ia categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album , shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as di@@ gi@@ val and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . approxim@@ ate information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called on the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules possess a help page which you can call on the modules themselves .
since the modules are used by several applications with each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo data base can always be testing out using the demo database , before you retri@@ eve them via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu help . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , thereby providing it may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photographer works ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also includes K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported by their images in albums : this type of order does not support , sim@@ ulated it for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photographer .
doing the current album , the current album , that simply matches the current view , so all images that shows you the picture show at the moment .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ ang@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will be the category you used in the intro@@ duc@@ tory dialog as a category for virtual albums , for example , if you want to use the category people , will then do so , so if you choose to view persons and pass this on to the module .
because some modules with &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog , and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded .
in the picture you can see an example of a first screen , as soon as you start &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are familiar with from every other KDE app , you &apos;ll see the window with which you can browse your image database . at the moment , there is not a lot of information , since you do not yet have a lot of information about your pictures . in the section , we will look at this window but then click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; is the ability to see each image with notes , where the image is recorded , you can put on each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for search and brow@@ sing , as you can read in paragraph , if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view you can see three lists with a text box by setting up persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your images .
the following idea is the moving image of images within the list : if you have an family @-@ party , and on all 50 images are shown the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can so that the names used to move upstairs are to locate the persons more quickly and classi@@ fy them .
if you prefer to display an alphab@@ e@@ tical list , click on the symbol for s@@ orting the date below the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and put these pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the buttons , which are listed under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can more convenient all of these pictures to mark and select the menu item add additional items to once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a trans@@ group . to show you that it is a trans@@ group , a special symbol is shown .
in the context menu of the cl@@ ue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new translation or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also select an entry in a category and specify , in order to sort them one sub@@ category of this entry . attention , that is pre@@ supp@@ oses that you just think your categories can be alphab@@ e@@ tically . see for it .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the strange dial@@ ogs , by setting the bar that form the upper edge of the frame , click and moving . you can also make your own window by setting it outside of the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button below ... which gives you the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also complete a frame fully . if you want to see this window later on , use the button below ... and then window a / off . this process will see you in the picture .

when you drop a picture in the background of your desktop , this image is set as a wall@@ paper for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it is displayed in the photo viewer . if you still don &apos;t have a window with a photo concerned , a new display pad will be created .
you can also delete images from the image below . simply select the appropriate images you wish to delete , or select either the Del@@ ete button or select the menu option . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album , which offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use the images stored anywhere without you having stored on the hard disk . of course , you have to record the images anywhere so you are in the database index . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . this is e.g. at the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the preview images exist , so do not view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image .
as you see , this function requires that you want to copy files from the folders and then copy them again . if you do not want to avoid the editing of your images , then please buy a larger disk in order to store all images on it .
in the menu images you can find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy please filter the images so that you can see for others in@@ accessible and click on Cur@@ rent marine privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that may see your little sister , cont@@ ex@@ ers and the menu item everything except for current view .

it is also possible to set a password which must be entered into un@@ lock images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for example , all images on the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can access , read or delete the password as un@@ encryp@@ ted text . this type of password protection serves only to those who are working with &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; they are not very familiar with the view of private pictures .
the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours , of course you &apos;ll want to look at some point . for this reason has a picture _ and video concerned . you can preview this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it naturally shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter about the image , such as who is on the image , when and where it was made , etc .
if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can simply drag this with your mouse and be elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click menu on the viewer . then you can see the right @-@ click menu below .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click on , the browser , see , matching entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected individuals from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and go back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slide show . a new image can be checked after a few seconds . how often it &apos;s a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or minus . then , and stopped the di@@ asch@@ au by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful capability of the viewer &apos;s viewer can change in the full screen mode . in this mode the viewer will use the complete place on the screen . just use the entry button to switch to the full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can put into the image and sli@@ des@@ ks . to catch the f@@ ake , you can come down with the mouse simply a rectang@@ le . with the minus key you can put down r@@ er@@ zo@@ oming The plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rectang@@ le marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image is not displayed zo@@ omed . with the equation key puts the Zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work in videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the plus and minus .
with the fil@@ ming from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this will not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you view images it may happen that you &apos;ll find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can see the ab@@ orting and configuration dialog of the picture to give this name , but you might just prefer to highlight the picture and look at some more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer in order to get the images on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above there is the viewer the opportunity to accommodate images with features , while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters . in view you see an image where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set the features on your images , these are available in the browser . you can then select all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use one module to copy the pictures selected on a CD or whatever you want to do .

the painted is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can turn your painted later on .
in addition , you can see an image in the painted area . to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ ang@@ album ; choose the image from the context menu . to end the M@@ alen , you simply put the cross at the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
in order to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but the documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you not read and understand .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then its properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire mod@@ elling section .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects already are selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar , or select the menu item in the menu item .
is there several potential positions the following folding menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
use the menu either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove previously selected items from the scene .

if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the publishing view .
press preview in the company &apos;s own view and a small example of the scene is illustrated with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture would have chosen , even if you want just a part of texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross locally .
the screens@@ hot displays the points of the camera . you can pull these control points with the mouse button and therefore change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and it is displayed a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marked the center for sc@@ aling and rotation . you can change the shifting of pul@@ ling with the mouse inside the whole window .
each object has an output model . you can specify this value relatively to the visual material of the higher level or as absolute value . objects will only appear if they are selected or their visu@@ alization stage smaller or the same in the tool@@ bar of the scene of the scene is displayed .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window marketing as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the default tra@@ its , or if you need a different arrangement , you can also adjust it to any other configuration . you can also save several platforms and simply switch between different regulations .

if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this program was written correctly . as this manual was written , it was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering the icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu pattern see scene .
an R@@ ender @-@ mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it controls the image size and the quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick Pre@@ view to full @-@ quality classification .
if you click on the tool@@ bar icon at the tool@@ bar , or select the R@@ ender Mod@@ i menu , the following dialogue will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , however , sense is a name that can detect the properties of the mode .
in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the det@@ ain@@ able image . if you only want to ren@@ dering the width and height of the image , select the cross @-@ box sub@@ section and enter the picture section to renov@@ ations into the input fields .
in the comb@@ ative field quality you can choose the properties , the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering you use . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diff@@ user ref@@ lex@@ ion lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual at &amp; Pov@@ ray .
if an image is illustrated with only one beam per pixels , these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ s pattern or fa@@ wn effects in cur@@ ves and lines , sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixels . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures can look better with this property .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , applies and links &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sam@@ pling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sam@@ pling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adapted ... the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive , recur@@ sive because each pixel is still further divided into , and adap@@ tive because the record high@@ s depends on the calculated colour values .
when you choose the first method of setting up POV @-@ Ray 1 Stra@@ hl , then both pixels by tracking a certain additional number of pixel with super @-@ sam@@ pling will be processed . if you adjust the repository value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a repository value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels . if the difference between the paint used the pre @-@ deser@@ ted thres@@ hold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which will be individually pursued and checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the record can be prepared with the repository .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of smok@@ es for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch J@@ it@@ tering orders , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; which diff@@ uses diff@@ use of light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map board , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent , if the associated beams did not have an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it is not expected , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu @-@ order file import ... and select a file in the dialogue window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is not yet the complete command of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . when ass@@ ass@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window indicates a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support code text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , write this source code between the two special comments / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * P@@ MR@@ aw@@ End .
you can move objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to import objects in the scene , just highlight the code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with cop@@ ying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called , if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is ren@@ dering a scene . usually , this Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
if you click on the assistance in the dead view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . place here the path to your documents and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; -@@ libraries . if you include files not in the folder of the scene , you also have to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in several paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the color of the rectang@@ le for the view@@ box in the camera view and in the window @-@ type labels .
you can adjust the object set of points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model . you can adjust here the switch separately for shi@@ fts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values provide an accurate wi@@ red model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects like the be@@ ers you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions .
if you cross the High Detailed view for enhanced proj@@ ections , all the wi@@ res model are further divided , when the camera used an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property includes a better approach for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering .
when you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is built . the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you examine the ground , a floor is located below the objects . the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you activate the caf@@ eteria , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ ased method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . the values for depth and sw@@ elling value can be set . more precise information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i section .
on this page you can change existing le@@ aps or create new window channels . in the section logo , you will explain how to create and store le@@ art@@ ments .
the Com@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ic Standard system Reg@@ ulations : displays all existing buttons . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected termin@@ ations at the start of the program .
the presence outlined below lists all existing pane channels . a new arrangement can be created with the button Add and selected a selected order with the button del@@ e@@ tion .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below shows all the views of the selected window order . new views can be created with the button Add and selected views with the button del@@ e@@ tion .
the position of the new window . with a new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with lock@@ ers , you receive a map view along the present window , with map view , and sw@@ ells the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have straight &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you want to start with no more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate but easy scene , at initial very popular : a bul@@ let at one level .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings , before you complain that you as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should remember these important rules :
if you do not set the camera , no rules can be applied to ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert a light of light , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black image .
if you have all error @-@ free installed , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; following pres@@ et window buttons :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols from the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and icons right now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu rec@@ ap pun@@ ctu@@ ally and then you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ red model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene that you create . in particular , you notice it in the fourth wi@@ re@@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ derer .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , see the contents of the view object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; find out more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but note that the camera in view has control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a Kon@@ T@@ roll@@ Punkt and drag it to the desired place .
when you apply the button or press the input paste , the wire model views and the object tree immediately changes according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a cre@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an comprehensi@@ bility method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; offers actually an easy way . you can use an un@@ end@@ able level as the floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree the new name will appear immediately .
the wi@@ red model view now indicates the layer now , although at the moment only as limited end@@ point level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree accurately , you will notice that you click on the icon + before the object . in this case , you &apos;ll see the different parameters for each new object : scale , rotation , and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should post@@ p@@ one the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just so you get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as below :
select only the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple in the moment .
in both cases , a dialog , in which you can select how the object is inserted . please select the name in the property tree . you can change the name in the property &apos;s view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks right now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment shows only one Matt@@ es of black material because you can still have settings for the pig@@ ment . do not always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , there are many possibilities , but you now take the easiest .
if you do not view any color on the header and ball , then click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now right now . if you are ren@@ dering your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results :
of course , this is not the color . you are required . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you have to list two new attributes , called One @-@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
select the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you already be able to run as you should understand the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . it can easily be understood just as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . Set the value for radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input paste or the button ) so that the ball has float outside the ground as you have shi@@ fted the bul@@ let around a unit down .
of course , the ren@@ dering gives now an aw@@ ful result : as previously to see , the surface looks like a Matt@@ es black material . put in the following step an appropriate material .
if you have selected the bul@@ let , you can now as@@ sign up a material now . as already at the floor , let the ball be a pig@@ ment as a color :
select Er@@ stes sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select Sett@@ ings and set the values as below :
but you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following photos and click on it , or press the input paste .
the settings shine @-@ effect and ref@@ lex@@ ion already result in partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : still not selected at all :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you render a scene ray@@ trac@@ er , the ren@@ derer shall be derived from the perspective of the observer ( i.e. from the camera that outlines the visu@@ als ) by each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam are calculated by the objects and how atmosph@@ eric effects like for instance fo@@ g . so , the scene pixel for pixels .
as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye on which you look at the scene . without a light source you see also nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that is to be explored , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted in this sub@@ menu and will replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space .
displays the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the latest storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only select only if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeated the most recently made command . this menu item you can only select if you have used back@@ ups .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog , enter a name for a new arrangement , entering an existing order .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and standard behaviour .
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cut . you can merge with this option pres@@ et short for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler and commands .
a B@@ ump map is a way to smok@@ y smoking , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually mod@@ elling and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary that use the same file both for a B@@ ump map as well as for texture .
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes you can use as construction blocks : very complex 3D models are made of do@@ zens or even hundreds of these basic body . these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels @-@ based base , by applying a image file as a color card .
for example ; it is a Com@@ fortable editor and browsers . the application has a browser in which you can select images to display .
you can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the picture or in the full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the browser will list files that you can show with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the key return .
you can indicate whether any image should be displayed in an own window , or whether all images are to be used in the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply tap the first characters of the file in the browser window . then a small input field was found in the lower right corner . if a suitable fil@@ ename was found , the file is highlighted . you can leave the text@@ field by pres@@ sures of return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Set up - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five map cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set in the two others , short commands , and short @-@ commands for the browser , can set the short@@ cuts for the respective windows .
this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest is filled with the background color with the background color , which you can further down . pres@@ et is not a full screen mode .
if this point activated , downloads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still have the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option store &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when ending the name of the most recently opened folders . at the next start opens a drive round ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored beams to choose a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode , the window is larger than the picture , is also filled in the background with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; establish that only some of the file types can be displayed , which the program can be present .
with this option for large images the display pad is increased to the full screen . this option is swit@@ ched as default .
determine whether the slideshow with the first image is to start in the folder or with the selected picture .
the time period between the image changes in one slideshow . to change the value , you can input a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders and the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repet@@ itions is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can insert a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change here the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operating modes : in the map @-@ maps , short @-@ load and short @-@ commands for the browser .
with this option you can switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short @-@ order presentation .
shows small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only available in the short @-@ order presentation .
shows preview for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short @-@ order presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
the image is enlarged by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the sco@@ re@@ ster for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed , if no browser window is opened more open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of fil@@ ing you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
Be@@ k@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Photo@@ chemistry based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ val ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the project source ; project .
Wi@@ fi foto ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and carry correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; this is a source foto ; an open source project . this means that the user shares his part in it , at least problems and potential improvements .
&amp; adventure photo , making it as easy as possible errors or possible improvements to report . where you are also in the program , the menu opens up a page to report problems and wishes . all required information is already filled up , and you can simply follow the guide to post your message .
&amp; adventure foto ; is a project supported by a community . therefore , users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; R @-@ foto ; then we would like to answer any questions about other users of &amp; R @-@ foto . however , in this mailing list , English speaking , you should therefore be powerful , so that language should be powerful .
the best start to join yourself to a show@@ photo , it is the developer of mailing list join . guide to join the developer Mail@@ ing@@ list of &amp; Confectionery foto ; .
&amp; adventure photo ; try to give you so much control over his working procedures as possible . there are many options to change the behaviour of marketing you . to adjust to these settings , you must split in the Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings menu . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
in the field of ex@@ pose @-@ indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicators were selected . dex@@ ter@@ wise , the colors should be displayed with what you should display in contrast . under@@ exposed should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &quot; show@@ photo &quot; features a side bar at the right edge , giving you important information and actions available to the selected images . you can also display the same page in picture editing . you can display them in which you click on one of the five tab :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is an application to scan images that does not make more than images to scan and sk@@ ew@@ s .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; is a simple application to scan images that does not make more than images to scan and f@@ p . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; for each image can be a dialog to store and store the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of support of your sc@@ ann@@ ers on the SAN@@ E projection page by using the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a default scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ lite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner was not opened or otherwise , a dialog to choose the Sc@@ ann@@ ers will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and click to open the scanner . ab@@ ort will stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ;
the other settings contain more det@@ ected options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options particularly .
to create an image , the user can only launch a glimp@@ se and then start scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Pre@@ view button .
to select the image better the user can produce inside the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . he may also set the z@@ oom to adjust the complete Pre@@ view into the window .
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the Scan @-@ button .
if before saving a Pre@@ view is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a window display , as below is shown , then the image is stored and sle@@ y ? en leads to a break @-@ up and you get back into the main window .
through the button settings the equ@@ itable dialogue will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving a preview . in this case , the option In front of the store must display a Pre@@ view . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the kind as &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; pictures saves the dialog to store any picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; this automatically connects to a general folder in a previously defined folder , then you need to save the stor@@ ing without a file name .
this setting defines where the images stored on the option store without a data stream . if the images are stored after each Scan , this folder is used as default for dialog to store . the default value is your hom@@ etown and you can change it to the button .
this parameter defines a educational fix for the automatically generated images and is in addition the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix the every@@ time is recorded when a picture is stored . # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to the stor@@ ing image quality . this value also changes the comp@@ ression value when choosing the image . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the kno@@ b aid starts the KDE @-@ Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; -@@ manual . the button below starts the KDE About -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite ; the button below shows the dialog for the settings and closing it can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ lite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs ke@@ yp@@ ad . below you can set a list of these short@@ cut and their function . the global short@@ cuts you can set out by right click on the player window and click the glob@@ als click with right mouse button , click on the player window and select short rest ... select .
you may set up any existing multimedia buttons so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; they will make your ke@@ yp@@ ad on the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ o@@ K has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six pieces and is descri@@ bing the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browser , players , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command@@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command@@ line options .
you should give the user a refund if the script should not be executed because of a missing item . please check in your script whether all required modules are available and use your dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; begin call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Res@@ cue Load@@ .@@ error Section = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE T@@ ings for Ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos;@@ exit
in the folder , scripts / maker you will find a lot of template @-@ scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply expand them to expand the required functions . you will quickly discover that writing is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can communicate with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p ; which every KDE installation should be included .
most scripts includes the exec@@ uting from external programs and commands . usually , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easily be called . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; send not@@ i@@ fications to all ongoing scripts . for this reason , scripts have continuously monitored their default file and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure indicates the script to display the setup dialog . to store the stor@@ ing and loading of furniture data . if a script should be run , Amar@@ ok , the working folder on the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ CO@@ P features more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the up@@ lift ) .
vol@@ um@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ ize Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le , contains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , when a user @-@ defined menu item can be identified . to remove an entry once you use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; it ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do such as Au@@ fr@@ aming . for example , the stor@@ ing of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s script can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .t@@ ary ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend a archive name such as example script . B. des@@ crip@@ pt@@ .@@ amar@@ oc@@ lips 2 , so that the user can see the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ K script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Ext@@ ensi@@ oning sacrifice . for this reason you should immediately set your script packages right .
the argument script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules would be not exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameters -@@ p to obtain the file &apos;s right :
if your script is ready , you can go to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and follow the link to the Wiki page of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ 0@@ p . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ K ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; has many useful and powerful functions and yet is surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list , instead of having endless menus to work . maybe you &apos;re looking for a quite certain title from thousand in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ie ; &apos; s collector &apos;s browser and the quick search , you &apos;ll find the play within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list is still hard for you , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Ap@@ ples iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many gener@@ ative USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and fancy - just the right to re@@ discover your music !
usually , one must enter the Fol@@ ding in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources in order to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ K .
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should not compile any trouble . if you encounter any problems , please tell them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; has like most applications some options , which one can enable or dis@@ able to dis@@ able the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dences must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you should full use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ o@@ K ; can be set without any effort on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Func@@ tional dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the dialog dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ o@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
player @-@ window display the player @-@ window in addition to the play@@ list , or if the option is swit@@ ched , only the play@@ list windows is indicated .
voting bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ les was compiled , the option swit@@ ched the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
un@@ anim@@ ous structure : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ d compiled , this feature is changed for the mood bar@@ ometer for the mood bar@@ ometer .
voting files in the musi@@ files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le@@ ci@@ d . if this setting is activated , .@@ B@@ files stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ d@@ dy / ) .
remote browser : lets you choose which browser is set up by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers : here you can indicate the path to another browser which does not appear in the list above .
play@@ list when finishing , store the current play@@ list automatically with the Finish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok ; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; activate this option when you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory of play@@ lists . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
up @-@ to @-@ date piece can be seen in the piece of change , that the play@@ list window appears to hold / off to keep the current piece swi@@ f@@ tly in the visible window area .
change depending on the context of the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section of appearance you can adjust to Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ . you can use scripts used for the following section : play@@ lists window , player windows and context @-@ browser . pressing on selection ... , so you can select a type font from the dialog dialog .
with the selection user @-@ defined shade scheme , you have the qu@@ al of choice and can specify a separate color scheme . use the including active color selection for front and background color .
play the start repe@@ ating that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start the play@@ back automatically with the play at the point where it was stopped over the last finish .
the @-@ screen display screen allows you to turn on the O@@ SD screen display . when On @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD display is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the cross @-@ field shadows causes that the text in the O@@ SD is sh@@ aded .
own colors will give you the possibility to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color selection opens the dialog to color choice . if proper colours do not use , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors will be used .
the input field display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD text . through the input of space holder may adjust the O@@ SD to your needs . below you will find a list of the available space and what they mean .
the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . in this way , you can specify on which screen a multi @-@ way monitor environment the O@@ SD card should appear .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate even more entries in this card map .
the map collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music @-@ files . to create a folder in the collection , select the cross@@ roads in addition to its name . this section also includes sign@@ boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
sub@@ folder re@@ kur@@ si@@ v search : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; both the crossed and its sub@@ folder after music is search .
changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is carried out in order to be able to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists to add to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the part @-@ sheet database is used to choose a database for the collection . the Com@@ pres@@ ser driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another installation is required in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql .
the section My@@ S@@ ql @-@ establishment is used for setting the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : the calcul@@ ator is typ@@ ed on which the My@@ S@@ ql databases are located . after that , under Port : the database port is entered , under which the database is accessible , the connection is established .
use us@@ ername : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the cart@@ ei@@ card last@@ .@@ f@@ m performs the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; can transmit the names of played st@@ ups to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and set up music recommendations on the actual piece of the piece .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
f@@ ake pieces send and so the profile update : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar questions : after activ@@ ating this setting becomes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to retri@@ eve the playing piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need any last@@ .@@ f@@ m &apos;s Profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio @-@ player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of features and gallery photos .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package K@@ del@@ er and otherwise no further KDE packages . you need to install K@@ del@@ er ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile K@@ del@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD , in advance that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ topia . Gn@@ ome is thus functioning , but flu@@ x@@ box will help , for example , We &apos;re trying to support Amar@@ o@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ del@@ bs and Q@@ t as they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the t@@ agli@@ b library . you can see the file exec@@ uting in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log . then please report this error to the t@@ agli@@ b developer under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also depend on the broken file that has caused the crash . then you can delete the file and make the collection again .
mostly , this is that t@@ agli@@ b s@@ cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a info from this file . please report this error to the t@@ agli@@ b developer under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K is slightly mature .
make sure that all libraries were compiled with the same compiler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; with GCC 3.4 , t@@ agli@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x has been compiled , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you are using KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then de@@ activate machines , if in@@ active for ... in setting up sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace per e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . when it comes to a common turn , the error is guaranteed to be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but this should not be noted as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The File $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ day ; print &quot; error during writing the tags from $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PAN -@@ e &apos;s install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamics ) . this is a well known error in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can simply click the control centre under appearance below symbols and semi @-@ transparent . keep in mind that in some cases it has to hit up to three times on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map but then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos;s _ BAR _ gre@@ p Q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ble q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf , that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some ways . most inst@@ aller problems clar@@ ified in the easiest by using an expert for your Uni@@ xes or Linux distribution . they can also use help with other users or with the developers . they use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only a mistake when something is located at the dent@@ ure of a bug in Amar@@ ok himself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; appears only a blank play@@ list . how do music pieces come into ?
this is easy . use the file browser to the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window is converted into the web@@ stats windows . you can find it under extra beds .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : STARS represent the rating through the user , while the points will be automatically calculated .
to assess pieces must be displayed in the play@@ list the evaluation column , click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; click on the Tit@@ le list of the play@@ list and select column . you can also use the short command@@ line Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ K is located in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select a play@@ list out of the pop@@ up @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and let them fall exactly like you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , next to the add @-@ button , you will be able to store the kno@@ b . click on it .
supp@@ os@@ edly , the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look at lib@@ visual , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is available in the context menu ( over the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it on the menus under the extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that is true really ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be the real media types supported G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support such pretty much more thought@@ ful audio format . G@@ Stream@@ er can even cause text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the default size does not be supplied ( from pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input paste
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the AL@@ SA S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows for several applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mix@@ er ) . please take a look at the aid @-@ position D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you find the problem of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you might need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ze ) .
doing this is &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media should be de@@ co@@ ded first . you can only see a white sound card . G@@ Stream@@ er is for most people the best choice when you read a decre@@ e with little over@@ head . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can spend directly to AL@@ SA as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of arts . open sound server sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable you to activate sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time limit ) and increase the size of sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ ap@@ per SU@@ ID is set :
in KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed play@@ back . read this mistake by reading this bug . the magnific@@ ation of the sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your AL@@ SA can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia complete around the quicker Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
pres@@ um@@ ably , use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for anal@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts et in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less requests react to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but if I want to switch to G@@ Stream@@ er driver , Wa@@ it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you must register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ o@@ 0@@ g before ! ) : - Download per@@ m@@ pe@@ g , compile and install it . then run in the module folder by G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please include them under bu@@ g@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org. For a whole list of suggestions / desires , send them best to our mail@@ ing@@ list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very well and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P it is already possible . place in your calendar program an alarm , and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves and Amar@@ o@@ K ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you &apos;ll aw@@ ake from the gentle tones of music that you stopped before going to bed .
how to get current in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; running the title if one is on another computer ?
if an working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . Dies@@ er@@ ect gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece of : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
re@@ placing IP address with your IP and I@@ hr@@ us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA is present .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window can be separated . press this d on the keyboard and the latest analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of Str@@ g + right mouse button makes a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ order sequence into the qu@@ eue a . by pressing the input c@@ aste after a search in the play@@ list , the first search results will be played and the search will be reset .
OK , the player &apos;s window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but what about the control in the system &apos;s system section ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; click the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is up to a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and on the console appear many bu@@ ries .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; does not work with NFS . either you need to perform ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ v MySQL support .
put the CD out , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to check out a file folder , select a few pieces and drag it to the desired destination folder in a cond@@ or window . for automatic code , you will take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

in essence , this is the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the play has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can enter the review for a piece of yourself by clicking on a column title in the play@@ list window . then select the evaluation of a piece just like all the other attributes , namely by clicking on the piece clicking and press F2 . you can also edit the rating as also in dialog Met@@ adata .
the developers do not want to tell you when you are supposed to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ K . this means that KDE packages have a set release plan that cannot come together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok , which some users can find quite well annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol to play animations in general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Sett@@ ings Sett@@ ings ... and take the desired changes .
download a design , or create a private . install it under Amar@@ o@@ ok ... Ex@@ plan@@ ing context @-@ browser design , click on new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Con@@ quer@@ ors navigation areas allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ oms , while you cross in the Kon@@ quer@@ or brow@@ sen . then launch Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation device . then click on the button below ( the top ) and select in the folding menu Add Amar@@ o@@ 0@@ ok ; .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is a free service which can be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free us@@ ername and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler is completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of stor@@ p and therefore also a lot of bug reports .
pres@@ um@@ ably has been compiled &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer installed . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ o@@ K ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules may still not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution which is installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the required development files . you now need to install the package called x@@ ine , you need x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install again .
I consider the error G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : Factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er has been compiled with Pre@@ fs , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you have to compile G@@ Stream@@ er without pre@@ load . one tip from Mer@@ lin @-@ TC : if you don &apos;t have any L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ o@@ K .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ stre@@ er , must be installed beside g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ it also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will find the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ pe@@ g .
you play a MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator G@@ ST register . then start Amar@@ ok new .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
among settings Amar@@ o@@ ok ... Audio @-@ edition enter the device . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine using a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ met@@ e@@ el 8x@@ 0 { type Plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm , h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type Plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm . h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
type in the furnishings of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB @-@ sound@@ card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scanning rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry but the audio edition with arts is not further taken care of . you are willing to take this problem even in your hand ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed controllers for arts : )
music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant who wish to update during the first start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ dies ; if you want to update your collection , then this fast start @-@ up guidance will be a help . with their help you will have set up a Amar@@ o@@ ok , in a few minutes .

the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is the most developed play@@ list of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there are in no other player . but don &apos;t let yourself be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window allows you to split into two main areas , on the left is the navigation device . in the navigation device , you will find some of the excellent features of the play@@ list , such as the context browser . on the right is the play@@ list itself . the play@@ list is easy to use and nevertheless for advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays important information relating to the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub @-@ windows are later explained later in detail . you provide information about the current piece of each different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; perhaps you may have noticed that the bottom window has fallen . in addition , the information presented here are now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; also the information in the statistics window will be collected ( extra statistics ) .
the sub @-@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .

on the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you can find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the song was played for the first and last time , and its rating .
to display cover images in the context of the browser , the file formats must be displayed in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats , .@@ j@@ pe@@ g , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images which were either downloaded from the cover administration or have been embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 @-@ tags .
the next section , Rec@@ ommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces on . if you click on one of these pieces , it will immediately be played out .

saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog stor@@ ing below is displayed with which you can choose a folder and fil@@ ename for the project file .
saves all completed projects . this is the same when you would call for any individual project file stor@@ ing .
includes the current project . if a project is changing and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between stor@@ ing and modifications . besides , you can then ab@@ ort the closing and keep the project so opened .
closing all the opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is asked for each of the stored project , what should happen to happen , just as if you were called for each project .
closing all the completed projects and ends &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for each stored project will be consul@@ ted , what should happen to happen , as if you had called a file .
if you open this entry , you can drag the embedded dialog files to add to the project . it has the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view into the project watch , the current project appear in the base folder in the base folder .
opens the dialog &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog based on the project . the only difference is the additional kno@@ b ; the name of the medium can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the dialog dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is it ? - Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data disk / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful when you put files from a previous session to import the current project . this is useful when you are fil@@ ming files for a multi @-@ professional session . it is useful when this function is not used for you so that you can see the files and folders using existing files .
this entry will only appear with an active data disk / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; to import files from the current project . all other files are recorded in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it only finishes the previously imported files .
opens the CD cop@@ ying dialog . this also allows without a project copy the cop@@ ying a CD into another medium . alternatively , you can also just create a picture of a CD which you can then burn sometime later . also , there is also the possibility of the cl@@ assy instead of normal cop@@ ying . you should prefer cl@@ one if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Cop@@ y dialog . this also allows without a project copy the cop@@ ying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also just create a picture of a DVD containing the help of cop@@ ying dialogue . besides , there is also the possibility of buying a DVD with the help of cop@@ ying dialogue , therefore the target medium must be big enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ um in the original form .

folding the scal@@ p in the project view , or out . the scal@@ p is a narrow area that is only visible when the project perspectives open open projects . the scal@@ p has no real function ; it looks pretty and separ@@ ating the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens up a dialogue window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after having selected one of the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ order to it below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . with this you can adjust the correct entit@@ lements to the burning of CDs and DVDs . therefore , System@@ administrator rights are needed , therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can proceed general program settings . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on applic@@ ants . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and for the tuning of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , as many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface is equipped with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality might be controlled by a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions to use , you can either use the command@@ line program , or the slightly more comfortable program called K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are exactly the functional and the type of your task is crucial to give you the help programs you pass .
in this chapter we assume that you can use the command@@ line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you need to make sure you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following an der console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programme in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts , which are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects available .
D@@ COP@@ US cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref . cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref . ( ) void copy@@ d@@ d ( ) int form@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void h@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( cur@@ l ur@@ l ) bool bur@@ n@@ D@@ vd@@ Image ( cur@@ l ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XXX@@ Project procedure one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ umb@@ ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) alternative to obtain a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch , using this reference , it is possible to change the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string pattern ) bool add@@ Ur@@ l ( curve : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ string File ) void set@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string host@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string path )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then insert files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der foo d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / onn@@ fil@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / foo / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Aus@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him you can easily saved audio CD ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on en@@ coder of the on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ olog@@ ator ; is the U@@ I surface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers who ( comp@@ ress ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( comp@@ ressed packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other co@@ dict@@ ators can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; released and stored in WAV files saved on the computer ( excluding and comp@@ ressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ ressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the fun@@ nel @-@ free FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ olog@@ ator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ging up to ( for O@@ GG ) or other body distri@@ butions are already available , so it is very likely not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions are already available , it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something itself . if for example the stove is not used , its installation is also not necessary .
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ player / File Format shall be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction of body , audio quality and comp@@ ression factors .
a word for cop@@ ying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ adi@@ ano@@ ia to cr@@ ack the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any cop@@ ying protection ; it is not possible to avoid any audio CD ; even if not the mechanisms of cop@@ ying protection . you simply avoid the purchase of cop@@ ying audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this results ( hopefully ) for understanding of the sl@@ ender approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ dict@@ ator programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )

this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step you find further information , as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .

opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of messages ( like proto@@ cols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for programming events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; stops ) .
opens the main @-@ presenting dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; with different credit cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ code ) . so , you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this section describes sound quality , co@@ worker and comp@@ ression rates , and helps you in choosing the right body .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ ure audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; hormones &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the low comp@@ ression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can be re @-@ typ@@ ed .
among the audio formats , the information through data comp@@ ression , depending on their p@@ sycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have the most common . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both body produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be provided with most distri@@ butions but there are open license issues
+ high to very high setting quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper recognition .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ qu@@ devices is available .
MP3 - If any music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special Auto @-@ stereo systems . today - initially only the MP3 format only supported the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting comp@@ ression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the tun@@ able transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo equipment with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , comp@@ ression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex tun@@ es and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo equipment with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , comp@@ ression rate approximately 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R joint Stereo , Kom@@ pres@@ sive rate approximately 11th 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ o@@ anlagen . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos;s = 320@@ K@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information collected manually or fet@@ ched by the program is automatically fet@@ ched from the free@@ DB about the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; co@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; and the co @-@ editor program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files .
in connection with enco@@ ding programmes , there is often a combination of program settings for the co@@ dict@@ ator and those parameters . the manual or the help of the co@@ di@@ ers explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) add if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches w@@ tt by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator must be added . the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { gender } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; col@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ pf@@ be@@ drawing in the assistant ) :
that &apos;s what is the free@@ DB is : a free database , to read up the audio CDs , the information go up instead of entering into the calcul@@ ator . it is noted that here only a text is spoken by : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes it should be legal , but I ( an@@ m. the U@@ eber@@ ries ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less valuable , so neither the artist can still be inf@@ lic@@ ted on the music company . all information can be attributed to a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ olog@@ ator ; actively choose an email address ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used by another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address used in the system . in this manner of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address while retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are many countries copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ olog@@ ator is set up ; for the use of free@@ DB will be required , the geographical position is to be used on the next @-@ lying mirror server . this saves band@@ width on the network and res@@ embles the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of reflection for the online recall of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly to only the actu@@ aliz@@ ations of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that it is going to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more precisely , look at source code ... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to keep in mind that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed at first if this has not yet happened .
for stor@@ ing the released WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ ver and therefore the desired file format will be chosen . for the first opening , there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( OG@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a comp@@ ressed comp@@ ression for audio data ) on the tab of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . other co@@ dict@@ ator can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package has to be installed by the relevant Linux distribution , before the body used can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined body dict@@ ator . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapters of the Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a codi@@ fication , further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ soles window ( eg ; console ; it must be replaced by the name of the installed co@@ oker .
this can have many causes . check the setting of the device design@@ ation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for OG@@ Gs , f@@ lac &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is false .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this may give tips how to proceed .
have you read the entire manual , everything understood but are somehow still uns@@ afe what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , and read our first &amp; CD ; we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ ers ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you still have them ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the form ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for every ending &amp; CD .
here we determine the de@@ duc@@ ting body quality ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with which free@@ DB will use to load the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it in any reading a &amp; CD ; if the matching settings are found .
the de@@ vic@@ tor drawing is handed over to the les@@ hip program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link on the actual device @-@ drawing of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be specified too , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the de@@ generation awards for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map list of General settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything will be as instruc@@ ted / as shown in the screens@@ hot .
only if you are asked for un@@ complete information , so that you will be informed when details are missing from keywords ( tags ) .
the card @-@ card CD ; simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; to connect to the Internet , so that it can access to the free@@ DB server .
the second choice is simple , is a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading of &amp; CD ; . that is associated with the database entry and the fil@@ ename / fil@@ ename or day entries , they can easily changed . the directories / fil@@ ename is changed with con@@ quer@@ ors &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
aside from this example , please note : if you want to manually re @-@ install the Cho@@ ices of the free@@ DB will not be used . however , you can use the database previously . for free@@ DB in the offline mode , these two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following map card .
CD@@ DB is free@@ DB for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data inquiry , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server about the Internet . how does the system , which data to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put it all as it is pic@@ tured in the screens@@ hot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
the CD@@ DB Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this road , the load between the hosts is distributed . however , this setting will work as a first attempt then .
both function equally attri@@ but@@ able to the server , since many Fire@@ wall is running the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol typically open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to send a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server should be disabled .
do you simply take the settings from the screens@@ hot . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
the number of simultaneously resulting pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know how easy it is .
CD ; after reading the last bit , please tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this folder , then / must be indicated the path / folder in which the WAV files is present . this can be useful if only space on another drive is present . if the box does not inter@@ connect the files in private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something using WAV files .
everything is as simple as it is in the screens@@ hot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances something must be fil@@ tered through right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , one setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo are sufficient . the resulting bit@@ rate is average approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved comp@@ ression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction of the tags on version 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos;@@ tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the procedure ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
move the rest as in the screens@@ hot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously to co@@ ding WAV files : with dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to run more than an .@@ WAV file at the same time .
this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you &apos;ve chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
in this section , described how the process of reading the &amp; CD is organized to the hard disk . we will build MP3 files , the way the music is arranged on the hard drive , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described . the process which is described in this section must be repeated for every ending &amp; CD .
as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the screens@@ avers is a little different than the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully managed by free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter instead of picking them out of the Internet . comments are indicated on the differences .
try not die &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must now be defined into the drive , which is defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in the screens@@ hot . this only when the &amp; CD ; can be identified as audio CD ; and can be identified by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you look in the section questions and answers according to the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD has been successfully fet@@ ched from the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out , and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key to your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion the best to your &amp; CD ;
if you don &apos;t have the cross@@ roads for automatic retri@@ eve of free@@ DB ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need the data from the internet , you need the connector on the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the tit@@ els of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen foto . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; updates title &apos; , the rest of the data in the text@@ field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist does not have to be given more in the input field &apos; updates title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply for all pieces of the CD .
note : after the successful recall of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors , so that you are not just starting with the artist and album names ( such as if all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary volume . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 @-@ tags , you have unlimited fuel @-@ length , at least on what is &amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; maximum . this option is set on the tab &apos; tab &apos; . please take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files later at any time with the Day editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags will not be assisted by all co @-@ workers or file formats . see the body &apos;s help to obtain more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously associated with the style of the PS@@ U CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not submit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap , for example , are under rock .
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album already packed with the entered dates , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply specify the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply specify the entries for the fields of the piece . in any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way to you all the titles of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB database . it is already sorted in one of these categories of database .
it &apos;s the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the item list .
note that there has a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked with . a simple click on the line turns out the selection of piece , or select the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
was launched by clicking on the selected selection of the selection process , then this window appears when confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow .
click the tab orders to switch off on the order window . it is in the upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for checking the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a body which you have not installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target folders are not what we have entered here . do you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is enco@@ ding of play 1 into the format MP3 . therefore take out reading and enco@@ ding parallel . please note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only one seems configur@@ able , is the number of parallel processes for reading and code . with powerful machines , the result is un@@ clear . the computer used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous er@@ asing and co@@ ding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the qu@@ eue of the co@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will finish a little window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ olog@@ ator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to produce comp@@ ressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the ex@@ dict@@ ator of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ oph@@ ator ; will keep you with CV@@ S ; CV@@ S do not have an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions are already included in an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions are already included in an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions are already included in your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it already ...
this section is directed to people who comp@@ iling from source files , and not for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step to get to know the options and settings . it shows photos of the different card maps of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first time @-@ up of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this kind of an empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts did not have an audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ?
what does it go ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look something like that :
a bad example : unfortunately no E @-@ Mail . the author doesn &apos;t keep this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual for a hand@@ audi@@ o@@ 0@@ ator ; it &apos;s intended as the first version to add or change it , may it do . at least until the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has off@@ ended this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal .
strange if it was done to you the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N to pick up , then you do not need this information but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er by &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others it has real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ ao@@ ke @-@ real@@ ms of texts also some characteristics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player not .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und proj@@ ector , which is required for CIS cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the text text on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting the ge@@ pres@@ ed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can go to &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window on the Mid @-@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( property events or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ Mid is automatically created the procedure used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; end the play@@ back of a song , K@@ Mid will start the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI synth@@ esizer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can choose the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will also be falling with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of piece , open it and pressing the button list in the tool@@ bar , select the entry entries from the menu piece or enter the le@@ aks .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in several types it will be added to a collection and then played in succ@@ ession . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a play takes place , you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and go out with the controller .
when you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and to the right of the template display and so change the play@@ back speed . to restore the original speed , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the en@@ c@@ aste has two tasks : if a play has been re@@ played , a pressure on the le@@ ert@@ aste , or selecting the menu entry into the menu pieces , thus breaks the play@@ back . pressing the le@@ aks while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back .
lyrics can be stored on two species in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tiles , others use li@@ fel@@ ine event and again other both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined to activate a song so you do not manually set the kar@@ ao@@ ke text entry . but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way .
in case you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of Tex@@ propri@@ ations or loung@@ ers . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you summar@@ ize . these are played in the series . in this section , you can use the collections effectively .
to create a collection , first open all the collectors . you will find this in the menu collection under the item .... click on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on cop@@ ying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will be included in the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust them in each collecting collector .
to the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to no other collection .
when using the application , this collection will not be saved . concerns you when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collector style . there , you can add a song with the button . it again appears in the dialog dialog , with whose help you can choose the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the adjustment of automatic transmission to the collection .
if an automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is inserted in the opening ( under the use of file opening or drag ) automatically to the active collection .
when Autom@@ atisch add to the collection is not enabled , the opening of a piece the temporary collection is activated and executed . this collection will then continue to be added .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open to the collectors &quot; collection , select the collection and the desired song and then click removal .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the set off from the sub @-@ menu , select the menu , the songs will be played in order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or select a random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
in order to play a song , select it in the collector style , or use the selection list over the kar@@ ao@@ ke text .
to jump a song , select the next one @-@ way song , the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right .
in order to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the entry @-@ previous piece by the menu pieces or press the key arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collectors &quot; collection , select the collection and click on the button Del@@ ete .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , however , this does not matter as they are not saved at the leaving of &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synth@@ esizer , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events in events which sees the synth@@ esizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always allows the trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all Sound@@ maps GM are compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS -@@ cards , FM @-@ devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . therefore , you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favourite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file , which saves all necessary settings for the play of a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear so often as desired . a pre@@ condition for this is , however , that each appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... END De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... END De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; ... END De@@ fine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... END Now ... END
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for options ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map @-@ file as e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; Support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section the pat@@ ches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard can be illustrated . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the le@@ ft@@ ist side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ pat@@ ches are in the correct sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to set all notes that will need this instrument to hit the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported by thread ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can give a drum ( e.g. with ton 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . this will carry the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is placed in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Drum Patch the Patch is meant to be a different per@@ ussi@@ onist in the patch ( Drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) , and does not the one in which the tone represents the sound @-@ height of the always same drum ( like him some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify the sounds on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as for the PAT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of the lines is very important , as their presence . you need to create 128 entries .
you can define a number of key@@ cards for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are used mainly to display notes on the per@@ ky channel . look for example the supplied ke@@ k@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . if you want to spend example the first and second channel , just do it in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have a percussion on a particular channel ( general MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi @-@ Geräte uses 16 channels , CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , number@@ ed from 0 to 15 , depending on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is pic@@ tured on the canal . if you use the keyboard option , the key@@ map will naturally be defined in the file name for this canal . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events are ignored , that try to change the patch on this canal . in this case , a patch is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to keep track @-@ on @-@ touch patch on the per@@ ky channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ ratio is to be multip@@ lied with the value Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events . so if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch file with the value n , this will be used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then first passed on . the value of 40@@ 96 is not used , so in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al@@ comm@@ as stand .
this setting is needed , because GM predomin@@ ates that a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender event , with the value of 40@@ 96 , a tone higher to play . unfortunately , try to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . these can be found in the menu below settings , item MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole range of keyboard ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on these keyboard , see what sounds just being played .
you can also use the view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , the kno@@ b is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original tool is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to indicate the played notes . you choose in the menu settings below the point of view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . if you find , e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . so you can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices with very different results , just like two different musicians could play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I cannot force anybody , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a comp@@ ression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synth@@ esizer , you can also change a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a bin@@ ary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; if that &apos;s happening , because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support , you have to download a source distribution and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s home )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not desire to add all files individually .
do not agree , support &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to choose all the files from and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
previously , the setting will necessarily create an automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can taste the arrow taste on the left of the template LCD , to slow down the play@@ back . to restore the tempo tempo you can double click the LCD double .
I have a &amp; connec@@ t@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop , I have to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file , only switch into the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to switch the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the adjustment of an automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to temporary collection add @-@ by files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you only want to play the first file . therefore , you only need the setting of an automatic addition to the collection and open E@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent to me MIDI files or Post@@ cards . all heart@@ felt thanks ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me the , further to &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time . as a hob@@ bies I have accum@@ ulate MIDI files , making music and propos@@ itions .
if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ ao@@ ke files if you have a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or to a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ ao@@ ke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; totally in my spare time and have been defeated by anyone for money . I therefore want to empha@@ size that I will only be more programm@@ atic because / if I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .

and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians from the net , which give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ ao@@ ke files .
in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also on his homepage , which is under ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .ht@@ ml . on the homepage you can trace the development , information search and pictures . you will also find links to sites with more kar@@ ao@@ ke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synth@@ esizer , since the sound quality depends essentially of your sound@@ card . it is not the same if you use a FM radio device or an A@@ we card .
if you don &apos;t have any sound@@ card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound@@ card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists or send a message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ pe@@ g . the program is used to play video files of M@@ Player or ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; on this computer it was installed .
for additional help please check the site The KDE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is formed from so called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optional , there is the window with the play@@ list . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to pick up the pre@@ valent links below the bookmark rates , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are re@@ played to each other , so you should use the category thum@@ b play@@ list .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional frequency archive . if you ex@@ ert an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and play the play@@ list with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and perman@@ ency play@@ list may also be changed by direct shar@@ eholder of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; k@@ m@@ player . you can easily choose the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player . by using the menu view . by the cli@@ cks of a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed this part .
after changing of XML files , the menu must be chosen from the menu with play@@ list and be chosen either in the processing mode , or chosen another category .
all changes are lost if the removal mode leave or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be swit@@ ched by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ends can be disabled by the ed@@ ite by ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and Change by &#91; General Terms &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files will be ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / .@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be an supported XML file .
the animation at the start does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , it would be annoying , however , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ work ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit ; / body@@ work ; In the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; are in the directory tests / some examples of sm@@ il die of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; supported .
there is a rider for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the s@@ lar@@ der size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the edition of m@@ player can be seen .
there is no rider for this play@@ grounds in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be con@@ figured with manual processing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ m@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa .
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within and k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
there@@ with the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be found , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the MI@@ ME @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setting of dialog file will be specified by KDE .
the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a con@@ soles application and search for error messages related to the loading of the browser module library . the stolen process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console output from the context menu ) .
whenever you have taken a checked back@@ end for a certain MI@@ ME type ( naturally only if this has been established also ) , this must be done by manual change the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , ph@@ one@@ on all og@@ g files can be recovered :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be downloaded from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be log@@ ged , the scanner is used from the configuration dialog , or configuration file can be edited manually .
for Con@@ figuration of the V@@ DR ( video data records ) settings in the k@@ est@@ player is the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ elle@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port to use . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected ( e.g. , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in .
since the V@@ DR supports support of k@@ m@@ player only X@@ video , X@@ video should also work ( pres@@ um@@ ably , this type of play@@ back of video equipment is the only that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux must be functional for the X server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time the emergence of this documentation are this d@@ vd@@ nav@@ source , d@@ vd@@ source , ex@@ h@@ lay@@ ered , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , vc@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ ink@@ . if they are activated , they start with the play@@ list of play@@ list .
are there some indication of how I can do my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely safe to put that / dev / c@@ drom drives on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts slowly but then each time my CPU has to be tested on its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ b@@ ash@@ k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the latest stored value , only the first time x@@ ine the CPU is checked .

with the automatic reproduction of the environments , using a new command ( e. g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the related line to the device file ( e.g. \ \ end { commandment } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the MEN@@ U settings .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; maximum the sub@@ division of the document in the following items ( part is the most appropriate and sub@@ sist@@ ence the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective sheet .
in creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; sc@@ aled file &#91; Engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File &#93; &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the respective line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contained a description of the form@@ att@@ ed document and also other information like the font , and is besides pdf the file output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to consider conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and sc@@ aff@@ s .
when using not@@ ables , the elements of DVI ; file with the editor will ch@@ ased , and once upon an element in the DVI , file search has been cli@@ cked . as soon as specified in a paragraph in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding location in the DVI ; -@@ viewer will be sung .
Master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a Master document the work will be simpli@@ fied with other .@@ tex files . in the use of a project a project @-@ wide Master @-@ document project will be set up .
quick @-@ installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ HTML @-@ text is compiled and the result automatically ( if there is no error in the code text ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI , file is enclosed in the fil@@ ter@@ - and there is no call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick @-@ construction .
in looking at the be@@ ating tool@@ bar , the three types of selection should be stri@@ ped out for the fast integration of common elements into the document . the first selection is for the rapid integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the ver@@ bal &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other means to the addition of articles such as tags , fu@@ eled notes or references . the possibilities are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
name : with this command a name for a section is created , an image or different element .
cover : to be used for reference to a fixed term ( selection or choice ) .
when using c@@ itation , a selection of liter@@ ary impressions are displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary Ed@@ it@@ oren required . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ Files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile .
the latest commentary box with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¶ nÃ ¼ e is used for defining the font . it can be set for the main text , the fu@@ eling notes , etc . it stand the following ty@@ res :
in the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two choices to susp@@ ending : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document styles and restric@@ ting the settings . 2 . the document may be written from scratch .
the br@@ ack@@ ets following the command \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class contain the setting for the command . the size &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font . the font is not fixed at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been introduced , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code has to be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way of this is the use of the gear or kno@@ ck @-@ p@@ aving .
the HTML @-@ text must be saved in front of the compile . &amp; k@@ ile ; get the storage automatically .
locks the comp@@ iling of the document error , should be sear@@ ched in the log of for the faul@@ ts . if used by quick@@ ening should be started . if this is not the case , it should also be considered the log@@ ging .
an environment ( en@@ gl. environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font , is supposed to have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ end { environment } .
the functions will only be cap@@ tiv@@ ated in the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } to \ \ end { environment } .
there are many possibilities to improve the read@@ ability of read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , there are certain fon@@ ts , li@@ printing , short printing , sub@@ missions , etc . it commands either with the command \ \ end or automatic at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { u@@ h } : this command is for the curve pressure and is long as long as he is enclosed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quot@@ ation in the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
having shown the background for writing the source language with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ option language , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile .
once in the assistant a little text was typ@@ ed , a few adjustments need to be accomplished for the better read@@ ability of the document . below , you should see a quot@@ ation , a few places in the li@@ pid and c@@ im@@ print and a poem to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed via editor or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . if an external viewer , the window needs to be closed .
once the DVI , file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and fun .
DVI ; is a large @-@ independent file format ( engl . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of your computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output , such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / pdf -@@ trans@@ wand@@ ler or computer scre@@ ens .
for printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as required for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - by clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar expresses the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI , file consists of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code was created , the conversion will begin to squee@@ zed other formats using the sounds in the tool@@ bar .
the pre@@ views em@@ bo@@ red the direct leap from the editor to each point within the DVI , file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ der . here must just be Modern under settings K@@ ile ... tools B@@ auen .
to compens@@ ate for pre@@ views , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of source , and le@@ ep up on the we@@ ep search tool . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer will then take place .
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI , document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document by &amp; k@@ ile ; ge@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ net and the corresponding row are sung . on this needs &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , are defined as a text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece f ...

should in the case of quick@@ ening of &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer not possible , a mistake can occur . should be a mistake in , it is displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the log file pul@@ ling the error source in source code . in the editor you can see the sounds of previous La@@ Te@@ X f@@ laws and N@@ Ã ¤ r@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X bug fixes the faul@@ ty row must be cli@@ cked on the errors in the log and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window to choose from the template is displayed for the document . the pres@@ et possibilities are :
selecting le@@ eres document can be written a document either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document . more information can be included in the section .
hands @-@ sensitive users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file loaded or a new file will be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; a new template is created by means of an existing document and a selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template used by file , some characters are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set in settings K@@ ile ... Sett@@ ings General .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which character chains are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is used by entering document types : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ M@@ ENT@@ CLASS@@ OPTI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the verb@@ s of commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been performed :
when creating a new document it can be balanced by default , instead of by default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . a simple way to create a template should be sear@@ ched for one in the Internet and the steps below are taken through the steps below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the enjoyment of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be carried out in the MEN@@ U tools directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more Ã ¼ ber &amp; Kate ; and his possibilities to experience , the manual for Kate should be applied . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start working directly with the editor &apos;s work with the editor of &amp; Kate ;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; a command reference , which can be called the MEN@@ U &apos;s using La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an exec@@ utable description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; usage as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with dr@@ Ã ¼ ck@@ ter str@@ g button to squee@@ ze the &amp; tex ; -@@ word meaning that in this way , clicking on \ \ by \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ .
when ch@@ asing the text with ge@@ ver@@ bal lin@@ ker button , the balanced text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
with the use of the arrow buttons with penet@@ rated Shift and can be washed out parts of the source language in the ed@@ it@@ or@@ window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to search for different kinds of source texts and differenti@@ ate them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands differ from normal text and also the mathem@@ atical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many assistant might be mer@@ ged in addition to one &apos;s own type of book@@ marks within the text . in this case , it is an own type of book@@ marks or the corresponding key@@ note test@@ ify to the next or last Spr@@ ung@@ mar@@ s . thereby , this spray stamp is highlighted , so that it is automatically generated when entering a character .
working is probably one of the main aspects when designing a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; important features for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special orders for their selection . under def@@ ici@@ des , the following commands have been given to the text @-@ selection :
W@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt a complete paragraph ( group of lines shown on both sides a blank lines ) . this extended meaning is associated with the tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of source language . the only explo@@ itative cause in &amp; k@@ ile ; is thus that the sÃ ¤ t@@ ze are separated by two blank lines .
W@@ Ã ¤ h@@ lt the word under current cur@@ sor@@ im@@ position . this choice also has an extended meaning as this command also &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return pu@@ ff ( \ \ ) and a sending star ( * ) at the end .
to the construct of a part of the document it can be removed and by pressing the key Ent@@ rance will be removed . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ word C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole row is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to the length of the text :
re@@ moves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to manipul@@ ate paragraph .
it has already been clar@@ i@@ fies that environments poses a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , it offers &amp; k@@ ile ; for additional commands under working environment , an easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ;
with this command becomes the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to the stream of the surroundings .
with this command is sung to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the cur@@ sed in the surroundings .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , the end of the environment is sung ( or vice versa ) .
in the entry of many screw@@ ed ambient command can quickly be lost in the in@@ fer@@ ous view . this command as@@ ures the most recently @-@ established surroundings , so that the wel@@ ded ambient structure is not destroyed .
&amp; k@@ ile , also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups that are determined by br@@ ack@@ ets { ... } are a few important commands that meet those of working environment .
with this command becomes the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the squ@@ ab@@ ed cl@@ amps .
with this command is sung to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the squ@@ ab@@ ed cl@@ amps .
if the cur@@ sor over or behind the soft cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is located , the other end of the group is sung ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many wel@@ ded groups of stap@@ les may quickly be depri@@ ved of the in@@ fer@@ ous view . this command as@@ cert@@ ains the most recently @-@ established group , so the entr@@ en@@ ched structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be supported .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple trials are used as a choice . for the purpose of being used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the character &quot; for two simple trials are used . also , for the end of the trial , the character is used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; he knows this case and bring two in@@ sol@@ ete character .
this automatic setup of double comp@@ art@@ ments can set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and they will be sign@@ posted .
there are also non @-@ specific settings ( e. g . no german or French ) and thus German or French character are also available .
in the pressing of shift ; input paste and k@@ ile ; an intelligent switch b@@ ump sum . if the current position in a lists of lists ( such as en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is for example , not only an envel@@ ope , but also the command \ \ item .
inside a tables -@@ environment close and k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an an@@ as@@ hing break @-@ off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments to under@@ pin settings . these can be added by settings k@@ ile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X are added to you .
some users want the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby assigned to all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) ; for the next row of Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; k@@ ile ; after the next row , it is not the per@@ verse , for the columns of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; Kate ; already , a good source code has been installed , these in &amp; k@@ ile ; in order to have special orders ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) further commands ( usually fÃ ¼ r &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . they are three according to demand and the other two are for the automatic encryption . all these modes can be set for different work@@ ings under settings K@@ ile ... comp@@ ass .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when transl@@ ating the sk@@ ate taste the last letter of the input will be removed and you would appreciate it as a result of the comp@@ ressed list . on the other hand , the list may also be decreased by entering another letter too .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , descriptions are collected by &amp; k@@ ile . alternatively , you might be fil@@ med by &amp; k@@ ile ; also spr@@ ing@@ marks , enabling a simple jump to these positions via satisfaction brands N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste Spr@@ ung@@ mar@@ ke really like and can be fil@@ tered .
under Sett@@ ings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; command@@ ing settings to these lists are made . it can be used various wh@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as w@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher des general lingu@@ istic .
the command mode is for complete the reproduction of settings not whol@@ ly . it always allows a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered . on the other hand , the environments will be used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for destro@@ ying the environments required .
when calling for full @-@ fast@@ ening de@@ war@@ ping the MAN + Shift key + Shift key , the command will automatically enter the command and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient temperature can be continued in the sim@@ pl@@ est way and by pressing the entry taste will be stopped .
after this accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; realize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item is rec@@ alled .
under Sett@@ ings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; command@@ ing settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ite de@@ war@@ ping mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; statements .
&amp; k@@ ile ; user @-@ defined lists of copies , which are immediately replaced by gl@@ Ã ¤ n@@ atives char@@ ms . the lists can be set up under settings K@@ ile . as an example of a depos@@ iting list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l is contained in the example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
if , for example , the letter L will be entered into and the word comp@@ ressed real@@ ms that sub@@ du@@ es the MEN@@ U + Alt Le@@ ert@@ aste , the letter of L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
Gro@@ Ã ¡ e W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter b@@ Ã ¼ r are not helpful for the automatic transm@@ issions . however , that many win@@ der in a document has been written more than once . thus offering &amp; k@@ ile ; the association for all already written W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter .
this mode can set in the MEN@@ U settings K@@ ile ... c@@ ile aler@@ Ã . here can also be determined the sw@@ elling for viewing the complete .

the dialog graphics designed the addition of graphics just as easy as possible . to classi@@ fy the bases of the graphics should be read , the sections and patterns should be respected .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer a superb basis for loads and re @-@ ordin@@ ances of pages . will the PDF file containing a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools re @-@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to observe the result of the work you must increase the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the MEN@@ U creating comp@@ iling , to convert and create patterns .
for the comp@@ iling of source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by the keyboard , or the other conversion . after that , the DVI , file must be converted to a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file to a PS file and be viewed via Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command quick@@ ening , a spect@@ ator is normally called after the compile . should not be used an imag@@ er@@ itu@@ dinal viewer , each time every new window becomes closed .

the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory ( nickname ) is the nickname of the user and serves to clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as team leader as well as sub@@ project leader .
the user can choose himself from the list of the team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and transl@@ ator the button . currently selected member ( their identification ) appears la@@ qu@@ ette after which you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and notes . see for further information on comments .
beside the overview of her team there is another advantage by collecting the team members : it can be done an event to get information to the team leader when something is done . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular in the project occurs . an example would be able to record the opening and end of the project , so that later it may be seen , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that performs a file to CV@@ S when it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the website &apos;s event @-@ configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project settings dialog , events can be compiled , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the addresses selected in the recipi@@ ents list . the address can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see , does such pieces be set up .
notes are special comments in documents . you differ from normal comments by following things :
input notes is simple . it can either be either the comment -@@ entry in the editor @-@ menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by a feature text .
notes can be sent a determin@@ ant member of the team . in this case the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) , role played in the project from the following possibilities : team manager sub@@ project leader in the en@@ coder and sub @-@ project lad@@ ders should be specified the corresponding ty@@ res or sub @-@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roles @-@ names are independent of large or small @-@ scale , but spaces for br@@ ack@@ ets and the note : make the note inv@@ ali@@ d .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ings , the D@@ TD @-@ testing diagnostic and scripts .
the settings are accessible via the settings menu . here , only via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be accessed via settings of Qu@@ anta . for discussion , diesel dialogue extends over several sides , which are covered in succ@@ ession .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / small @-@ scale of tags : large / small @-@ scale of tags . normal bulk / to@@ d@@ elling means , the tags will be inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
large / small @-@ scale of attri@@ bute : large / d@@ elling of automatically con@@ figured attributes , meaning the attri@@ bute will be inserted so as they are described in the day XML files .
op@@ tion@@ ale Tags automatically close : if hung , will be optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately following the &amp; gt ;
not optional tags close : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
starting and end @-@ day automatically update : if swit@@ ched , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic re@@ location of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding co@@ ding during inser@@ tion .
MI@@ ME types : Mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . with the button Standard , the standard values can be restored .
standard character enco@@ ding : the co@@ ding of new created or used in another way as with the file opening @-@ opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) , but this attitude here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD will be used for new created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not recognized . however , this attitude here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , made regularly backup copies or crash at the next start of the program . that is not the same as the store of the file . even for not stored documents is provided a backup regularly , according to the given time .
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editorial area or in its own view ( or the documentation in a cardboard ) , what it makes possible to look at the documentation , the Pre@@ view and the HTML code at the same time .
place the window changes to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface through changing the M@@ DI mod@@ i and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views have come through . it corresponds to the --@@ set @-@ layout command parameters .
the War@@ n@@ mel@@ ting Area also serves the taxes of the possibility to switch the display of war@@ nings by An@@ h@@ aken from No more inquiries .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL . it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts , as does the synchron@@ isation of V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . with regard to the different modes , see .
here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the representation of the Par@@ ser @-@ no@@ des in the document , can be submitted in details .
in the field of mouse click on the structural tree , it causes the following action to change by an@@ klicken des Stru@@ c@@ ams with the mouse @-@ urged action .
in the field of structural properties , the visibility of k@@ not in the tree can be opened and how deep in a change of structural tree will be automatically opened , empty fields are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , in which in the present document there is no element .
the section dedicated to fix@@ ing from ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ a break Ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something else than in a group is valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ part @-@ applications of third @-@ parts , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plugins must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard there as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be transferred to the plugin for the start , so it can open the current file , the signature folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode download : check if the plugin denied the shop . only @-@ read K@@ Parts is generally speaking to the store if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the typ@@ ed information is correct . then select the plug @-@ in is not available , but when the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the fault was entirely new . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in and PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of its , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin has been implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plugins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; adds .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options adjacent to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is active for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ U@@ I surface .
a view in which the contents of covered variables is displayed . appears normally in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with row , and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view where the output is shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in with to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ h@@ lets . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , that a de@@ bu@@ gger must not be respected .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session start the session . includes connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the run@@ way by requirements .
send a HTTP requirement to the server to request a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the View Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to start the execution of the script and to send information on the surveillance variables as well as the current evaluated line constantly . if this happens when the script is stopped , the script is continued even before a Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ claim has started , the script will start using the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , to begin with the execution of the script , without sending information to surveillance variables and the current tick number . if this happens , while a script is attached , the execution continues before a Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ request has been given , begins the execution as soon as a requirement is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script without inter@@ c@@ ting in the functions or concerns .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive on the script , although possible in functions and includes conc@@ ede .
shows the de@@ bu@@ gger that leads to the statement and to go to the next so , as if there were the current one .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or expression can be inserted , which is to be monitored . the gu@@ arded value appears in the depth view .
with this dialog , a variable is entered or a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work of Keit@@ h Is@@ dale , as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a k@@ part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which you can find on ht@@ tp : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keit@@ h .
this chapter outlines how you can adapt to your needs and adjust to your needs and how to help you and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; helping to get better .
docum@@ enting Ed@@ iti@@ er@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as car parks . their simplicity and flexibility are made from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . day files contain two files , the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . materials ( above Ed@@ iti@@ er &apos;s window ) , which add text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever have .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bar . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) defines both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and content of the property catalogue , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it contains a fast past@@ ing of tags in a document without danger of a typ@@ ing error .
day @-@ Fol@@ der are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the write @-@ language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.01 data )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es if they are necessary , or not . although not all is necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible to allow other users to have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a di@@ XML document . it can occur only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it may contain as only one element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for the meeting type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the type method does not comment . returns the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attri@@ but@@ tery and the attributes inside these tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
Set up a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ Day controls . this is an only element type element .
describes a attri@@ bute of a tags . this item can only happen once for each attri@@ bute . additionally it contains the name and type of the attri@@ bute . additionally it contains other tags , descri@@ bing how this attri@@ bute is to be indicated , etc . this is an only element @-@ type element .
gives the source used for the bot@@ t@@ ling source language for the attributes in the day @-@ Ed@@ it@@ or@@ dialog and in the attri@@ bute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ Metho@@ den@@ name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a stroke and a method names . the arguments , which are passed to the method . may be empty or % day , this means the name of the current tags .
a container date that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can happen for an attri@@ but@@ able description only once . it is a only element type element .
sets the position of the attri@@ but@@ ing of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for any attri@@ bute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and the size of a field in a dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this item is empty .
specify a list of elements that can occur within the specified tags . this item is an only element type .
indicates a list of elements to end a day . this item is an only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ De@@ declar@@ ation : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 enco@@ ding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be mounted and closed properly .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this to ref@@ rain will disappear , but some pieces of work would disappear .
for checking the Tag@@ XML files , the tools start dialogue up in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to pick Windows and over@@ check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this feature is currently not available yet . currently , check only in loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes it &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; -@@ element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file an &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; enco@@ ding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; function &quot; re@@ boot &quot; type = &quot; string _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional . / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor to be available via D@@ TD Bear@@ ic@@ ite D@@ TD settings . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 and conditional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .
action can be set up with settings actions ... click on New action leads to the same dialog :
this action was assigned short@@ cut . by clicking the user interface , a short@@ cut can be assigned to ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cuts is cut .
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and in exec@@ uting the action this text will be inserted in the document at the current by@@ te position . see the example below .
this is the migh@@ ti@@ est action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) ; themselves are the quick start @-@ in dialogue , or the different vik in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first of all , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter should be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable which can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file , file name is removed from the document name .
% pid : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , which runs only an instance , the text becomes unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control and quant@@ ap@@ lus , who is being used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the included methods can be a script input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to default . in the selection of input can be determin@@ ated , which is to send to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is generally recommended only with this setting .
according to input can also be re@@ directed the output of the released application . there are two types of issue : normal output , based on the default code ; it can be specified , what should be done with the text @-@ written text by adding the value to the optional output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar by each group , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the start @-@ ups .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add and configure action . select Sett@@ ings promotions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the new action kno@@ ck at the bottom of the window , starts operating mode .
fill in all the fields and add them to the right tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag will have attributes and you are planning to use their use , activate this dialog &quot; day , if available , making an entry when using the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; sem@@ icon@@ edit ; used by standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , you choose to work size .
please note that the created symbol is not only helps you to remember what the action does , but to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ;
regarding that the day start , called , I decided to create a start@@ kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly interpreted as possible , rigi@@ d , further interpreted ) , or should at least to sign@@ aled a message to the user that An@@ nam@@ ing this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start the day in the current document .
following the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens beyond the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the use button and continue with other tags , so it still gives , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should adjust them to better survey by some separ@@ ators into multiple groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar set the tool@@ bar selected by setting the tool@@ bar . ensure that the tool@@ bar selected is selected .
I want to select the denomin@@ ator ( on the left top ) for my tool@@ bar . according to the selection of the elementary propos@@ itions , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the denomin@@ ator aid the group@@ ing . anyone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button is .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by sam@@ pling of all symbols , to ensure that everything works .
secure in the correct folder . once new XML does not exist , it will be applied in the correct folder ( s ) , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder . please adjust its &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their tool@@ bar will be loaded ( n ) if a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ att@@ ing language you like . therefore , this chapter like I first describes a &amp; PHP ; Docum@@ entation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might be in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory , whether someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . in the first part , we let you go to the second one here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relatively to this file , to the docum@@ ent@@ ations ( e.g. php@@ 42 / # element = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Image 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html func@@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html -@@ 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html -@@ 3 = day@@ s.@@ html -@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example , you can see it in PHP &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .ht@@ ml - Language Reference = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax .ht@@ ml ...
notice the # before @-@ started and Language Reference . it indicates that this is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the ch@@ action ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
remember that the table directory is refer@@ enced directly on a file ( and un@@ wa@@ vering at the top of the construction supervision &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
space @-@ signs affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ ourc@@ end@@ at@@ eien .
the content @-@ section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array -@@ functions . by flag@@ ging of the function@@ alities and pres@@ sures of C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context aid , documentation would directly appear . there are only two types of entries here : the chec@@ ks@@ list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ binding .
a simple list of through @-@ separated context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the features of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c easily and share a folder after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quant@@ a / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as described in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been utilized to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; are you not alone . it is possible to divide the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can send by email to friends , partners or otherwise whom will be sent . in different places there is an With e @-@ mail menu including D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send to email , tool@@ bar by file and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archives , from where all others &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ users can download them and only available if our team needs them to be correct and useless for publication . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you will need to edit an item . in the dialog New resource needs to be desired ( URL preview may be empty ) and by clicking on OK the upload will be started .
the high @-@ load can upload from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ates and Scrip@@ ts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examined &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by exam@@ ining the integrity and signature . if the integrity given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it is possible to work time by setting up a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in tag could be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ TD automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from D@@ TD charging and conver@@ ging a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD &apos;s description that is to be used . then , the following dialog :
target @-@ name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written by this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quant@@ a / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ Book Defin@@ ing line : the string that is in ! Doc@@ uments day , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ ml@@ 4 / lo@@ os@@ e.@@ dt@@ d appear
the setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; according to the conversion to the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this opportunity to utilize .
in &amp; quantitative , there are some key concepts . to understand them and get full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore they have to bring along with these fundamental concepts . this chapter is trying to bring them to these concepts without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; some benefit from it .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , divided the working area into three fields : global , local and project . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , who is available . this enables the administrator of administr@@ ators to secure the tool@@ ing , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local items are a personal collection of web developers for a single user . they are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bar . local items are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related items are available only within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bar with special promotions specifically for the files of a certain project . simply stated , this is the most complete size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which means sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
das &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several key areas : the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window , the construction views , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bar . please refer to and for further information about these fields .
you can click the map with the right mouse button to obtain an account menu with the current document , such as close the current , other or all cardboard , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right menu in the editorial department lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / paste / paste ) , processing of the file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , or opening the file when the string under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor calls a file .
at the top of the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ad@@ der , the tool@@ bar is introduced . presently , &amp; HTML ; 4.01 Trans@@ itional is presented as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bar is demonstrated . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ athy ; the tool@@ bar is adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert in a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; then click on the icon which has shown the day . if they want to insert the data for this just attached day ( like an@@ chor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the buil@@ ders ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate to them and ro@@ am . in the presentation with cardboard boxes are available for files , project , model , document attributes , documentation , attributes , and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows the custom@@ ary files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions like Add , Del@@ ete , upload , or delete the files from the storage media with the displayed cont@@ ingent menu .
another opportunity to quant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more about templates is found in .
here you can find information about the available scripts in Global , Local and Project . by clicking on the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information about a script . on the right mouse button , more features are available , such as the script to boot , edit or send with your mail .
with this view , one points the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ clicking on the element of the element , the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . through the right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands with respect to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other Bau@@ man@@ views . with it , can change man@@ rapidly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . that focuses on the content of concrete admission system allows modification of all available attri@@ bute names with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for finding the web technique for your development . you can download pre@@ packed documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , one can create their own documentation , and by adding a folder to a project can be added to the project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two sm@@ er@@ led at the bottom of the window , using the beneficial information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this map shows information about each in Qu@@ anta ongoing script . that is , for example , the D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD currently displayed .
this map shows all faul@@ ts in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; - script that will be executed , give all error messages ( so it gives ) in this window .
die &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Werk@@ tool@@ ing are extensive and easy to understand . indicate a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the tool@@ bar of the tool@@ bar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define .
another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; when they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can only secure this in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , like any other and invite you !
it is reasonable , if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; files to your system . therefore , auto@@ conf file to get to the configure script . to give a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here not executed .
if you have trouble passing von &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before their bin &apos;s folder . same counts for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , is a web @-@ phase tool for the KDE interface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , was optimized for a quick web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , who would be that if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now , this would make him the absolutely greatest Web @-@ course tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , so far too far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ised , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it ought to quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore the appropriate &amp; IDE ;
now , to the above must be maintained that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developers , what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ old not only this is possible , but permits users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand how they need it for their need .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , allowing web@@ developers to increase the usage of a intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by means of having self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool@@ ars , without wor@@ rying out a scrip@@ ting language tax . ( more about it you find in . )
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for quick web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; quant@@ a ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers made the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details the documentation is help with help : / quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quantitative ) .
&amp; quant@@ a ; it is currently developed and followed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon cu@@ LC @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file that is not located , the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section about templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pres@@ ner folder , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts in inser@@ ting the cli@@ p@@ board there is special characters for &amp; HTML ; log@@ otyp@@ e , so that they are displayed correctly and not by the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; option which is the correct way to insert special characters and blan@@ ks in &amp; URL ; s is used primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s into the chor tag .
enables the block@@ ers to or out . that allows you to choose text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . that is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script g@@ fixes !
is searching for a string or regular expression in the chosen directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined press to help you .
displays the message window , or not . that is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and switching of the problem @-@ re@@ por@@ ters at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; captain . the problem center will be activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the tool@@ column left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if book@@ marks are contained in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the tag .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
sear@@ ched the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows , e.g. video files into your project folder or a sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project .
the files in your project invites the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Slave ) .
settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects can be found the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bar and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that only creates the name . actions must be stored using settings of actions ... stored by tool@@ bar to store the tool@@ bar that you want to store the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not del@@ etes it from the hard drive . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you want to do that .
this means that you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next publication ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bar to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or ir@@ ting anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
re@@ charge / re@@ fresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; . is useful when the entities to renew the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is and a writing permission in the global KDE folder is not present , the shop failed .
this menu includes a list of tags , which are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day &apos;s setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insert of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting a tool@@ bar if this day goes against the rules at this place .
in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed below the above @-@ mentioned menu item . an@@ klicken Sie . an@@ klicken
select the syn@@ tax @-@ mechanism for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ Version .
choose the type of Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ende identification . very useful when you know people , the other OS platforms to apply . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syn@@ tax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application of tidy .
immediate revers@@ al between the different types of the interface . due to some limitations in the KDE libraries , the circum@@ stance sometimes need some time or create uncomfortable graphics . recommended that the box Card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for every open sub@@ window . with selection of an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
split@@ s the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the main window .
the changes in this dialog include every application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
judge the behavior of the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ r . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears , where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar , which you can add or change the sequ@@ ences .
this should create a manual corresponding to the environment of the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always need help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development of financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed most from top to bottom , e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be automatically completed . all these paths and author e@@ fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project properties .
here is the name for the project to give , for example foo . when entering the name file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Project file . by default , she has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is saved in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , one , except you get your local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ un@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the standard settings of the selected lo@@ gs are used . depending on the adjustment of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default , if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be dis@@ continued instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by standard tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files are used for various projects , this folder should be dis@@ continued instead of the standard .
this allows files to include files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or whole folder can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . on ser@@ ver@@ side script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently .
stopping , if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be involved . if a project is emerging from scratch , not an@@ aken .
with this option all the files and folder will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a proper selection to the thin .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by typ@@ ho@@ oks , or , by removing hem@@ orrho@@ , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project @-@ properties in the lower profile , or change the short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ ename ( wild@@ card possible ) which are to be ignored in the project @-@ related operations like the project ord@@ ner .
supple@@ mental option on the top , also files that are listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project perspectives , which is loaded at the opening of the project . in this case more about project views can be read .
in this way the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be adjusted by the button Options . in this case the de@@ bu@@ g@@ fixes is described .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub@@ window profiles high @-@ load profiles can be set ( see in ) as well as the display of a tool @-@ view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out their own belly @-@ view for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , processed or deleted as well as a mailing list . see for details .
in the underground event , one can switch event action , change or delete these actions , change or delete them . events promotions are executed when a previous event occurs , such as sight@@ ings of a file . see in the details .
by default , opens &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project which was open . this behavior can not affect them at this time .
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog is open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same if you load a new project .
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
Fol@@ ders also behave , however , missing the entries are missing and open with ... in the right mouse @-@ click menu :
here , different profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the place of high @-@ saving files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more a profile is present , the button is canc@@ eled , to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in a core memory and has forgotten this possibility . this possibility is useful when most frequent up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ certain password saved on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
that will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ weight profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server , which should be copied to the files used . either a fully qualified dom@@ ain@@ name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is recorded on the record , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming , it can easily see in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. through simple di@@ agrams , different files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and re@@ placing the currently open files and tool@@ bar .
views can be stored or deleted from the project tool@@ bar , reachable or deleted from the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , who has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to his own working method .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bar in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best about the menu tool@@ bar . use and add different . add to the tool@@ bar is treated down in the section Add @-@ tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can be adjusted either using Kont@@ ext@@ menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , the tool@@ bar can be applied as tool@@ bar , which can be applied to the dialog , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible .
by calling the context menu for an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries must remove action and edited action edited , which are self @-@ explaining .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can be set in the menu using settings tool@@ bar .. and set settings actions .. adjusted .
templates are located in essential tool@@ chain , code cut@@ lets and files to create link@@ ages . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates such as a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organisation and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any at the system available directory in the pre @-@ storage area . templates have in approximately the limitations you provide for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided Templ@@ ates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions at the beginning of each template led conditions before using precisely .
Bin@@ der is all that is not purple text . it can be any file except text , so pictures , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ ary templates are usually added in documents using link@@ ups ( e.g. images with im@@ g src = / src / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the pre @-@ storage area under global templates . more information about templates tree is available in .
documents can be created by any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents can be created in corresponding sub@@ folders . one makes a simple form for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate way to efficiently . some examples may be found in pre @-@ storage space under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
this kind of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in documents . you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or Perl &apos;s base . some examples are found in the warehouse area under global templates . see for more information about the templates .
as the name says , serving these templates for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ised in a comp@@ ressed tar archive . currently there are no examples of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File as a template and save as a local template .
once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project position ) the submission is not visible in the project tree . look at the pre @-@ camp site under project requirements .
select text in your document and then click file as a template to save as local / project management . alternatively , the selection can be easily drag@@ ged with pul@@ ling and insert on the building content .
the creation of bin@@ ary Templ@@ ates is simple : the file can only copy into a pre@@ disposition . it can be used all file management functions , such as pul@@ ling and insert , or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder right or in the project files . selecting a folder on the right and secure site template , secured a name for the template and secure . by default , it is guaranteed as local or global template .
project requirements enable a very single @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ prints , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; in addition , you can keep some things in keeping with templates in projects very profound in mind .
the pre @-@ store structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / quantitative / divide . each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behaviour of a folder with right mouse button , click the folder and select in the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bot@@ tom@@ ed as soon as El@@ ter@@ liches attri@@ bute names .
this is enabled by default and does not fit for anything except the regular folders in@@ doors . if a tri@@ bal diff@@ user would be dis@@ able , it would appear explicitly in this path . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ asts would appear with something like text buil@@ ders . if nothing appears , you probably will be in a regular folder .
allows previous or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be more general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows head@@ lines to equi@@ pping a folder of special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines already using the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
in addition , we use the context menu ( show them , right mouse button , press ) through a complete command collection to add folders and paste from templates from one place to another .
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Quell@@ text @-@ Editor , die über das Menü View sind . der erste mode replaces the HTML @-@ Editor through the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the Z@@ weite split@@ ting the Ed@@ it@@ or@@ window into two parts : the HTML @-@ Editor and V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and turn on demand for the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will be visible in the source code .
working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor in a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit the code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit the source code . there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works precisely like the first , except that the changes are visible in the source code as well as in the V@@ PL , editor and the cur@@ sor in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will be active , this mode is already active , puts the key pressure on the active cur@@ sor from one window to another while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation interval between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable from settings Qu@@ anta . in selection can be set between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in addition , the timing can be set in addition to time span . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small margin for fast computers and a large margin for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so tools of the invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will also be called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will be created once a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor will be created . this is used to change the release of the suspension of co@@ di@@ eting .
Met@@ a @-@ tags will allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. key words for internet search@@ engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click on the list allows modification of the content , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new path to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . currently using CSS compliance is currently not supported .
it is possible to incorporate an external CSS @-@ style content by pressing on the file button , and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of cur@@ sor is as described in a text processing , with due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor works like usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing typ@@ ed and delete a taste or del@@ e@@ aste .
the inser@@ ting of tags will be made in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as described in the source code editor , it is noted , that inser@@ ting the tags will be inserted previously already existing identical tags , e.g. if an an@@ chor tag , surround by text , each other real@@ ging an@@ chor is removed .
some tool@@ bar like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will be later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release , tables or lists of tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of breast@@ feeding . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding the search for certain elements is possible and the implementation of the Stil@@ ts can be pursued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .
stop in a template , in a position in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g loaded style or x@@ ml file or at the current k@@ not . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db @-@ Com@@ pati@@ bility mode can be set up and be activated later in a specific file and file number .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is determined the complete path from a fil@@ ename without a path@@ name . fil@@ ename in the same folder as the top@@ most up@@ loaded path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example a st@@ aging file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl , is the following input possible :
this command is vali@@ dated to a partial or complete agreement with a number of my@@ QNA@@ ME or a specified mod@@ al name . &amp; eg ; template is with any QNAP line that contains the string template .
any nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; is added according to the rules created by the in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / transform@@ ations : test@@ 1
a challenged holder needs to be dis@@ solved for the per@@ tin@@ ent UR@@ I and line number . this will automatically be executed when loading the first template through x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re@@ ver@@ ified shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphic tools for compar@@ isons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do you let me explain why I wrote .
the meeting was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected it in many places . another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts at together .
the program used by me only showed me the altered lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines - and there was no indication of the places where maybe just the re @-@ shi@@ fts had changed . that changes , this change was a little night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; differences emerge within a line and changes to white signs . later , plenty of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the simultaneous windows .
a function which did a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully @-@ run file browser .
also 3 @-@ way together will be fully supported . this is useful when two people operate independently of each other in a piece of code . the original file ( the base ) helps to dis@@ solve the results . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screens@@ hot showing three Qu@@ ell files to merge with :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with compar@@ isons and bring together complete folder . this screens@@ hot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you can merge with the folder :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and di@@ ces against the possibilities of today &apos;s colors . if you often have to check the co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if only lines in a certain number of white signs are visible , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no hass@@ le more , if someone changes the re @-@ shi@@ fts . )
when a file is the same , and the other diff@@ ers in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red paint means that both differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the Ti@@ p@@ your work by using only the fil@@ ename of the first file completely . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folders 1@@ folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder , folder 2 folder , folder 2 folders 3 folders , folder
opening dialog opens the manual input from file names , the selection using the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a most recently opened file from the list . you do not need to specify the third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files is executed .
over the folder , you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the compar@@ isons is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders .
if assembled , the input field is actively involved and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file . you can also get this step later on the stor@@ ing .
the setup button opens up a dialog with settings . you can set options before you start with the comparison .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then allowing you to pull text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board in the active compar@@ ative window . the comparison begins then immediately . in the opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and drop you : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a window window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , this would be a relatively large effort . they &apos;d first need to create two corresponding files they &apos;re in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy the relevant sections easily , and then compare .
note : currently you can not pull out anything out of k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case type of text is supported in a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ ting and remove text into another program than cut and past@@ ing ( instead of cop@@ ying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the top of each text window is the info @-@ line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( when the path to a file is too long , the mouse will rest a while over the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . )
the three sources are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the colour blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can change over the settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees in the colour , which file diff@@ ers . if both files differ , the pres@@ ets color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( guide ) well .
links next to the text is the pool@@ ing column . if differences were found , the color indicates the corresponding color . with some programming languages , where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , white characters are only relevant in character and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line which separ@@ ates the summar@@ izing column of the text is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line @-@ file has been activated , the line is dot@@ ted by broken lines .
the result of the result ( under the compar@@ ative window ) also has a info line with the ins@@ cription output : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changed &#93; when you have the product already done . usually it contains by the automatic compiled text already , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , the stor@@ ing down@@ s is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Jump to next types / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows the present group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows . ) this group becomes the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current field and each other at the left is a black beam .
sometimes , through conversion , or by manual returns no further line will remain in the group ; then this is displayed in those lines of text ; then this is only a space for the case that you may change your mind , and perhaps another source . this text is neither written in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er you might copy and put elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; compound concept ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . proceed with this feature request .
note : when choosing the options the options ignore or ignore the options numbers or have not been activated / C + + commentary , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ates mainly by images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you use in one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons , right , bottom , end , str@@ g start and w@@ g end , si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . the over@@ lap column next to the vertical image load can be used by or also click the Navig@@ ate .
in the Aug@@ ab@@ ef@@ en@@ ster you can also use the other keys to work . with the inser@@ ting button you can switch between insert and trans@@ cription mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns syn@@ cs the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already assembled in the section and the ed@@ itable output for@@ ks has been explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last contrast , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g image up@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g picture ) or to the next / forward conflict ( Str@@ g image later ) or upon the manual , therefore , must be differenti@@ ated between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the mark@@ ings into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must press the cop@@ ying -@@ button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ ting ) . however , this option is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and install the manual cop@@ ying . be careful with this option but cau@@ ti@@ ously because you might mistak@@ enly sign the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
Z@@ eil@@ en@@ enden are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ variants use a Z@@ eil@@ en@@ pre @-@ conc@@ ub \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 reserve the line @-@ end of the source files not in , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and re@@ inst@@ ated in the next launch . ( menu entries ) &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 users ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides papers with vari@@ abl@@ er width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are represented in recur@@ sive font . if the chosen script does not support this representation does not happen at all .
in systems with only 16 or 256 colours , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be illustrated . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically displays an odd colour .
when this option is activated , the pres@@ sures of the Tab@@ ulator button is inserted in the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
if you press entry or return , the activation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
when this option is activated , every selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which type @-@ party type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
while compar@@ ing files tried &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are not ignored . in this step , white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on certain systems ) save a car mark &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again save only a string push @-@ side comparison , but then they could be different with different sizes in the page @-@ on @-@ side comparison , though they may vary . if this option is actu@@ ated , che@@ ques must be de@@ activated , however , as a white sign will be disabled . during the default , this option must be de@@ activated . in the default things it is disabled .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis there are numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the outcome , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are dealt with as changes in white signs .
intensi@@ vely after even bigger differences . the option is in the default setting . it is effective with complicated and big files , but slowly with very big files .
in the automatic transmission mode determines this setting how long the result of the selection will be shown before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
rele@@ asing all conflicts in white signs using the chosen file as a source . ( pres@@ et is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need it from time to time , then use the automatic selection in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore either ignor@@ ance C / C + + .
these options are dealt with in the section for scanning range of folders and arran@@ ging a merger . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and meeting .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , then the original version is app@@ y . if already such an oven with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .or@@ ig exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current ongoing program . you need to exit and rest@@ art , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set globally via the control centre . )
the following ex@@ position settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if one activ@@ ates this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
over the selection points for the co@@ ding appears a brief reference , which is the local co@@ ding . ( this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature . )
adjust the code enco@@ ding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpret . as the co@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different co@@ ding can be compared and combined .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding for stor@@ ing is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ editing process , you might not work with your co@@ dec ( for example , your files can be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only control with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can define the co@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing trans@@ forms .
turn this off to supp@@ resses the high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or review terms . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore either C / C + + . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . depending on the selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is adjacent to the normal nor a second over@@ lap column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . take the less important window . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
displays the compar@@ ative side next to each other or another . this can also be useful for viewing many long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then select immediately the files merge together . a simple click start the merge and used the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to start the file again , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file it will be transferred to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own proc@@ essor , which corresponds exactly your requirements . for example , you can use this function for example to cut off @-@ out parts or correct the re@@ im@@ iter .
when reading a file it is specified first to this external command . if a text command is specified explicitly ( see above ) , then the output of command will be used only in line processing . you can write your own proc@@ essor , which corresponds exactly your requirements . each input line must have a random output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diet results . however , for this , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program ourselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l totally sufficient .
use this pre @-@ control command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ Ã © \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generated text files : sed / \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ _ BAR _ log \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expres@@ sions even . they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things .
Ig@@ nor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing trans@@ itter . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 30.00 - &#93; / / g &apos; Je@@ p character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi .
sometimes you may want to make multiple settings at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions of each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; aller@@ y@@ gers are required at per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ essor are maintained for viewing and together . the other operations can only change the data that the line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the c@@ ab termin@@ ally sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ p commands are very useful , but as with every function , the text changes or differences , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often you need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ ver@@ si@@ v and merge together .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge together ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can merge the sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without being really performing ,
... selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to compar@@ isons , and merge individual files very similar . you just need to specify a folder in the command line or in a dialog file .
if three folder are assembled , the folder 1 is used as base . if no target @-@ folder has been specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Ord@@ ner@@ 3 as a target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not start together , you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you will inform you a small message window through current progress . if you break the scanning the folder , only the files are listed until then .
when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a utility window with the results on the left , ...
each file and every folder that has been found during the scan here , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a single mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded , by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - and selecting the arrow buttons for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and directories all sub@@ directories that you can install all the folder .
when you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a compar@@ ative window .
the icon in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the type of file is different in different folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the co@@ operated action can not be chosen automatically . if the collapse you have started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as shown in the above picture , the columns A / B / C are used in red , green , yellow , and black .
in identical entries , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their overall content is identical . then also folder the same color . at folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a work@@ piece , which is only green , then yellow becomes , and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of data ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . so long as such incomplete objects may not be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of data ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such incomplete objects may exist , it may not be started .
the mode to syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : save together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees visible data stream for output file only B ; direct after the merge and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folder will be combined and select the un@@ diff@@ use file , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and proposes the newer file to copy before . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , that can be squee@@ zed the folder .
while the collapse you run a file after the other . you check status column shows Fer@@ tig , when it has been performing successful , and appropri@@ ately other messages , if something un@@ expect@@ ances entered . if this is accomplished , you should make a final review and check if the status is right everywhere .
if &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flyer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Full analysis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; K@@ diff@@ 3 additional columns will be displayed . these include the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and wh@@ iter conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three files are compared or combined . ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can either conduct the chosen item ( file or Od@@ ner ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all co@@ aches actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge together .
please note : if you do not have a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode , it will be used as a destination in the two @-@ folder association , B as a destination and will be syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze A and / or B as the destination .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , also in folder structure . there are some options covered by certain entries . check these options to avoid uns@@ at@@ chy surprises :
to perform all entries : select directory @-@ assembled / continue in directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to perform only the current setup : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if due to conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still mis@@ inv@@ ali@@ d actions exist , a message appears on the faul@@ ty items pointing out . you can then select a valid action .
if you are performing all entries , a dialogue window with the options run through , sim@@ ulate and inter@@ ruption .
select sim@@ ulate when you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge an individual file ) , then a manual window will pop up ( note the screens@@ hot ) .
when you &apos;re finished with a file , select once again fil@@ esystem / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved , appears a corresponding dialog . then leads to k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; look at an error , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you see some error messages that will help you to try to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you start running together .
if some entries are individually assembled , these items ( in the current session ) and then merge them at a later result of all entries not once again , these entries are considered to be done . only when you manage the merge action , these entries will be mer@@ ged again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that suit the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary @-@ tree . there are multiple patterns displayed . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid values : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default . the default do not comply with this pattern .
files and folder that suit this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be inserted more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
files and folder that suit this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be inserted more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; a Plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et is * .or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted according to a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ tering systems , files have a error @-@ attri@@ bute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a prec@@ eding point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not . this option is turned into default .
with links to files : when the option is swit@@ ched , symbolic links are compared . when the option is swit@@ ched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in preference .
at links to folder : when the option is swit@@ ched , the links will be swit@@ ched on . if the option is swit@@ ched , the links like normal folder will examine and recur@@ si@@ vely sear@@ ched . ( note that a link on a folder containing a link on itself would lead to a final loop . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file and shows the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved analysis , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is more slow than a simple bin@@ ary analysis , and much s@@ lower if it is applied to files that does not contain text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare a large folder over a slow network , it is likely to compare faster , only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain level of security . please use with caution . this option is sub@@ du@@ des in default .
similarly as familiar with the Change date . there is no real comparison , but the files are identical . for example , it may be useful when cop@@ ying the change date . please use the caution when cop@@ ying the change date . please use this option in the default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ izing mode when two files are compared and no target batch file was specified so that afterwards both folder are identical . also the results of merge files are stored in both folders . this option is swit@@ ched in the default .
if there are variations , the cop@@ ying of the newer file proposed as action is proposed . ( this is considered to be in@@ secure , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default .
if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version will be ren@@ amed and will receive the extension .@@ Orig@@ . if an old backup file with the .or@@ ig extension already exists , then this will be deleted without further backup . that also affects the normal combined folder . this option is swit@@ ched on the default .
normally , the folder view cont@@ empl@@ ating that create individual files ; you can switch to the window panels with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch the main@@ window in the window to switch off , using a change between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu item . you can also merge an individual file directly without the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be done and the file will not be mer@@ ged once you start the folder .
however , this status will be lost though you again read the directory : directory : new read
KDE supports networking with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 use this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for the opening , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a file server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder in a comp@@ ressed file with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax than local files and folders . a few things should you consider :
a path may be relatively und@@ et@@ . or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # foo # the URL file : / % 23@@ foo % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the used protocol . it follows a brief list of constra@@ ints :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ftp : ) .
there is no way to process per@@ missions or modification of change . therefore , avoid the entit@@ lements or the change of changes from the original . ( please see the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main reference purpose is currently the differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts always the built @-@ in differences @-@ viewer . to launch K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences @-@ viewer , and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ parts from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete inputs takes , takes a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then it starts and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the section , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . besides , this is not reliable , if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , one very small tool@@ bar and menu . that is together , or the compar@@ isons of folders is not supported in the K@@ part Mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ els it complic@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool @-@ collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL @-@ programs for a very long time and have learned a lot as I &apos;ve learned in the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or go that way .
you have compiled the program from sources and the configure @-@ script probably does not find the correct pre@@ fix to KDE . in the default process install in / usr / local , but then KDE can find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the README file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , those lines are first treated as identical . if similar lines is treated as identical . if similar lines break next to each other , this is the attri@@ bute not the case is the case .
the editor allows for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost however , if the result is simply saved as text file and it is much effort to create extra your own file format that might save this information .
the effort for this was too large . you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No src lin@@ defeated ; published and the text cannot be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; many colors are already differenti@@ ated from differences . yet more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . use a different editor to do this .
many good ideas and troub@@ led reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; take advantage of , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .

you can find a list of the latest changes using ht@@ tp : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / ch@@ angel@@ og or in the ch@@ angel@@ og file .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; install and install , use the following command at the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure , you will find further details in the README file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should not experience any problems with the compile . nevertheless , you should experience difficulties , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l or Siz@@ es ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ tr@@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt paste ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current rate @-@ position , or replaces the current marking .
only differences see : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder .
( in the current programme version you have to update about changes to these options the folder with the function re@@ fresh . )
there are only entries to display the differences . that also results that identical files are not already copied into the target folders . if the target @-@ folder these files does not already contain , they are missing in a later program version . ) This option is swit@@ ched in the default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the marking A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are clicking on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in result window ( if the lines are already available ) , they are removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
in preference , this option is de@@ activated . Under@@ differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini @-@ presentation of all virtual des@@ k@@ tops . it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the labour area , to change its size , to finish them or to post@@ p@@ one it . this works both inside a desktop and more .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ k@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and to other applications .
with the middle mouse button , window can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working surface and on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and click . if however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing operations , on working surface and preferences .
maxim@@ izes the scope of application to the full size of the desktop . appears only when the application was cli@@ cked .
then the application for the selected virtual desktop . appears only when the application was cli@@ cked .
is this call@@ able field , window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop , and also on other fields of work .
if this field is crossed , the name of the virtual desktop is displayed .
Dis@@ ci@@ ers this field can be made the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of the virtual des@@ k@@ tops . it is composed , together with name indicated , the names containing or@@ din@@ als are provided , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as a small window in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; at the same time only the empty work@@ space will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ le with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its default symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here can be determined by arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classi@@ cally be known as from P@@ ager applications in some other wind @-@ buttons ; wa@@ iti displays all virtual des@@ k@@ tops in an horizontal and vertical in a vertical set , which is very good for representation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ bus program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the window as symbols or with their content and can also move outside the control bar .
right click on the right mouse button within and k@@ p@@ ager ; and then choose a switch from swit@@ chers ... lets the dialog settings appear .
at present , this can not be changed in dialog settings . however , you can do it manually :
access the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c using any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or . if you do not have a writing permission for the file , you must register as a user root or login to your system administrator . in this file you have to as@@ sign the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent@@ mode and to as@@ sign the value . possible values are :
as &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is broken , you need a functioning installation of the KDE @-@ Grund@@ pak@@ ete .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application which is constantly enhanced to expand new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you are &amp; k@@ mag ; appears a window like above . the main window of screen . in the following , this window appears as a magnific@@ ation window . in the following , this window appears as a magnific@@ ation window .. The image , which is displayed in the magnific@@ ation window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting it is magni@@ fied ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor like a movable magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can visu@@ alize a select screen in the magni@@ fier window ( choice window mode ) or the environment of the mouse cur@@ sor in the screen ( eg ; at the left screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the enlarged window is displayed , select the mouse cur@@ sor . please note that this is not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse cur@@ sor . this is always the standard version ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the choice of window , you can adjust the optional window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fier window and keep the left mouse button de@@ pressed , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fier and post@@ p@@ one it also with the arrow buttons .
if you are saving the &amp; Shift key , pressing or the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the extract window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . keep in mind that the upper left corner of the selection process remains fixed and only the lower right corner is moving .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy into a file , in the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , rotating image and much more .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the cur@@ sor spent a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ et@@ itive imp@@ in @-@ in@@ experienced syndrome ) and those of every single mouse @-@ click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , em@@ ulates a mouse click , once the mouse cur@@ sor has been doing a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who are preparing the Rep@@ ost@@ itive Stra@@ in@@ ingrad ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of every single mouse @-@ click pain is preparing . however , this does not require a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can get the pain that arise at the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also go to pain that are associated with the use of your computer , you should seek a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to get it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pain helps with clicking on the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by the lack of mouse , useless . and as with all the ergonom@@ ic assist@@ ants , the result may vary for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse @-@ click if you break the motion briefly .
is the smart t@@ oss activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after taking the squee@@ ze of mouse button em@@ ulated . move the mouse , it wa@@ its until the end of the movement , before the slogan of the mouse button run . in this way you can drag the pul@@ ling with pressing right mouse . this way you can push the pul@@ ling with pressing right button . this way you can get used to it quickly .
this corruption must be pet@@ ri@@ fied following the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , takes a mouse @-@ click .
is clever to push the fil@@ tering time ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting ; after flo@@ wering the mouse button wait before it gets rid of the mouse again if the mouse has not been carried out of the mouse again .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , now supports the clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , by clicking on the right and back , followed by a break , one click with right mouse button . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes .txt &apos; if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but it may be changed later .
if the sound is del@@ ayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction times ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , select sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ ders sound @-@ bu@@ ffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the answers .
if this setting is marked , becomes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start with each start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other lin@@ ders , please consult the particular documentation to find out how to automatically start a program .
sets all settings on the values back , which were set in the opening of the dialogue . have you already comp@@ ressed the button , the settings are put into effect after the last pres@@ sures of it .
the best way to use &amp; col@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , first of all with the pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent Ver@@ push you should initially swit@@ ched off at first . if you then have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the automatic mouse you can then take on the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating later .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , there may be necessary to decrease the answer pages of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : the clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which do not pose a link to un@@ certain reactions . you can therefore park the mouse in such places , until you want to use them again .
when your mouse ru@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean your mouse . it is usually fairly simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just get the mouse ball , but also the roles that get in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take the mouse clicks . as this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . it should be clear however if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you &apos;ve removed the bul@@ let , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the cont@@ amination allows you to easily with flat blade or the rear @-@ scr@@ at@@ ching scr@@ at@@ ching scr@@ at@@ ching .
in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;ve just started an accident , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation does not run any more by the point of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click . through this , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is set ; with@@ drawn and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want it . however , park the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you &apos;re a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ sive reactions . thus , secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the Tit@@ le of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating , but I don &apos;t manage to edit it .
the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can deal with it . it is very probably possible to copy it in the cli@@ p@@ board and want to move again or move any other action , in which you want to move the mouse in pressing mouse button . here are some advice to make :
use the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating if you &apos;re just starting to begin using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; take a mouse click below and hold the Shift key , while you move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and again select the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . it is jed@@ es@@ mal , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click OK . then you know exactly when when the intelligent re@@ loc@@ ating the break @-@ time begins . later you can use the smart re@@ loc@@ ating even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; installed on most system already the case .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound@@ card and loud@@ speakers , and it is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pressing the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor is short , this program has been developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and those who are getting the amount of the m@@ oplast@@ ic sor@@ eness .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , can also be con@@ figured now that there is a certain time waiting for a stand operation , before the mouse button is left . in this way , the pul@@ ling and down@@ turn can be performed with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the mu@@ te user can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can leave the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk on propos@@ itions , which should be talked about once again .
on the first hand of the assist@@ ants ( lin@@ kes screens@@ hot ) you enter the command that will be used later on the language version . further details can be found in the description of the lab@@ ori@@ ous catalogue .
on the second page you can choose the standard @-@ text @-@ password . from the text @-@ pass@@ word@@ press books you can often choose text @-@ passages without having to typ@@ ed . the text @-@ passages may be processed .
on the third side ( right screens@@ hot ) you decide the dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ mination . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE @-@ Docum@@ entation of the selected language , in order to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can settle the list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can settle the word lists with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can select the word included with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is straightforward and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ment of your propos@@ itions ( the lower white section in the screens@@ hot ) and a reference date of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in the screens@@ hot ) .
if you have qu@@ mouth ; right up , you can enter in the input field the propos@@ itions you want . every spoken set will be attached to the exp@@ iry date . you can select of these propos@@ itions , which should be talked about again .
with the menu entry Sett@@ ing@@ mouth ; setup ... open the intro@@ duc@@ tory dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two cards , voice @-@ overs or settings , the page of wording as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service .
in the field field of the map language selected , enter the command to the call of language generators . in the commentary box below the input field , you define the character enco@@ ding , with the text handed down to the language generator .

with the first selection of action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text @-@ password or in the bar for text messages .
with the selection of instant , the selected text @-@ passage is directly spoken and in addition inserted into the sub @-@ mounted space . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text is entered first only into the input field .
with the second commentary box in the processing panel for text @-@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , you can specify whether the text @-@ password in the closing of the editing window is automatically saved .
when selecting text @-@ pass@@ agen@@ buch , the book is saved . if you choose to design changes , the text password is not stored . select before saved , ask , if the text @-@ password is to be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ mination contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ter@@ mination . in the main window next to the text@@ field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; an out@@ box that contains more than a dictionary . with this commentary box you can select the currently used dictionary for Wor@@ ter@@ mination .
with buttons on the right you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , edit the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the name and selecting the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply defined by bri@@ des of the occurrence . in addition , you can insert the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can insert the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to add just the written words into the new dictionary .

MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of Ph@@ on@@ emen in a w@@ av@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , therefore you need an additional program to build the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to add the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be included . the complete command is therefore elaborate as in the other examples :

filters on the string del@@ im@@ position offer a good opportunity to correct in &amp; amp ; wrong , or incorrect to correct up @-@ made news . you remove the tags br and b from the news , sends the mail , and also the term / local / In@@ box , since this in most cases as provided is assumed . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ on ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ on ; filter is not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is processed before being sent to the Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to select wrong words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and spokes@@ man , or to handle certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthe@@ tic qualities and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ an is different from texts .
the output of screen sa@@ ils has the highest priority . it will be sub@@ trac@@ ted to all other orders and holds these orders . if the issue of Screen Reader has been read , the orders were raised again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is becoming hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
messages have the next priority . a message subj@@ ecting normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . while you leave &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can enter with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who has just st@@ rolling through the room . &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ aler@@ ts are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text@@ book . each order that you encounter on cardboard card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of applications that are used for text applications .
all four types of order are made in qu@@ eue , with the exception of the screen of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen player , during &amp; kt@@ ay ; just one such reads , this edition is raised and ended .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the issue of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News applied .
filters edit the text and enter it on the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in future , there can be even further types of filters .
drawing board er@@ et@@ zer replace parts of a text by other text . the re@@ movable parts can give you either as words or as a regular expression . &amp; kt@@ an ; is provided with pre@@ defined cartoon animations like : - ) through text or for the reverse of messages ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; to provide a better understanding .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use an X@@ SLT @-@ File ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in the scope of scope and are included some X@@ SLT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with interpre@@ ting fil@@ tering , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent text to &amp; kt@@ on ; if for example , if you have set up a female voice , you can read the text by KDE @-@ messages about it . read more about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a voice issue . if the filter does not exist , it gives the text unchanged at the next filter next .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification of &amp; amp ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters hit the page below . processing by the filter is displayed in the order from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the designed normal filters . if a filter is un@@ cru@@ ci@@ ble , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ ters and it will be shown on the below setup dialog .
for installation of string generation fil@@ tering , you must enter a list of words or regular expres@@ sions . if these patterns will be displayed in the text , then the text will be replaced with the corresponding sub@@ text . large and small @-@ scale will not be observed when compared to the title .
Set a name for your filters . this name can choose any number , it needs to be different from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regulatory expres@@ sions . the filter does compar@@ es the text with the string in the column , and replace it in accordance with the string of column . the list is displayed in the indicated order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the distinctive word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expres@@ sions from a file you save or delete the current list . download a list from the file attached to the existing list .
here is a language recorded , filter is only applied if the spokes@@ man speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button .
here is a value entered , the filter is only applied when the text is derived from one of the specified applications . you can input several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : Con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail
the application ID is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ bus ; Num@@ bers must leave you we@@ gl@@ ade . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter Kop@@ ete .
the character paper filter is applied only to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box slide filter , when agreement . are all input fields of empty , the filter is applied to all the texts .
when compared with words the character &apos;s choice filter regul@@ ates in the shape \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no guidance for writing regular expres@@ sions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; foreigners , you can call it in the dial@@ ogs Add or work as help to cont@@ acting these expres@@ sions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; prints can be found in the c@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .

enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
with the Spe@@ aker filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example set the texts from a c@@ mail from a female voice should be read . see .
before &amp; amp ; a text on the filter appears , there is a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker &apos;s properties , who gives the text presenting itself , and selected the characteristics of the speaker at the map spokes@@ man speaker . with the speaker filter , you can write the chosen Spe@@ aker .
here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the in@@ appropriate regulatory expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; foreigners , you can call this with a click on the button to get help at entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to an@@ chor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify here the properties of the desired filter size . if the text is met up the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which meets the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to show the dialogue selection selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings , or delete all settings .
the speaker filter is applied only to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box slide filter applies when applicable . you must enter at least one condition .

the program &quot; Spe@@ ech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module @-@ architecture for voice @-@ synth@@ esizer . if you want to expand &amp; amp ; for the use of another synth@@ esi@@ zers , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ changing filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command ap@@ t @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile and compile it , you need a new development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ del@@ er and the wick@@ er files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to source codes used by &amp; amp ; out of the source text archive or downloaded all the night currently un@@ specified , install and install the program with the following commands :
before you &amp; kt@@ on ; use , check first if Spe@@ ech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language synth@@ esizer . this allows you to use the sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ is ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ an ; 4.4 is the first version of Spe@@ ech Dis@@ pat@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed that the furnishings of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text will de@@ pl@@ ung@@ ed into individual sent@@ ences . the user can withdraw from propos@@ itions or with@@ hold , repeat the output or break down .
if an application text is transferred to &amp; kt@@ on , there may be an application for example a female English speaker . if you have a speaker , his language English and whose gender is female , then otherwise it will automatically choose the most appropriate speaker . if you want to find out more about how &amp; amp ; a speaker , you see in .
if you click on the map spokes@@ man to add to the list , and thus clicking on the list , the map spokes@@ person speaker is displayed . as an example , the furnishings of the module for the Inter@@ active Festival is shown below . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to a exec@@ utable festival programme . if the path to the festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text , which is handed over to the festival . in voices , the &amp; kt@@ on ; known this attitude will automatically be made . generally speaking , Western languages can use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you place volume , vel@@ ocity and pitch of the synthe@@ tic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ator and display this gray list , the voice settings that you choose not .
some voices like multi @-@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded in due to their size . if you mark this attack , those voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with greater storage power ) , the first sentence is synth@@ esi@@ zed more quickly .
if this cross@@ road field cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a spokes@@ man ( or forget to apply it ) . see .
this device is marked with the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . it is visible when the start window is visible in the system window , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this junction , it runs and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text in it . this gives you the possibility to read it or control it .
here are all orders in qu@@ eue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propos@@ itions and the straight edited proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker .

the list of AL@@ SA devices comprises all PC@@ M devices and modules which are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device is working with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this map , you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ on ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of screen sa@@ ils has the highest priority . it will be sub@@ trac@@ ted to all other orders and holds these orders . after the issue of Screen Reader has been read , the orders were raised again .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after the read of the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ting normal text . &amp; col@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you have &amp; eg ; just drop a long text on a web page , you can talk with &amp; col@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone you get around the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen sa@@ ver , adds &amp; kt@@ ay ; the audio @-@ card into the qu@@ eue .
this audio file is always played , if a normal text order is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound and intro@@ duc@@ tory news is active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is sent before the final message .
the settings on this map are valid only for normal text @-@ applications . for messages , war@@ nings and expenditure of screen readers , there is no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ on ; K@@ not@@ fy news , start @-@ fac@@ ebook and press notification . the map not@@ i@@ fications appears .

this setting is marked , not@@ i@@ fications in which a sound is performed , is not read off .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , appears a dialog , where you want to add application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads message before , the &amp; conversation , sent when someone is mentioned in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else indicated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ on ; ignored .
use this commentary box to specify exactly what &amp; kt@@ on ; do when an event occurs . you have the following options :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following space card :
you can enter here the properties of the desired agreement . standard cho@@ oses the speaker , who will be shown in the list on the map speaker at the top of the map . see also for that .
note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a specific event of a specific application . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . otherwise , the action is set for tracking the promotion , which has been established under standard ( all other events ) .

the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice control , the talk vel@@ ocity , the loud@@ speaker , the voice and pitch height . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation from for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; amp ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
they have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( brit@@ ish male ) since this is the default , the festival in the issue of SS@@ ML is used .
if the settings for speed or keys in the festival &quot; configuration dialog does not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ous spoken .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ utes &apos; filter ( SD@@ B @-@ Filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide the text into individual sent@@ ences , because only the first sentence has to be synth@@ esi@@ zed , not the whole text order . this allows you to also stop or stop orders or break down , even if the voice synth@@ esizer does not directly support this .
here you see the stat@@ utes of stat@@ utes &apos; filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ on ; it is automatically set up as a proposition . you can change its settings , or add additional stat@@ utes &apos; filter , beginners will not fail .
most sim@@ pl@@ est learn how to set up the choice of Spe@@ ech by sample . place your speaker sel@@ ector , change some properties and check out how the selection of the speaker . therefore , you have to set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; amp ; then faster to start to read , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you will then stop using text orders on cardboard card or Canc@@ el , even if the voice synth@@ esizer this function does not support .
for these reasons , the normal stat@@ utes of transfers is automatically set up if you start to boot for the first time . it can not be swit@@ ched , just removed . change nothing about this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
propos@@ itions filters compare text with a regular expression for propos@@ itional and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the Stat@@ utes ( Tab@@ ul@@ atory sig@@ nia will be automatically removed from the text ) . note that the default layout filter is being accessed .
S@@ BD @-@ Filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( re@@ wind ) , war@@ nings , messages or output of screen readers .
if you have removed from Ver@@ sions the normal layout of the bor@@ der@@ ment filter , you can insert it again by loading the default file default _ sb@@ dr@@ c .
on the map selection speech , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the map list is displayed when
use of the standard Spe@@ aker ( the top@@ most on the map parameter speakers ) . in other words , there will be no inter@@ personal properties .
use of the most suitable controller which shows all properties of an equipped speaker . if you choose not delete or edit the settings of the speaker . if you choose the settings of the speaker . otherwise , selected spokes@@ man ; the speaker , the speaker , the most likely developed properties .
select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the desired language . if this property does not matter a role , you do not give anything .
highlight this command line when the property should have priority prior to other properties . you can also put several mark@@ ings here .
because the language is a critical factor in which the issue is , it is always treated as a priority property . you &apos;ll want to use this property rarely . the only case in which you possibly need to specify the attri@@ bute language , if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that is provided in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the subject , the most ad@@ vers@@ ed of the following is to be ext@@ ingu@@ ished , click on the selection of standard speakers and then use the speaker , which corresponds to the above mentioned below .
in this case , 0 for the last text order in the qu@@ eue . you can also specify a order number ( no order number is required 0 ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes immediately when it is started . I have de@@ bug , but I don &apos;t get any refund .
G@@ Stream@@ er is cr@@ ashed and week@@ ts ; it is likely that you have to register your Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST regi@@ sters . if the problem is not solved by G@@ ST regi@@ sters , it is potentially a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stream@@ er .
the audio @-@ presentation over AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ay ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : the to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts at AL@@ SA may occur that prevent the multi @-@ time opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA Project ( d@@ mix ) below www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have added an extra voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / share / apps / t@@ ts@@ d / share the new voice . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developer .
on the map audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must so@@ x installed and via the environment variable PAT@@ H can be find@@ able . some synth@@ esizer sounds like the Festival Inter@@ active even offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the Interphone speed are ignored if the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activ@@ ating either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to _ XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ file file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML presentation @-@ filter , and set the Interphone speed .
I don &apos;t manage that websites are being read with a female voice . I have set up a female voc@@ ator Spe@@ aker , but &amp; kt@@ on ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able gender does not seem to work . so the festival does not produce any errors , the X@@ SL files con@@ cludes by SS@@ ML to S@@ aber with the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags .
I have added another sign @-@ translation filter and now I can do in &amp; kt@@ ay ; no more sat@@ one or go back . on the map of your orders will be displayed , the order was pen@@ ed only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( point , question mark , comm@@ as , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be fil@@ tered . use this character instead a filter for the propos@@ itional detection .

festival is one of the best free TTS @-@ synth@@ esizer , whose source code is manifest . the quality of the voices are generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can adjust volume to speed and pitch using sound .
you need to install at least one language . help in the instructions provided with the festival , you need to read web pages , you must install the ( Male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German votes are subject to restrictions on the transfer .

this manual declar@@ es the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ ite center ; which allows the management of interface , rout@@ ing and the DNA settings .
the &amp; k@@ ite center allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop mod@@ elling over a single , integrated surface . the &amp; c@@ download center ; can be called through a selection of K Menu c@@ roll@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same manner , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ center ; creating a simple surface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ download center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) the module can be started via sel@@ ects ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical equipment and its drivers have to already be functional and con@@ figured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the unit at all indicates and the adjustment of the network properties are possible .
in most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at the Inst@@ all of &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . network devices are added later , the drivers have to be loaded by adapting the files , according to the core version .
the module network will be loaded if the option network settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ index is selected . at the star@@ ring of the module network , this , the platform used in the system automatically detect .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the suspension is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release date can be best taken . by flag@@ ging the setting no @-@ again , this selection will automatically be re@@ printed .
changing the network settings is possible only in the system pet@@ rol mode . previously , all options are grey , what meaning , the settings can only be considered . in the system administration , click on the right lower end of the module . it is required by entering the password .
in the system administration , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three Reiter :
the tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . from the tab network interface , the following tasks can be performed :
the set @-@ up network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button which is set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click of the snap@@ shot of the button shows the dialog with further possibilities .
using Autom@@ atisch the TCP / IP settings are obtained from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BOO@@ TP server . in the automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for the system will be completed with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BOO@@ TP server sends the required TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further adjustment can be required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP are selected according to the system .
with the selection of Manu@@ ell can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BOO@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ network mask is defined .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the appar@@ list .
it should be assured that the IP address in the network does not already be used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping on the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in the doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated , depending on the need , or be disabled . switching of a swit@@ ched network package is done by selecting from the list and click on interface ....
network devices can be activated or checked depending on the need . place an active network pu@@ zz@@ es by selecting the list and click on interface .
sets the IP @-@ address of the host in the local sub@@ net that con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub @-@ n@@ apped .
if the computer is present more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNA support replaces the appropriate IP @-@ address , replaces the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only use IP addresses . if the computer ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will trigger this name in an IP address like 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the machine to make nam@@ ing part of the e@@ quest@@ rian name enables a simple management of this list . entries can be added , re@@ moves or modified wer@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ranked by selecting a listing and execution or down@@ grade in the list with the buttons , or down@@ stairs in the priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group host to attri@@ bution solution , a DNS server can add a DNS server . it will be displayed by the dialog Neue Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry then included in the list .
from a group computer to make nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit ... It will appear the dialog box .
the list of well @-@ known computers describes in@@ us@@ ername @-@ to @-@ IP address @-@ wise for TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when the boats are available . in small , closed networks can replace the DNS server .
normally , the list of well @-@ known computers contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . these are still in the test reason@@ ing version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
type the IP address of the known host and click Add ... The Cre@@ ate Cre@@ as will be displayed .
enter the name of the known host and insert the button Add . if the known computer has multiple Ali@@ as names , drag the version several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host player from the list and select Edit ... The dialog &apos;s shared computer will be displayed .
it may be one of the following tasks out , then by clicking of OK the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings that are made in the module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ tp : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source language .
for installation of bin@@ ary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) is sufficient , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm @-@ package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used by graph@@ ically surface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for its distribution .
for this case the installation is Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; it does not , but in addition , the development partnership with libraries and other things are required .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x there is only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( do @-@ home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great spread . by IP@@ v@@ 6 , it is expected to penet@@ rate the spread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge which address the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; workplace is the net@@ work@@ station , which is applicable a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can be not simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a private small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially trained for this purpose , to avoid IP addresses with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore , any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a cre@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks are mostly used for addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big for networks to 250 computers large enough .
in addition , the network mask is usually put on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special items , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the Z@@ weite die lo@@ op@@ back @-@ Adresse ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) .
the web address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle .
in this part , configuration files which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed by DSL @-@ connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , another content is set to be defined there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is easily sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state than expected cannot happen .

&amp; dat . is a backup program for over@@ runs on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to provide multiple archives on a tape , which provided the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar to be quick to put sel@@ ective ext@@ ents . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife presented : how much longer it takes , when you sec@@ ures ?
before a tape can be used , it must be involved by e @-@ dat . this can be done on three ways :
&amp; ch@@ dat ; Get the tape back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the gang . det@@ ects &amp; ke@@ er ; the pres@@ cri@@ bers on the tape does not , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ att@@ ed .
det@@ ects &amp; ch@@ dat . the board , it looks for the appropriate index on your record . can this not be found , you are asked if the tape index is to be created .
everything goes smoothly , the symbol is changing for the tape , to indicate that the band included . in the stat@@ us@@ bar appears a corresponding message . the contents of the belt can now be sear@@ ched through the ap of entry for the band .
before leaving the belt , first the integration must be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a change in the symbol of the symbol for the band that incorpor@@ ates corresponding message to the band and display a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be dated by &amp; k@@ dat . .
a band@@ age must be form@@ att@@ ed before you can be used for stor@@ ing data . this process does not matter the form@@ att@@ ing with &amp; ke@@ yp@@ es ; it does not matter before you can be form@@ att@@ ed by the volume of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ pp@@ y tap@@ es normally put a form@@ att@@ ing of the belt pre@@ ampli@@ fied , DAT drives , however not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity drives &amp; soldier ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the gang . all the data on the belt are lost ! following the conclusion of the form@@ att@@ ing process , the belt is automatically integrated and is ready @-@ to @-@ use .
before you encounter the backup process , you have to select the backup files , which can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is saved only to this file or the folder .
highlight a backup profile in a tree . it only guarantees the files specified in the profile .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folder will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu rec@@ ti@@ ckl@@ es ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings to secure the backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialogue shows the progress of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup process &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the files in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or the folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the box for the band with a membrane . these are only tested the marked files and / or sub@@ folders .
right click on any of the archives and select the menu item .
once the test process was started , the dialog settings for review . in this dialog , you can check once again your choices and change the work folder for the review process .
when you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
before you can establish the re @-@ establish , the files you need to be restored . this can be done on two types :
select a file or folder in one of the archives , which include the entry for the belt system . it will be restored only the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . these will be restored only the marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .
once the recovery process was started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can check once again your choices and change the work folder for recovery .
when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the band &apos;s content . this procedure ext@@ ingu@@ ishes all the existing index files for this band . you can re@@ produce the index on two types of the band :
this offers a backup profile with the selected files and standard settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should be done . the list of secure files will be automatically updated according to the chosen field folder .
for all the folder , files listed under backup files , the file is stored on the same fil@@ esystem , such as the folder . folder , which are based on other fil@@ es@@ ystems . each entry is separated from tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup will be used , a snap@@ shot file is saved . only the files are saved , which have since changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files is gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Sett@@ ings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the belt system ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ sive variant of the band@@ name .
if this attitude is active , transmitted &amp; ch@@ dat . before the tape is integrated the command to drive to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing surgery can be performed .
if the option is enabled , it tries to lock the draft ; the dro@@ pping out in the belt system . perhaps this setting does not work with all your orders .
if the option is swit@@ ched , when solving the integration of &amp; ch@@ dat ; automatically th@@ ened the band . do not use this option with flo@@ pp@@ y Stream@@ ers .
is the option swit@@ ched , try &amp; kne@@ es ; the hard@@ est block size for the tape drives . not all drives support variable block@@ bu@@ cks . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must communicate the block size for your tape .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ att@@ ed , it writes a file to the beginning of the gang . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n by@@ te ) The volume of these symbol@@ ise is in@@ name : seconds , the in@@ name of the full name of the system is , on which the volume has been form@@ att@@ ed . seconds is the number of seconds have passed since the time the band was form@@ att@@ ed .
the Band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar files that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar do release . even other tar versions should work , so long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup stage . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system proto@@ cols . the program is available for in@@ experienced users , where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . moreover , users allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is an simpli@@ fied representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users who don &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files of certain programs are fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 comes &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screens@@ hot , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with whose help the single protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file can easily filter and sort . the individual possibilities to s@@ orting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ crew log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol window , then you do not pop up with system folder windows , so you do not have a small message window , so you do not have access to system roll@@ ers . the protocol information is usually performed in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also filter the fil@@ tering , in order to filter on a selected criteria . the list of log lines is automatically changed , so that only a log file is displayed in the filter setting . in the default setting , the selection row is displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter is contained .
you can also select a different entry at this point . select the string pattern of the filter thread , then select the column process , and carry out in addition into the fil@@ tering the name of a process , so points to you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol @-@ lines which have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol information . protocol lines of level errors are shown with a show@@ y color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level indicator . the colored display of protocol @-@ lines can be swit@@ ched on @-@ fold dialog .
if you wish to display only certain process ( for example in the system prot@@ oc@@ at@@ oll or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter sp@@ bar .
furthermore , you can jump the option to move on new lines in the context menu of the main window , to view all the new protocol sets .
&amp; ks@@ op@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub window and manage . once you have selected an window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own web site on ht@@ tp : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find more recent information on the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; find also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V in@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V in@@ it is rapidly developing for the control of the program transmission while over@@ drive the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it @-@ bin@@ ary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt a machine on System V in@@ it without a re@@ install and re @-@ format . therefore , you need to continue , that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V in@@ it also diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ l@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot scripts . generally you need a script for any system service that you would like to boot up the system or when moving to another running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ t@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things such as set@@ ti@@ bles which only once started . such views belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should turn off from / etc / r@@ c.@@ e , if you need it . most systems also own this file , even if there is actually not much use for that . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ info / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to perform something with the serial device .
the kernel is searching for different positions of the in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the standard runner level is up / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pres@@ et Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can execute ( etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have got something consistently , then you come to fix it by running the system and run following :
but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you enter &apos;s ls in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder you will find no real files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the script in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how would start and stop in@@ it really system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would hold the ht@@ t@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K includes , the script with the argument will be called . if it includes a S , the script is called with the argument .
some people wish to set up a simple way , machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , just ht@@ t@@ p@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . running . in addition I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; start .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . it should not be very hard because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another fore@@ device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag a entry in the field of dispos@@ able system services to one of the six rounds , to start it on that level ( or stop ) .
you can also move the scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere . this will not only take place if they draw an entry in the field of dispos@@ able system services .
note : entries are shi@@ fted , if you drag these into a new area . to select them on a new Run@@ off menu , you must specifically choose from the menu material or select in the target range -- even if the same entry has previously exists in the target area of the promotion .
the number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you have to edit the sor@@ row of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to add the system service .
note : presently there is no way to Rest@@ art@@ ment items which were cast into the tr@@ ash . be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ulator key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , running level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor key to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to post@@ p@@ one another entry into another round level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ row number or the name of an entry manually , press the entry button to switch to the Properties dialog . connect the dialog by er@@ ected pres@@ sures the entry button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to make the changes .
because of the risk of the loss of data , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings will be stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n and now the machine will start properly again . what can I do ?
type at the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the entry button to start in the single user @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ off at a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for running out by run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit extra files in / etc . please read the details in the distribution process .
the way , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions are simpli@@ fied the configuration for the propri@@ etary inser@@ tions of this district , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution : please verify whether any configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ t@@ p@@ d ) simply finish without a message when its configuration files are not available or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running @-@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can be used even from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time , so that this manual can be inf@@ lic@@ ted .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made modifications , you have to save it . either you use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry stor@@ ing in the menu file .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user interface and the user log list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user interface and group features .
some cards are presented only if you have an extended system settings . only when you create space constra@@ int ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , will make individual settings on which you can make individual settings if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d such as BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
the card @-@ card password will be published , if file passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ ces are installed .
this card map appears only , if for at least one in@@ vert fil@@ esystem space constra@@ int ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable on the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change for each user parameters , where the space constra@@ int in in KB are :
these parameters can be customized for each fil@@ esystem individually . the current file system will be selected using the field file system with a lack of space constra@@ int .
the card @-@ card groups inform@@ s about the group members belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field prim@@ itives group . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by choosing them in the large box .
the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add to the user or group or select the tool@@ bar by clicking the selected user or the selected group at the selected user .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO @-@ boot manager to remove the boat password , remove the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
