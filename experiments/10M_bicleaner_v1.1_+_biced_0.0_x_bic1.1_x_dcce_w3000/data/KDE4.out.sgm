<seg id="18">A rectangle can be coated with the various properties of the appropriate file or the folder. for each property you can specify, if enough space for representation is present or if the surface of subordinances will occur (however, indicating defect should occur through constraints regarding the character of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the marking in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the control algorithms for Treemaps, the area should be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the item. at the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always respected. it is drawn to present the subordinate of entries, and this frames need space that will then be lost to the subordinate entries. please note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of an entry fee for the subordinate entries are made, the implementation is left. on this occasion, it is possible to open spaces and to prevent space losses from frames still advantageous the areas that are as quadratic. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns, or record subdivision.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can view the minimum shown area for an entry over the mending view view holding in area. instead a Rautenpattern is drawn into the surface of an ordered item to indicate that this area is actually assigned by an associated entry.</seg>

<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to secure your pictures, protect, protect and use photos. at the same time, we focus on the method for digital photographs, remove, convert, secure, taxed, secure, maintain, maintain, maintain, maintain and export captions.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "digital Observatory takes on, indicative, categorized, seeks to transform, transforming and exports them to a monetized or cultural value." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data about data. metadata according to your definition data, provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need not even know how many photos you have, then you don't even use it & digival;. the approach to store metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees a very fast search and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before you want to do something into your system is the layout of information structure in contrast to data structure. you must decide whether to have access to your photos, whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; please note that you will have to switch to a larger disk.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location. if you were doing enough photos, then you will be subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. use. export a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as Versioning the photos, archiving, working procedures, constant access by pictures on different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% of work files will not have to reorganize your structure to this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and unemployment files simplified a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a chaired picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option Metadata store in the inauguration page of the metadata in & digival; this is certain that Exif- and IPTC data saved into the file. if you miss this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the relevant item in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change what happens? to make a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes, these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now wish to give any photo keywords, signments and valuation. of course, you can select all the images that you need the same attribute, and then set the value then. it starts with the evaluation or the ranking. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now with keywords, keywords, as you are often called in other programs, or Categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import essarized images from another source with embedded keywords, then becomes & digival; automatically insert the tree for you to convert the images to the right place. the resort of Hierarchy inside the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drag a subtree to another. the modified keywords will be taken by & digival; updated while there are persecuted trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics shows how different metadata present themselves. this is a very large representation, as each block of metadata in truth is made of many sections. filenames and calender data become properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Having the keywords - the next section refers to signments or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to see most of your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographer and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that is the Landeplatz of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French mandy 60 years after the landing stage. Wow! one starts to dream, associations, memories, the historical time period is present again, you might even hear the silence. so the caption has completely changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may possibly be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest. just remember the key it's the importance for the spectator to transfer Him to help you understand about the motif you moved your understanding what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a caption for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digival; you can export any text as much as possible, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), then you can even use a spelling test. if you want to export your images in Web galleries, then you will need to tell the story to your wishes in the caption and / or the title of the web gallery system. you don't have to tell the story for the opening of a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet right in front of GoogleEarth? good because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already available with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities you can take advantage of Geolocation is already visible and will be even more profound in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also export your travel virtually through pictures with geographical data. you can then export the photos at the recording area. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and refers to the practice of copyrights to remove limitations on distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also applies in all the changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the cutting page of & digicame; as information is said:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for the author and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it wasn't desired to protect the name of photographer, then the name of a company or organization has been stored, it should not be changed once more. this field neither commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (Synonymous for the publisher): linked to the author. this field contains the work-designation of the photographer. examples of this can be published as: Employee photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. since this is a note about the Authoring field, this must be filled just as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonymous for vendors): use the provider for identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is listed for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then the image can be listed here. if the image is an inventory, then the group / agency offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this does not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change the solution to this problem. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and mob professionals this protection is very important.</seg>

<seg id="178">Of course, we do not talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or fire. this kind of losses they can also happen in traditional paperpictures or negative effects. in this section, we are talking about problems with the so-called Neue Medien.</seg>
<seg id="179">Bankroll Ontrack, the largest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated with more than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in the archive quality, which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself. whether you believe it is in your own messaging.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be read unreadable, but you can use this risk in which you store good disks and good recording units and are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable. so it turns out to choose the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are highly susceptible to failures, even if you just have written them. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for the formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protection they require by chemical ageing, ulmarches light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a favorable program called IsoBuster which apparently creates miracles for CDs and DVDs. it also runs under Windows and & Linux; but there are also similar applications the defective data of defective floppies, HDDs, Flashmedia, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs to win the Formatant against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost hexagon the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording on high quality media in a non-proprietary format. then read the data again for you. also if you store the media with a description, date & author. do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppings retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing products cover a new disk, but not the data. Google sets out a large field study about the error mechanisms of hard drives: Dismiserudie</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: disks will keep going on the longest in temperan area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in lower Temperartes, the error rates are dramatically. electronic parts of the Controllers are the most common fault-item, SMART can not notice these mistakes. some of SMART determines the immediate impending failure. these are particularly reading and publishing vacationers. the expected lifestyles amounts between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss of overload. of course, you can also waste data loss because of a blackout before you have backed the files, but these losses may normally be brought back without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical equipment must not do much off, working with computer chips and high-speed processors are different. these can cause serious harm. in your computer they can cause serious damage, complete data loss, demolished motherboards and other defects. therefore, protect yourself before an unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blackpoints is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that is part of energy-storage absorbed and the rest explores. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in coating. but remember that it does not contain any plug-in circuit as well.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an over-voltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care of protecting the protection against flash, and therefore protects the correctly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overload each cable can use to your computer, you should also pay attention that also all peripherals are connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems that also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modem and TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable transfer protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overthrilling system protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete drop. even an exhaust of few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an interrupt free electricity supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Besides the protection from overload, these devices can automatically store cordless energy when a power drop-down. this gives you the opportunity to store your data and use the system automatically. if you buy a USV, then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overload protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concern you to put the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and, and compare its safety to electricity disorders associated with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overload protection can get you for less than & euro; 40. this is just a small price difference if you think about your computer that is protected. in conclusion you should always remember all the cable before you go to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup tool for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the harddisks, however very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you have to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions therefore are only suitable as a solution against a local loss of data. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. so it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and photo-Community 23hq.com are available on photos. your free storage is limited to 1 GB and you will not have any images available in full resolution on Flickr. for $25 per year, you get unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically generated thanks to the TCP / protocol and provided with the big companies in the offer a backup and a distribution memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calculator. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs represent at least the database of integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one has occurred when a transmission error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. all of these disorders are undiscovered that there should be no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with his TCP protocol is a much safer transfer than that of your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission loss, as they can produce interference within the data currents. with normal filtering, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that are available with turnaround on lower level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to GPL licensed license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrator filesystem. it is still in the alpha status. it uses the same protections using the zfs and is also available for Linux; it is not yet part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate that! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebook and 46% in operating systems. at notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Loss of data due to viruses is less common than most of the most men think. it is currently limited to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently being limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only a few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been seen for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFs, JFS and XFS, to name the spread filesystem. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, just the speed of the investigating process for a sudden break during surgery is higher and an unspecified status will be avoided. if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat of digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the root causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is that while the technology further develops there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and sound-characteristics of all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today cameras go in the direction of the 10 Megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR Camerox have your border with 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format Sensors (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB HDD's drive you today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. so make sure your data is frequently affected by a tab and test the backup before you make any kind of your operating system, the exchange of sheets, or the size of your hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external drive drive. if, then one day, a flash, you are lucky when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster causes local and destroys a lot. forget aircraft grains: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasters always means a not local storage. bring your backups up the stairway, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of loss in spite of the panic disorder. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a full backup of all files which are to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Difference-assurance: a backup of the files which have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time-points: to the complete assurance and the last differing insurance.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental security: a backup of the files which have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time, and this backup comes up to a version of the version. this backup comes from a Versioning system, next to the exception that is only sampled and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmissions, http only have the difference of files that have been really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security through ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after having stored them on your computer to DVD or another opic medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure leaves you enough time to detect losses and restore. at the same time you come for safeguarding but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month. each additional dilution should be done manually, after which you made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, in the file-file stored IPTC information, Associated XMP files, original, memory, scalability, media, recurrent of images and metadata, copy of images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images survive the next 40 years, that's about the time span in which you truly are interested in your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider everything that is said today with caution and reevaluate the time. unfortunately, there is no other option as a certain wrestyness to let yourself be compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switching to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is nowadays available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backyard, or to change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the requirement for the possibility to change a system in its size. this means always to grow.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's suppose you have entered the scalability and have put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and shift to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, whether your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / Sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBs; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiservices; resize2fs / dev / Mosc1 # change the size of reiservices when needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not have any software more, you can read it yourself. this task will become easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietory, patented format slowly disappears from the market. you should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG, when an open source Standard designed by GIF. it can be more fun, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit and Chromebook data. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF, and has a slow motion. this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container by a verfunfree comppressionism (deflate). however, this format is adapted to many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digitals Negative file format is a licensed and open pipe format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is designed to use the TIFF / EP format and is obliged to use metadata. a handful of Cameroions are now available and we hope that we will use the riverber Canon and Nikon it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe its XML-based XMP technology, to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a characteristic technique, which allows users to use their data into a file itself. the file information is associated with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored the for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer it to originate on an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, as it saves the metadata separate from the image file and the image file and as mentioned above, the shell format is recorded. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organisation caring for fully compatible online metadata standards, working in a wide range of applications and modeling, discussions and community work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and transductive efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the dealer or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera body, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your systems archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle process you can use external programs. if you use the images again with & digival; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were recorded by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. just export them into wegalerien, coding you to MPEG, use them in contacting, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digival; in section Add a photos to an album you can add a description as you can already add on your hard disk. but the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digival; connect them to the display mode, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it. you will find a further description in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. if the connection is produced, a piglets appear. if this is the case, the filename and a symbol for file attachments are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer you may need the camera formations to any entry. with the page, properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog features file properties and the photo information that is saved internally from the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that for some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as the metadata page from the main window of & digival; or picture editing. please note that these metadata are not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The simplest way to download photos on their machine is the click on the button download and then download the selection from your camera into a single album.. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired options selected by & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download the chosen option. the button selected is extended until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option new download is available. these photos were still not marked by & digival; in this case the new images are marked with a star in the window display. if you choose this option, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you can download the buttons or download the chosen option, appears a dialog with which you can select the target album, in which the photos are stored, like normal folder, you can read in the section of my albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you chose the finish album, press OK, and & digicame; invites the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once, by selecting the button deleting, so you must first select them and delete it off.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way of extinguishing photos that you deleted from the camera. therefore, they are completely deleted if the photos were successful in a & digival; -Album were downloaded, before you want to delete them from the camera. if you do the camera hunt, you should do this about the cameramen, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often use as filenames for the photos often not especially meaningful names. the filename can normally load again after the photos from the camera was deleted. this can be useful to download the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and spider of the picture and for publication based description. if you use this last option, automatic folder is created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three additional options that are done before the photos are stored on the plate. the first two affect the data on the author in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the item & time for all loaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different format format as the standard format, you can use e.g. in the processing field the prefix Photo-% Y-% M-% d% H:% M:% S. place the option date & time add. for further adjustments you should read the help of the instruction.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option cam file, you have the option to change the filename in small letters. or in large letter, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digival, used for a photo is displayed below the name that displays the camera in the Preview. your settings for renaming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera screen.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digival; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time stage in order to complete automatic rotation during the shutdown. not all cameras are ready. in the sidebar metadata section, you can read more details about the information which your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched, and if your camera does not provide this information, the photo is in its original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic rotation, then use the button-width and select the automatic turn in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has made information about the date, where the photo was made available, can use & digival; this subverbs are based on image data. all pictures with the same date are available on the same subalbum. not all cameras are available this information. in the section sidebar Meta data you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>

<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from their host to her camera is the button download. then select the file dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files uploaded, you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>

<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. it is a position that is indicated in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be executed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with an accurate geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to mapping an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, police, and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you've forgotten later, where exactly the photo was made, you can open with a click on a browser which shows the area. if you want to locate a postcard to another & digival; user want to send the location of the photo, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to participate in the position of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data in the image? first, you should know that exiv2 get many GPS data fields such as, e.g., semi-trailers and maps. the question is actually more, how the data in these fields are. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via an processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for the geographical assignment (manual), and finally on the manual entry of famous places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera, which has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a couple that works with GPS receiver. either as the map or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS-interface: coyersEye Ipaq Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR ripe Pro G3</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading of GPS data from a device can be processed with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, this data is stored in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract data from images and from GPS, and be correlated. on the following page you can see the same under & Linux; OverpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudinal or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exiftool of Phil Harvey. it uses the signs of repatriates coordinates, for example of maps.codice.</seg>

<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG squeezing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this surgery does not reduce the image quality, since PNG need a fun-free algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can put this value on a high compression mode. thereby 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compressed, you can switch the deflate -compressor salaries for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, as the deflate -algorithm is working-free.</seg>

<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digians; picture editing only for photo concerned was for photos. currently, it is rapidly developing for a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The set-up is that all green pixels are identical. if the extender green pixel of the CCD-sensor should respond to sensitive to ultraviolet light. this option features a minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, eliminates but the 2x2 guitars with the VNG- or the AHD-quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white-colour of the camera is used. otherwise, if it is used, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white is not set in. standard is set to use a fixed color balance, which is provided on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the naming of the second sensors has the effect that subcutted images in four steps. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top-point, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the incapacity of your camera to look at the edge of your camera. the setting colors will produce some unusual results as they can reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the removable.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general is not as fast as green and red. & dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red proportions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much colour or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the option, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should be customized for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminate value to your taste. you probably have to set it a little higher than standard 1. this can also be made later in the options of & digival; -picture editing. to keep the time for the demoosaicing small, you should advance conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A humosaicing -algorithm is a digital image process, which stem from the colourful image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix colored pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color-construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& Dcraw provide you three alternatives available: bilingar, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. according to some tests it looks like AHD-Interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw. however, it makes color artefacts to the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with a acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-deviation of your lentils you can set the red and blue-proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a soiling edge, as you are performed during the pipe.</seg>

<seg id="316">The shade of paint views is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures colored not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit into the camera unit and model that you use. not all profiles are included in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which no colour-tone mapping or gammacupuncture. currently, dcraw gamma does not need to conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to carry out the tone mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft-proof profile which you can emulate about how your image would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your camera has a smaller color area as your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. you could manually correct, instead of leaving oneself to the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious that color profile is provided for them for what is provided. unfortunately, not in the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. this answer is naturally inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon ranges can detect the style for the goal: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>

<seg id="344">Virtually every action of the image processing can be undone or restored. the last action you can re-catchy if you want to work reverted or reinstated by selecting machining from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently you should remember the shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to catchy and Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; on the toolbar, you can press a moment longer, you get a context menu. if you select one of the menu, all actions in between also will be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the picture editing you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons, image high, image below or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes in the current photo, you are asked if you want to store them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can play in the photo and perform zooming in which you are Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar, or the entries in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a picture of the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: enlarging the size:</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come into the normal view where you use the Escape key. usually, then the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can revoke this in the introductory dialog of & digival; this lets you call out of the & digival; main window will display. see the section for setting the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can select the image file and receive the standard & kde; pressure dialog. you can adjust here the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print some pictures or entire sentences. entire picture pages may choose from your selection. you only need to select the images from the standard methods and select from the menu Album printing assistant. if you follow the assistant, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digival; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which represents important information and actions available for the selected images. the same page layout is available, even in picture editing. it is displayed when one of the five tab is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multifaches Click on the same rider lets the side bar appear or go back to the edge disappear.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the visual view you can insert complaint with unlimited size or insert. please note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are permitted in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut down after 2000 characters and special characters are being formed. if you want to use IPTC leafy box in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, you either use the button or simply switch to the next picture, the complaints will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to using-button there is one button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write metadata about the files you have selected always, if you have selected a metadata that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in souks and sorcerers. it can be applied either by a single mouse-click on the 5 stars onto the side bar or using the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the schematic in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keywords, and a box with the previously mentioned in this & digival; -meeting was reported.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords tree is adapted dynamically to the inappropriate keyword. you can limit the number of possibilities in searching for a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another step in entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by markings of the relevant applicant fields in the tree. all tags of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you can select a keyword in the sample tree, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the whole selection, if you want to provide a selection using a keyword, please read the section 'keywords.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side of the Deltfilter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, file, keyword and searchresults. if in addition, one or more keyword filter out of the right, will only appear in the cutters of these two. all keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop down. suppose you have selected multiple images to provide you with keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and then put on the selection. then a dialog, which you ask if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example shows the basic window pictures of a calendar day. the keywords is reduced to no keywords, which has reduced the amount to three pictures. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword was drawn from the right stuttering tree to the selection and sent there. a dialogue asks if the keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be displayed under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and have created and determine that it would be a or be, you can easily change it with a double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which in the database is sought. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can select a Advanced search of all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the cappzbox at the end of the rule and then use the knob. then you will see the options as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-designed workflow, the colours will vary from your camera or scanner. with a colourful workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner identical and that suit the colours you want, or on the web publish them from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme is coming to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons, they need for the results he wants. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about colour administration. in addition, you will find links with deeper information allow your own informed decisions to meet you with the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all of the criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They are working on a monitor based on the sRGB color foam. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenditure are per e-mail or the web, where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB worked so well and life for everybody is so easy, why should we use a different color space and thus have to make thoughts about colors?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the hugely-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB Farbraum, the thirsty region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensionale representation of sRGB with some larger farms, so visit Bruce Lindmere excellente page and click information and then click information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to be trusive my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB Farbraum?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB-colour area or not, you need to be trusive your monitor since sRGB, so that your; onitor is close to sRGB. therefore you have to monitor your monitor based on the sRGB standard, then you need to either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool presents five automatic corrections which can improve an image in most cases. use it therefore before you try to continue a further manual work.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, alternate, automatic, and contrast extend from the menu corrigible automatic correction, try automatically from your colours to make the best. you will be experimenting with these securities, to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the denial instead of the entire image, so the darkest point black and the brightest dot is as bright as possible without its color shaded. this feature is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Abed: this method regulates the luminescent of the selected picture, so that the histogram of the voicing unit is as flat as possible. sometimes the abnormalized results in enhancing the contrasts of a picture, sometimes it produces just trash. it is a very powerful operation that creates either miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic: this method maximizes the color-range in the red, green and blue-channel. they select the dark and bright border-tones and adjusting the red, green and blueberry to the complete Histogram.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast extend: this method enhances the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by the moving the lowest and highest values on the greatest possible area and a rejistaging of all values in between. this is only visible when rare images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white cover of & digival; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white straight of any photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-same correction is somewhat limited because over a color foam with 8-bit each colour is worked. if you can perform too far from the original image, with overexposure, which in 16-bit mode, your options for correction is better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salaries on copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it on the menu color white white off the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The showcase can be adapted to the size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically to the properties of the tool. if you want to see the original white straight, then you can click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the destination photos has a red marker. the Luminator of the Pixels under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histoction.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a Histogram is shown that dynamically is subject as soon as you change a parameter. this historiography is very helpful even, even in well illuminated images, most pixels very small Luminiscations. with one knob you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on the shadow, saturation and gamma-gamma. the shadow Justine lets you improve or down the shade of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Analogue with the above controls around, you should use the colour temperature pipette. press this button and then anywhere on the picture shows to use selected color to calculate the colour temperature of the white blazing. in this way the temperature and green -values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white off with the list of preference. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overtaking indikator increases the colours, when more than a color-channel of the Pixels is overexposed.. they will be shown the combined result in the whiteboard. this is displayed in the preview as a remodel indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Buttons are saving and load exactly this. each setting of the whiteboard can be put in a text file and later upload it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button-presets keeps all filming again on its standard values and the associated neutrals. keep in mind that neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save it, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust here the codiercises per color-channel of the operated picture. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high-quality images. this coding also requires more record, calculating time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and the assignment of color profesicles. colour-mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for the use of colates can be drawn to rate the chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool in the menu is available under colors of key correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you can always use the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction, you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">One very powerful opportunity to correct exposure solutions is the tool of the Gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digival; tool color effects puts you four color effects, a solar power-effect, a nevia filter, a neon-effect and a cantonal filter at your disposal.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar polarization was also called Sabatier, an effect of the first developed pressure replaced by the additional light. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were reversed by the second illumination. the result was a part-negatively negative of the picture. this tool allows you to make this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity checks the solar power. at approximately 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. an additional increase is finally a negative image, that so do not appear on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy seffed. the original image is the (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a saturation that makes it a stronger controversy effect that makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the flagship for one on the day light of the FUJIFILM. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated color with daylight and high contrasts. the characterization make him a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated color are also some picture graphists, specifically those who hardly see landscapes flourished, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates the contrast to the contrasts of the result. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlichts. with great pictures the filter can choose the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon that you want to correct the shade of your photos with the tools in the menu subject to colors. all your utilities can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reversed problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness will reduce it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if it please, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple Leuchement / contrast / Gamma is the tool key corrector to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool is very complicated, you need for the use of the slider. more concrete, the three sliders below the histogramms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of the Intensity values, a histograms, the active Canals or the selected enclosures. beneath the graphs are three slider into the inside and which can be delayed to change the Intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn to use is the Regulators to move and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side the original and preview of the image can be viewed dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this box-box can be set to whether the histograms with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis is frequently present. for pictures of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic entrance is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three shelves: the top one for the dark Tones, the middle for the bright sounds and the lower for the middle sounds, often called gammays.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three shades can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadow, middle and bright sounds automatically. in addition, there is a knob for fully automatic etting.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each field. there are also two shelves that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of output levels can e.g. create a hidden picture as a background while getting slightly different in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this knob the images are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and loading: with these buttons, the entries can be stored in the filesystem and later reloaded, the Gimp is used format.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three colour pipettes, the input values will automatically be readed for all shadows, medium and sun notes. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the extension of the original set of the histogramms for rot-, green, blue and aruminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overloading indikator controls all color-channels to find over-coated pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left the half of the original and the target image is displayed dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows the channel to specify the canal that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box, two symbols are found around between a linear and a logarithmic view. for paintings produced with a digital camera, the linear mode is most useful. for pictures with large sections of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beams. in this case the logarithmic mode is further.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move for example a cator to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds with darker extracts and that the image image becomes dark.</seg>
<seg id="436">The preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to change this markings on the area you want to change it will be a suitable line on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move on and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and loading: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each turn which you created can now be saved in filesystem and later be loaded. the file format for that is Gimp's curvy format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three colour chain buttons, you automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun notes. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the checkpoints for the red, green, blue and Luminanzkurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overloading indikator controls all color channels to display over-coated pixels. if available in more than one channel, you get the combined result. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo that has been fixed in Luminanzkanal. shadow and sun-notes was applied with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and correctened (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digival; picture editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or to change the shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another high-evolving tool to mix the shades of the images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel mixer of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the selection box you can select the color for the histograms: this gives you a first note like you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and failure. the leftist area of the window will show you a preview. the original can be regarded as compared to its own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the histogram to show you the corresponding shade.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: Regler for red, Green and Construction allow you to blend these channels. if you can also keep Luminous, since the channel mixer then becomes DAS tool to generate great black / white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-white portrait.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix Monochrome, manages the reduction of a color to a visible smokes which comes from color. color does not occur at the same place in the colour canals and whose sound pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the drain first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any number blender hiring you can save it for later and then load. the file format is channel-channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overloading indikator controls all color-channels to find over-coated pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue Channel has been redesigned. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is under (1) and to see the image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your level of abstraction. with the development of digital photographs, black / white, since paint images can be converted into the calculator. also with a set of clips.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulated a black / white filter coating with a green linens filter. this looks great, in all the scene images, and fits in particularly well with portraits of the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranges: simulated a black / white film coated with a orange strumfilter. this improves landscapes, maritime sceneries and air pictures. so much like the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangethter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulated a black / white filter coating with a red linens filter. this creates a dramatic decision-effects and can simulate moon-light on the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulated a black / white filter coating with a yellow Linsenfilter. this is the most natural color tone and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and middle sounds, while he adds a bit coldness in the shadow of a drupes and the recovery in a Sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to E5 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digival; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a colouring or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a screen, the bull of an old master, a pop style portrait out of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall. the mending image image of texture can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the semblance of depth and three-dimensionality of texture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper writer is applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and that changed under (2) to see. the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digival; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder into the limits of a picture is not an easy task. one possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative setting. this is a psychological barrier to the aspiring eye. under picture frames, the module can be started from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you create the desired amount of cream for your image. covered with a thin line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), Abdulet sheped it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a knock-effect and decorative insert a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: reduces the width of the frame in percent. the width is width from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the scope of decorative pieces will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio is important for the pressure of the images, especially if you used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in a picture of any place. this also goes to multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use textures, orientation, color out of color foam and drawing with its characteristics as you need. you'll just choose a frame around the text and / or a half-cautious background. already the image is ready.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text may change until you press to the button "OK. once the image has been stored once, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digival; tool content you can apply a template about an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The image image into image processing can be used to put on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the Stencil, there are no limitations on the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG format and should work with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of the file size; thus, you simply send an e-mail in English to the & digival; Mailinglist digival-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you have to set your plug-in-folder with the knob. please choose the folder in which you have to copy the documents. these settings will be marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder for the stencils being set, appears a determination which reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder updates the previews of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button is magnified the underlying picture. it is centered to the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse knob.</seg>
<seg id="476">Crushing: this knowled the underlying image. it is centered to the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the image to the whole image, you must decrease the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse knob.</seg>
<seg id="477">Moving this button to move the image below the image below. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then adjust automatically to the visuals.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; makes three different tools available for bowing. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpends. it is very fast and easy, but specially created in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharfe mask is working on the contrast of the edges to let a picture sharper look. actually, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dungeon and it really makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocussies is perhaps the best of the three, as it really improves the sleves. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without attention as well as most digitised images require a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the digitalization process colors with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras require normally more detrimental sharpening than regular cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images it is often applied for a camera of internal testing. on the contrary, pictures in the pipe-format will always be sharpened during the processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner apply a shareholder value already during the reading of the picture. if you activate this, you will get in control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you may need usable results by raise a photo with the pair of sharpenises. you can revoke the menstrup menu with the menstrup menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should deal with caution because the outcomes are not very natural: the toughness of edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the needed technique for sharpening a picture of choroidal hemosters. you can find more information about the menchorus of chorus-chorus. below refutches you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shooting.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it increases. use the tool to switch mark with the menu item corrigible and experimenting something with settings. the window display on the right of this dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the thumbnails will help edit the picture. the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. standard values often produce good results and should first try out. an increase in radius or amount reinforce the effect. if you make the insharpness mask, the noise and the impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is like many pixels in each side of a edge by the filter are affected. high resolution images allow larger radiadores. you should therefore break pictures of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wired image added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the use of difference. you can thus define a minimum difference to the edge of filters. in this way, these areas are avoided with a soft switch between the killing of the toughen and therefore beautifull flaw in faculty, desks and water-surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masculine filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). sharp shift was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digival; tool of Refocussies refilled a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected unfolding filters -algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries one image to & quot; refocussian quot; in which it makes a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. this is a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of Unsharpened Maske. Refocussies reached usually better results as blurred mask. you can launch it from the menu by calling colors refilled within the image.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular looms works far better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung eine produces a very long tail, which is far from the original sources. the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß'schen Faltung is influenced in most cases even very heavily from the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular wheels: this is the radius of circular loops. it is the key parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures should put the default value 1 good results. you can put a higher value when your image should be very blurred then but to Heiligenscheine.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reducing artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; remote and versatile. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpative effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Rauschfilter: an increase in the shaker can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1% is too low. however, the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will gradually faded the image further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche Schärfe: this is the case for the Gauß'sche Schärfe. use this parameter if your insharpness Gauß'sch. in most cases, you should leave this value on 0 to avoid annoying artifacts, so you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the rough filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die pattern: this value determines the size of the transformation dium. an increase in the die-size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular archipelago or the Gauß's Schärfe. however, however, that the module can be very slow if you choose great values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The storing als and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any of the refilled parameters you have set will be stored for later and can be loaded for later.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all cuts, color and voicing structures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much surgeries changes that are not immediately visible, but left later inconvenient artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you can read and compress, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred mask produces better results than sharpends. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as a sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking always has to produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of dissharpness. for the Wiener Filter s, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters are always at least as good as the Unsharfe mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better with the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color-image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of raising ecrestructure in digital paintings, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Regler Glätte sets the blurredness of the enquished in order to generate a natural wickedness.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tinte allows a adapted color for the pupset. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most highly developed tool to remove the desired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Incompatible algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets than starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filtering orders, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a even buzzled over the picture. whereas larger value leads mainly homogeneous regions, smoothed and details. a value of 0,9 should be anchored in detail. please note that the details are always referenced.</seg>
<seg id="520">Draft addiction Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothed evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is only in one direction. if you have a movie starters or CCD set-up will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best with a value close to 1 removes.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum humidity factor above all es. p then defines the relative humidity. place this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is expected, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: returns how often the algorithm is crossed. normally, here 1 or 2 is out.</seg>
<seg id="524">WinkelhoWide da [5, 90]: Angled integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small for a long run. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral Stride width [0,1, 10]: integral Stride width in pixels. you should put the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixels-smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More that you receive by selecting this option is only small. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow it to happen.</seg>
<seg id="527">Buttons are saving as a store and shop accurately. every setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and later be reloaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image error messages comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load for itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knobout.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image bug with baby Artefacts may be corrected. the module is made on a photo that in Guatemala city with an analog camera was made, as you see there is a peculiar black artifact pact in the foreground, that is caused by a bad film storage during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digival; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease image smokes. it uses an copyrighted algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool presents selectable image filter to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensory from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor drives, so you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene which has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain with the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is required for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can wired the image. the above radius moves about the image and the color in it becomes smooth and thus minor errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controlled the sharpened body. this value sets the point of the filter to the front to determine the sealing changes. if the value is increased, smoking cals can change. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and smaking or decorate it again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controlled the edge-precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it's too strong does not occur the entire rocket or smoke-wheads may occur. put it at a value near the maxim if you want to remove a waking or JPEG-artifacts without losing more details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controlled the luminance of the picture. we recommend that you either change the colour or luminance in order to improve a picture. these settings not affect the smoothing process controls through the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerances of the picture. we recommend that you either change colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the controlling process of the image.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamer intolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the dark areas, which are typically boosted to increase. it is dirty, however also the shadow spheres.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controlled the alignment of the phasenoid compound. this value defines how fast the adaptive fileradius occurs due to variations of the luminous density, if it is too high can occur a polluting. if he can occur to his minimum, splash and phema can occur and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Loading and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters are used for smoking reduction which you have set can be stored in filesystem and later be charged.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking reduction can change your life. the original image is associated with (1) and the corrective with (2) is applied with the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to increase. use this tool to draw the softmark with the menu item corrigible and experiment with the smoothing. the window display on the right side of the dialogue can see the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digival; photo restoration is definitely one of the most highly developed tools to decrease photographic record.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility of removing a lot of undesirable artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's rocket, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or detrimental images, which makes the content as well as the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and textual composition. the Texprocess correction is performed with another tool, the image error correction, the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannl and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a compression desperate jacket, he produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this attitude should correct these issues.</seg>
<seg id="549">Buttons are storing as and shop accurately. every setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with like-like rouches. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensation of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film gritt in the faces. the original image is under (1) and correctcorrections under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for the photo-restoration. this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the Scan Artefacts created by the scanning light and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digival; tool kit permits hot text of photos that with a CCD camera, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, who are protected by copyright Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are particularly high-quality raw-mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression to have an built-in oppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "this tool can be used to remove" "" "name Pixelquot; and" "" "SpPixelquot; and" "" "bright Pixelquot;" "". "there are currently no manuals method to select the bad pixels." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizards with the knock. the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you have to discover the dark picture directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the proper milk image to a corrective image. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note here that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and this automatically loads in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the thumbnails will help you correct the result within the image. the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are taken up in all areas of view.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels in the preview and results of the filters. then choose the best filter method to cross this pixel blocks. these are the available filter:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durbschnitt: it is designed to determine an average of the thieves. the resulting color will be allocated in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels with a distance from 1 of the pixel block will have drawn to the calculation of a bi-linearen surface (2-DIM) or a group of linear curves (1-DIM). these are then used to interpolish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to pixel block will be deducted to calculate a bi-quadratic surface (1-DIM) or a group of square metven (1-DIM), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a gap of 3 or less will be approached by a bi-cubic surface (2-DIM) or a group of Cuban curves (1-DIM), which is then used to interpolish the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hot-text correction to a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposing, applied. the original image has been enlarged by 300% (1) and corrected photo is below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiate; Vignetetics is a tool to correct the vigof, that is, subordinate corners, one image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Vastness lenses, in particular those in middle and large photo format, can often be illuminated the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture; in fact, the light can reduce the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many centre filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. Within objective, also with center-filters, an opening of f / 16 or less use, because otherwise unsharpaging effects arise by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the major exposure areas of today's filmstrip and film-scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by using an equivalence transformation triggered by a centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting of the vigour and with three other regulators, you can control the objective of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the level of light extraction at the point of the largest density the filter. the standard density is 2,0, resulting of an optical filter with a blending attitude of 1, or by chance to compensate with a greater degree of vignet, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukickness, contrabast and gamma-orders: the beating of an image with the vigour of the pixels. you need to reuse the exposing of the target with these options. the regulator must provide you only positive values because you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re-readjusting of the wayside of the target, then let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the Gradation from the & digival; picture editing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting-correction to an image. the original image (1) indicates the reflecting in the corners and (2) the corrective image. a luminous and contrast correction is also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digival was a tool to fix the effect of spherical lentils on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colored distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or counter-witch shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third wheel has a similar roundtrip effect, flat but to edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The Koefficient fourth Grades corrected the remote corners, opposite to the second grades. if you combine these two can be eliminated any geometric carts nearly eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second grades. with negative values can be corrected and positive values of conscientious objection.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth grades. this value appears stronger in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corners parameters changed the sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value added the image size new and thereby performs a correction of the first grades through. negative values scale while positive the image diminished.</seg>
<seg id="583">Clear: this value constrained the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filtering orders, illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distortion-evaluation. the values that you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonn- or pinion correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes. best carry out this correction as every first through. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonnellular correction, the effect is obvious to the False.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction is provided that this tool provides a vertical and horizontal support line. move it to an important place, such as the marine edge or a building wall, inside your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines on this point. afterwards, you can fix the tonn- / conscientious objection with the help of lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">When you correct a conscientious objection, the resulting image black corners. you can transform them with the cutting tools in the menu using the image processing or using the Zoom regulator of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tonnellular correction is made of. the next logical step for some motives, e.g. photographs from the front, frames and paintings, it is the perspective that all angles in the image 90 degrees. note this when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of a tonnellular correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and corrected image below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating Infrarotfilm of the GimpGuru.org Website that is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensor range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you look at the red rectangle with the mouse you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters, filing and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option add to the fine texture of a high-sensitive film. the ISO controller changes the amount of the grains and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows will be white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter colour can be managed to reproduce Infrastructure film, especially the Grünkanal does not make sense the effect on black / white photos, as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared-filters is applied to a landscaping photo from New Zealand. the original image is placed under (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was put to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the shrews.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digival; filter filing is a simple to use the tool to reproduce fine grains on your images such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, combining the manufacturer great silver-grains of the photo material.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film phenomenon consists of your photo a certain mood, or seems to move back into the past. that the picture gets a timeless atmosphere dissolved from daily life. if you want this particular, gallery-like, grained picture, granular sight, so you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be adjusted to control the intensity and granularity of the Körner calibrated. the default value is, although higher values need to be required, to ISO-2400. if you need more Körner, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film camera screen based on a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity correspond to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digival; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiata, filter oil painting, gives your digital pictures a nice appearance as an oil painting. nature pictures and style live are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two shelves to influence this effect. the above chooses the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large pictures. smooth relies the gaps, or, seen from the other side, the sleepiness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the edited is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and glasses 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digival; filter coal drawing is used in color and intensities to generate a coal output. therefore, pictures whose gradient are slowly changing and therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you'd chosen to outline, which scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two shelves with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the above Regler chooses the foundation size and the lower adjusting the contrast (glass).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal-pass filter. the original image (1) and the changing picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by changing the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digival; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it is stamped in wax. it uses an copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digival; filter graving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important on the content. the filter makes the differences between color and intensity, to transform the image into a grey, mondarily landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows the contrast of filters to set. a value of 30, corresponds 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and processed image (2). the depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distorted effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: shares the image in cells and let it look like if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft 2: analogue to the Wave blocks 1 will distorts the image here in a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the knock.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by Unsharfe Effects. it uses copyright protected algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unpness: caught the image along the slayer lines going out by a center. this simulates the unsharpness a zoomend camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of many times in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial dissharpness: blurring the image through rotation of the pixels by a center. this simulates the toughness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal capacity: comparing the image to produce the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion for movement: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the insharpness of a linear movements, z: B: off a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Smoother stretcher: blurring the image soft to the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this is made with a dreamy and shiny soft focus (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle glaring.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shock-sharpness: comparably the image through the random shift of the pixels and simulates the insharpness of an arbitrary camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Smart gripe: finds the color basins in the picture and caught it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangle cells and then created it, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="624">The shelves are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image. this gives it natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the trop. as the comfort size doesn't grow automatically with the size of the picture, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and the density of drops. Fischaugen changes the optical effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can head with the & digival; picture editing a range free from shelves. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face, which should be free to choose. if you exit the filter rain drops, the area will remain free of rain drops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the umbrella term. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it by Spiegs or turning into the right orientation. the tools can also be transformed into the menu and transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles definitely is one of the most highly developed tools to grow a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">One picture to waste is simple. the big question is how you can get an image bubbles and the details fail? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here is a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change the size uses a linear Interpolation method to adjust the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation to enlarge an image. & digival; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say to the tool like you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the new size ratio is maintained with the input of the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is expected, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons can be used as a text file, which can be used as text file and later be loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo bubbles is very fast at what it makes, but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load for itself. you can cancel calculation at any time with the knock.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by wires a small color-picture on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). preview (2) is the result of linear standard enhancement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a often underestimated tool to create an image. the picture editing allows you to simply cut a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle, create. you will see this rectangle then while you're moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you leave the mouse again the area of the photo is cut off, the area of the photo is cut off. you can change the size of the area by changing at the corners of the rectangle. you can create a new rectangle by simply drag it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the incision, use the button bar button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file storing or the storing file under the menu file to save the scratch photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the hallways you can change the size of the rectangle by changing the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, that you have defined in a dialogue will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool aging ratio, you can specify the orientation as a high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross-format is assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool to make aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. that means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you are centimeters, inch or some other physical size. for example, you can see a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and the aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, there are two buttons for selecting automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in dialog you can set with the Max. ratio button to the section for cutting on the maximum possible, depending on the chosen relation and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool By side-ratio saves the settings depending on the orientation-orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the fitting tool for the next time, those settings are stored as standard values depending on the orientation. the modified image measurements are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data retrieves the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembling aid enable them to help you put your pictures better together. these aid are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious submissions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-thirds, harmonic triangles are the possibility of a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles oriented towards the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden centre is a division that is based on various natural growth pattern, such as the coil of a Nautilus Muschel or the flowering of a sun blume. it emerges in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden split is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have assembled the golden division in all times when you put your paintings, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from where any number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. one composition that is usually follows as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre makes liquid-lines available if you put an image. these aid are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring your goal to achieve good results for your photos. in comparison to the Third Party, the golden spiral generates a liquid place that can follow through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a balanced visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is called the rectangle of the golden Spirale, also called golden rectangle. there should be something that the eye can be at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles is also guided by the top of the golden Spirale. please note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonale can put into these lines can have a static building dynamical appeared.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use the triangle to break up your frame, you create an effect of placing professional photographers dynamic Symmetry. try to put your image focal on one of the intersections and other visual information in the trinity. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal reflect and Vertical patterns can be used to mirror the harmonic particles.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the knob, you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture of many colours and a high contrast, the Help lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture to turn any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it's easy to adjust the camera not exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates an image in which the things turned around a angles. you can fix this with the & digival; picture editing and tool-free rotation. you can also transform your rotation, and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the fever angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button presets you can put the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To help your help, the module is Free Rotation a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse-cursor to position the two lines. after you set it on a left mouse button. now adjust the angle just as described in previous sections.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have filmed a picture you will find unwanted rings in the corners. one way to fix this is to transform the function transform it to make use of the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is Automatic. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option anti-aliasing put the image a bit after the rotation. however, consider the obliteral warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All prospective transformations are conducted by a fixed point in the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red quadruts at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically calculated. on the right of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including clean areas which have been created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including clean areas which have been created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle on degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the top: displays the current angle on degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle on degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the bottom: shows the current angle on degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjustment of perspective the image becomes a little bit dirty. for an individual adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments generate an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you paired the perspective, you get unfree three-sided holes in the corners. one way to deprive this is the picture with transforming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool system is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is converted into a parallelogram. you can transform this module over transform.</seg>
<seg id="679">Configure your image by using the horizontals angle and the vertical angle. you can press horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press preference to zero, the angle on zero will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target are displayed right from the preview.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your assistance will end a vertical and horizontal line. move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the activation tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After which you have carried out the shear, the image becomes a bit dumb. for a single shift, this effect is mostly negligible, but two cases are consumed at twice as much urring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shift, the picture has an unbeautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transforming from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digival; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were complied with. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digival;</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site. however, they will always present JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digival; shows only files in formats on the familiar list. this happens with the file extension and a comparison of those using a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list. you can change this list of file rements. you can generally change the list of file rements; can be found in the section configuration for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Virtually all digital cameras stored photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format used. a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digival; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression analysis to digital pictures. thereby redundant information is reduced, in order to save the image data on an efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results as JPEG for the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the pipe format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can read raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the pipe converter of & digival; in section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with & digival;.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to geographic areas geographically in the spherical system, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitudinal and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To feature your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert data for you from your GPS equipment.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Choose the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to load a possible correlation about time and localization by you, you have to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains of course data the short time at the same places were included, as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file loaded a automatic correlation that shows the coordinates in red. GPS Track data is recorded in GMT-time and therefore it must be calculated with the time zone. this can be done with time zone. place your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation gives a high deviation for the GPS time and camereit. is the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have a trace data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the pictures. the difference of 2000 seconds then will correlate all pictures in this field.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have a suitable data. if you know that in reality a locating difference between camera and GPS is, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to the interpolishing.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set with this dialog manually. this is useful when you have a number of photos at the same place. as the dialog provides the coordinates from one call to the next notice you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The localization can also be found and set accordingly. choose the relevant region and enlarge you sie.Leadership to have achieved this again and again, the height must always be selected manually. the card can be switched between card, satellite images and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data on the images. here is a small script used to accommodate a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can choose the albums that can be exported as HTML pages. the charset will be UTF-8 coded to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab allows to select all the albums created according to HTML. you need to select these albums. the albums are not hierarchically displayed. with the three buttons on your right you can quickly appear a large number of albums. in this area, the Albenschau and the text of the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image is created a page where the image is displayed. if you then click on a picture, the image is displayed directly with your standard view, & eg; Cuckshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings when and how the gallery will be stored with all your corresponding pictures. to do this, choose one folder on which you have writing your permission. a sub-folder containing the name KIPIHTMLFile, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF data of your original images are also stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other colouring depth, you can change the standard color. which naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are explicable.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab listing allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the pictures, these are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window indicates the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages the window will not automatically be closed. therefore, you can see the programme messages, in order to determine if bugs occurred during the generation. the web browser is automatically displayed in order to view the gallery preview. press closing around the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Bildbetrachter is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture above allows him to view a selection of images and execute on them base operations such as shooting, zooming or push. the observer is absent with short images and folders. it was developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed as standard in the full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG-free module is a tool to change images without any of your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in the JPEG format, images in the JPEG format, without the usual losses in quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the losure storage is it that the file size increases, since no compression of the color-information is held. this can be found e.g. at the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that you can combine your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. Author: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailingliste-de-Imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import and function of the metadata moduls you can copy data from one image to another. then select the file dialog with which you can copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all educational formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not to write any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG kodierer can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, using a defined length, to convert. this module makes use of packages Mjpegtools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV der Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can choose a background color for the slideshow. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the media, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG-aschau. afterwards, you can set up the extras MPEG-aschau set up the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are put on image files in the portfolio. you can also change the sorting of images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">Once you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to select the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely be the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds which is shown in seconds. the speed of the picture above will be specified below. a lower value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave them black. the name and the path of the created file you can set among the name of the MPEG-output file. therefore, you can reserve the extension mpg possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you provide an audio file under name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after you can adjust all settings to your wishes, you can catch a cup of coffee with the button. depending on the speed of your computer you can enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the diaschau if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that body scanner or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the Mjpegtools and ImageMagick packages on the button below right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer driver allows you to print multiple images on a piece of paper together in standard print sizes. the combined images can also automatically print with the image editing. this is e.g: sensible to improve your or with the Gimp module to direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import your in the raw-format stored images in one of three formats, JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the Command Procraw instrument dcraw by Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: expect the same results as the software from your comrades. sometimes get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted, and start the module. the Raw-image converter window appears in mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can see the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now reuse the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether camera orders for the white can be used. the key parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour controller can be selected so you can use the contracted information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switches has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the release result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file formats.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the losure LZH compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you prefer to process your images frequently or you'll later continue using the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you want to select JPEG as storage format the metadata present in the RAW-file are stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings you can start with the exit button. if you want to cancel the process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The forklifts mechanism allows you to convert different images to once. use this mode once you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically resign the existing file. however, a preview is not available. however, a preview is not available at how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compressed all images in one album. it also uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming of all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the Startular and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it is used to convert the first program from the ImageMagick package. you can enlarge or enlarge the image. four types of change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size changes in a dimension. the width or height of the image gets automatically, depending on the picture-orientation, selected. aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): compare size in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for e.g. to adjust your image to screen.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate scale changing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed on this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepare the image for the photographic press. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photoppers. the target image, including background size, random size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of your printed images in advance. additional pictures can be drawn on the list of the coming pictures and show it there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After having started the module, the image window will display images from you with the selected images. you can add additional pictures to the selected images. for the most recently displayed image, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and insert it there to add it to the images below.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the knob images the selected images will be removed from the list of the coming pictures.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all images, you can open the new message window to your e-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject directly here. the pictures selected by you are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures to once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of emails. there may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and every time is used till you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you need to install the Gmail agent on your computer previously. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are put together into a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photographs, but it is best adapted to the losure products such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG when you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you to JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you want to select the file format and the original files in the JPEG format, the original Exifs are added to the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status types, in search of errors, see. your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button Connect, you can shove this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced diaschau a window will be displayed with questions like your slideshow. you can choose between the images selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL overapproaches in the presentation will be activated very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding Graphikmap, as otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option will show that the filename of the images in the lower left corner will be shown during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option tyards ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endlosed loop. you can then manually Cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose that the images are shown in an accidental order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between the pictures can be set the timeless gap between the individual images. 1500 seconds of milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should let them start your friends with your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, the transition between images does not choose another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move your mouse into this corner to switch off.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, and stop the preceding and the next picture and stop the diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left side of the screen you can see the current file stream, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date right now has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. Author: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module backpicture is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module contains the currently selected image, depending on the select option of the submenu, as the background for your KDE labels.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have made your pictures and videos with notes, you can see with & photo sites, see the picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in individuals, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look at EXIF-based information that view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current subpictures. in the following, each one described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changed. see picture below.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select a further person only the images are displayed, where both individuals are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can display with preview images to view the images of your application area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol before their name. they can store up with & kphotographer, but of course for each person to store their own image, this also applies to places, keywords, and other categories that you define themselves. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button which you want to use on the toolbar. in the seeming context menu, you can select which view you can have for the current category. please note that you can display e.g. symbols with images from people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no appropriate images).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must define ourselves which image should be displayed for each individual person. to view this, you have to select the image editor, as shown in the picture. here you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the picture factor to your liking and thereby choose which part of the picture is to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you open the entry window in the main window, a dialogue will be shown that is very similar to dialogue for fixing the image properties.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a sequence in the fields of appropriation or description, the complaint or descriptions of the images are searched according to this text. if you want, you can also be able to insert a date after which, for example 1971, or the entire date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window you can browse all images by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, however not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the Uhandbook for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try different functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kangalbum; and have a look at the freeway, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotographs, and select in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & kangalbum; for the first time, or select in the menu Help menu of the photo album; start the demo. finally, some example will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotographalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kangalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kangalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar watch here:. as the name suggests, this bar will show you datasheets statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different schedules. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by showing cuts only 10-minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline allows you to use the following ways interactively: you can view the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date displayed in the preview is displayed) and also the timeline indicates the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline, drag the mouse button and select the mouse over the ruler of the timeline so that you choose to select an area, you are shown in the view view only pictures of this period. you can abort the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; introduces you two options to create HTML websites with your images. one is available in & kangalbum; the next part of the user's manual is published in & kphotographalbum; integrated version, which you can create via the HTML file...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more exactly.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later. click on kfotalbum; HTML-example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created to see the overview page. nails information on export data can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information will be displayed on the HTML pages. therefore, you can avoid that information is displayed at the viewer's viewer. for example, all pictures of a party are displayed. note that & kphotographalbum, currently all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images prior to certain considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are clear, why not specifically noted.</seg>
<seg id="923">Bottom of the page you can view different solutions for the pictures. therefore those you have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no images can download for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time. so, you can change your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, as if he wants to display a picture larger it switches to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folder and the URL where your website will be stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best choice for all your HTML files will be selected for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and the next time automatically adds. you can either select a folder or a KDE Support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check whether this really will be visible for viewers. if you have created for the basic folder a URL will start a web browser after the pages have been created, then this folder should be. otherwise the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you do not have to copy them manually. so that the import function, see, correctly, you will need to specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base-folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The exactly described settings are covered all three on basic sub-folders and URLs found. in these, a subfolder will set the name of which you can specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking for a family-party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kangalbum; you may, of course, you may have spent a lot of time for viewing the images. if you have a lot of time for it, you may have to write songs, people on images, recording, etc. then do not need to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file, whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether the images can be saved into the file and that you can share all pictures of the file. the obvious drawback is however the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the images in doubt. first, the images found in the folder of .kim file. the corresponding pictures are not found, so the images of the URL you have indicated when creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file by using HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog to export pictures, you can export over the menu file... call.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it should be internal or external .kim files, the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the option Manuell inside the .kim file, you have to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatisch to the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures are automatically copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip-files. as most images are already very small with JPEG compressed and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you like this, you just choose the option of export file compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this site is arbitrary size size. if you want to send your friends pictures, the images might not be in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can restrict the size, for example, that each image should be a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu of Importers... select, will import and import database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to Importing is made up of four steps. first, you need to select which pictures you want to import, according to which folder the import should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category people who are going to import file personer (if you're a Dane), while this category is called for your database people, which are to be imported into the third dialog windows and which categories are imported into your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to import the categories of the importing file with the categories of your current database. an example for this can be seen on the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and look at: if you look at images, one often would like to view images of your Italy vacations and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all images on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will examine the different steps away (1) determination of the information about your images, via (2) the search and prestige, up to (3) advanced issues and adaptation options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program for the Manage of your pictures. but it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. many places in this manual is spoken about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all of its information in the file index.xml to the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup using a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, coping on a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your images are stored and uses these for future starts. if you want to find another database tree with images, you can launch a different folder database; with the option -c. as an example: kphotographer album -c ~ / company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry Settings Settings; set up to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotographer. in the following section of the user manual, the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">Links you can see six different symbols that you can call for setting options for viewing and options for viewing the viewers. for each setting a detailed help is available which you can call on the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In was described you as you can set for each picture different properties, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, that is used to detect already existing groups. for each available group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories are already mentioned in the dialog options. in dialog options you can set complete membership groups, i.e., for example, all the members of a group set up in a group instead of explained all groups of a coglie as in.</seg>
<seg id="956">When you see the settings that are available to the solid of the member groups. with the above listed list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, there is a list of the current category and in the right one list of categoria categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum, shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digival and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface. approximate information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called on the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules possess a help page which you can call on the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications with each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; demo data base can always be testing out using the demo database, before you retrieve them via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the menu help. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules via KIPI are very different, thereby providing it may be that some modules with & kphotographer works; not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also includes KIPI, is that the other applications are not supported by their images in albums: this type of order does not support, simulated it for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotographer.</seg>
<seg id="962">Doing the current album, the current album, that simply matches the current view, so all images that shows you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here & kangalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kangalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you used in the introductory dialog as a category for virtual albums, for example, if you want to use the category people, will then do so, so if you choose to view persons and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Because some modules with & kangalbum; not compatible can you remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog, and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you can see an example of a first screen, as soon as you start & kangalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are familiar with from every other KDE app, you'll see the window with which you can browse your image database. at the moment, there is not a lot of information, since you do not yet have a lot of information about your pictures. in the section, we will look at this window but then click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kangalbum; is the ability to see each image with notes, where the image is recorded, you can put on each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for search and browsing, as you can read in paragraph, if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view you can see three lists with a text box by setting up persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the moving image of images within the list: if you have an family-party, and on all 50 images are shown the same 5-10 people, you can so that the names used to move upstairs are to locate the persons more quickly and classify them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to display an alphabetical list, click on the symbol for sorting the date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and put these pictures with notes. in this case simply click on the buttons, which are listed under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can more convenient all of these pictures to mark and select the menu item add additional items to once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a transgroup. to show you that it is a transgroup, a special symbol is shown.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the clue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new translation or subcategory. in addition, you can also select an entry in a category and specify, in order to sort them one subcategory of this entry. attention, that is presupposes that you just think your categories can be alphabetically. see for it.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the strange dialogs, by setting the bar that form the upper edge of the frame, click and moving. you can also make your own window by setting it outside of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button below... which gives you the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also complete a frame fully. if you want to see this window later on, use the button below... and then window a / off. this process will see you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will receive an overview with preview of the currently selected images, or any images if you have no filter here. you can configure the size of the thumbs, by simply shifting your mouse with the middle mouse button, configure it easy.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture in the background of your desktop, this image is set as a wallpaper for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it is displayed in the photo viewer. if you still don't have a window with a photo concerned, a new display pad will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images from the image below. simply select the appropriate images you wish to delete, or select either the Delete button or select the menu option. now you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum, which offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use the images stored anywhere without you having stored on the hard disk. of course, you have to record the images anywhere so you are in the database index. in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. this is e.g. at the pictures 1-9. however, for the pictures 5-9 however, the preview images exist, so do not view the preview of these pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the image.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires that you want to copy files from the folders and then copy them again. if you do not want to avoid the editing of your images, then please buy a larger disk in order to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you can find a submenu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy please filter the images so that you can see for others inaccessible and click on Current marine privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that may see your little sister, contexers and the menu item everything except for current view.</seg>

<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. for example, all images on the index.xml can access, read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only to those who are working with & kangalbum; they are not very familiar with the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you can manage all of your pictures with & kangalbum; manage and spend hours over hours, of course you'll want to look at some point. for this reason has a picture _ and video concerned. you can preview this from the preview as described in.</seg>

<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images on a printer in order to get the images on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above there is the viewer the opportunity to accommodate images with features, while you look at them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you press the corresponding letters. in view you see an image where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set the features on your images, these are available in the browser. you can then select all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use one module to copy the pictures selected on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you view out categories in dre view, then you can add characteristics to the pictures simply by pressing the letter for the characteristic after the picture was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, it allows you to paint a photo album; on the picture to paint.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted is not stored with the image, but in the database. in the way you can turn your painted later on.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In addition, you can see an image in the painted area. to switch the painting mode of & kangalbum; choose the image from the context menu. to end the Malen, you simply put the cross at the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">In order to work with & kpovmodeler, you must not fully control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation about & Povray; should you not read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then its properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire modelling section.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, as all subobjects already are selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar, or select the menu item in the menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1016">Is there several potential positions the following folding menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Use the menu either from the menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove previously selected items from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">When you have altered attributes, click on it to apply these changes. if you have invalid values, a message with a error description will be displayed. then you can edit the input content and then click on the changes using aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; logging in the dialog dialog, you can call the & Povray; a reference to the indicated object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user guide to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user's guide.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the publishing view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the company's own view and a small example of the scene is illustrated with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture would have chosen, even if you want just a part of texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot displays the points of the camera. you can pull these control points with the mouse button and therefore change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and it is displayed a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marked the center for scaling and rotation. you can change the shifting of pulling with the mouse inside the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has an output model. you can specify this value relatively to the visual material of the higher level or as absolute value. objects will only appear if they are selected or their visualization stage smaller or the same in the toolbar of the scene of the scene is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window marketing as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the default traits, or if you need a different arrangement, you can also adjust it to any other configuration. you can also save several platforms and simply switch between different regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a view view, drag the beginning water to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is laid down at the right or left side of that view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you wish to relocate several views subordinate each other, drag the beginning into another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the cardboard box at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window buttons are hovering views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view off the ankment, drag the beginning to the desktop, or click on the small to the left top line arrow in the log bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the log bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view you find entries for any type of views. new views are hovering, you can anchored them in any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window display can save you with view buttons... stored it. it becomes a dialog displayed in which you can save the window-log under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can rendering it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; this program was written correctly. as this manual was written, it was written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To rendering the current scene, click on the icon Rendering the icon Rendering in the toolbar, or select the menu pattern see scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">An Render-mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; it controls the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of Render modes, from a quick Preview to full-quality classification.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the toolbar icon at the toolbar, or select the Render Modi menu, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can type any name, however, sense is a name that can detect the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size, you can enter the width and height of the detainable image. if you only want to rendering the width and height of the image, select the cross-box subsection and enter the picture section to renovations into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combative field quality you can choose the properties, the & Povray; for rendering you use. this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diffuser reflexion lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user manual at & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is illustrated with only one beam per pixels, these images often have a moirs pattern or fawn effects in curves and lines, sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixels. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures can look better with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, applies and links & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adapted... the second method is adaptive-recursive, recursive because each pixel is still further divided into, and adaptive because the record highs depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">When you choose the first method of setting up POV-Ray 1 Strahl, then both pixels by tracking a certain additional number of pixel with super-sampling will be processed. if you adjust the repository value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a repository value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels will be calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixels. if the difference between the paint used the pre-deserted threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 subpixel, which will be individually pursued and checked on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the record can be prepared with the repository.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of smokes for the beam process, called Jittering. when you switch Jittering orders, changes & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; which diffuses diffuse of light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map board, you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixels is then transparent, if the associated beams did not have an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; if & Povray; it is not expected, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; select the menu-order file import... and select a file in the dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler is not yet the complete command of & Povray;. when assassing error messages or warnings, a dialogue window indicates a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support code text in & kpovmodeler, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can move objects from the object tree in the editor to export the source code for & Povray; to import objects in the scene, just highlight the code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called, if & kpovmodeler is rendering a scene. usually, this Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the assistance in the dead view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user Documentation to the displayed object. place here the path to your documents and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example) in the paths to the & Povray; -libraries. if you include files not in the folder of the scene, you also have to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in several paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the viewbox in the camera view and in the window-type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object set of points to the Raster in the context menu of the wire model. you can adjust here the switch separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values provide an accurate wired model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects like the beers you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross the High Detailed view for enhanced projections, all the wires model are further divided, when the camera used an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this property includes a better approach for projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is built. the wall is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you examine the ground, a floor is located below the objects. the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you activate the cafeteria, the non-recursive antialiased method used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling value can be set. more precise information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing leaps or create new window channels. in the section logo, you will explain how to create and store leartments.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Commodynamic Standard system Regulations: displays all existing buttons. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected terminations at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The presence outlined below lists all existing pane channels. a new arrangement can be created with the button Add and selected a selected order with the button deletion.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below shows all the views of the selected window order. new views can be created with the button Add and selected views with the button deletion.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with a new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with lockers, you receive a map view along the present window, with map view, and swells the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have straight & Povray; and now you want to start with no more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should make the ultimate but easy scene, at initial very popular: a bullet at one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you as a result you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should remember these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set the camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert a light of light, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all error-free installed, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; following preset window buttons:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols from the toolbar. please read the documentation, so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and icons right now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu recap punctually and then you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wired model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene that you create. in particular, you notice it in the fourth wiremodel view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderer.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if they click on it, see the contents of the view object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's guide to & Povray; find out more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is later reserved, but note that the camera in view has control points, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a KonTrollPunkt and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the button or press the input paste, the wire model views and the object tree immediately changes according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a creader (inserting body Quader) and size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an comprehensibility method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers actually an easy way. you can use an unendable level as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button. in the object tree the new name will appear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wired model view now indicates the layer now, although at the moment only as limited endpoint level. if you rendering the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree accurately, you will notice that you click on the icon + before the object. in this case, you'll see the different parameters for each new object: scale, rotation, and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should postpone the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just so you get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Select only the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog, in which you can select how the object is inserted. please select the name in the property tree. you can change the name in the property's view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks right now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment shows only one Mattes of black material because you can still have settings for the pigment. do not always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, there are many possibilities, but you now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not view any color on the header and ball, then click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now right now. if you are rendering your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you are required. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you have to list two new attributes, called One-coloured. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Select the object tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to run as you should understand the fundamental working method of & kpovmodeler. it can easily be understood just as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. Set the value for radius: to 1 (do not forget the input paste or the button) so that the ball has float outside the ground as you have shifted the bullet around a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering gives now an awful result: as previously to see, the surface looks like a Mattes black material. put in the following step an appropriate material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the bullet, you can now assign up a material now. as already at the floor, let the ball be a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select Erstes subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select Settings and set the values as below:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following photos and click on it, or press the input paste.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflexion already result in partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces, even if metal: still not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a Render method to generate a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you render a scene raytracer, the renderer shall be derived from the perspective of the observer (i.e. from the camera that outlines the visuals) by each pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this beam are calculated by the objects and how atmospheric effects like for instance fog. so, the scene pixel for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you'll see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye on which you look at the scene. without a light source you see also nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene that is to be explored, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted in this submenu and will replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model it is stored under the same name. it is a new file, you need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Displays the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the latest storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only select only if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeated the most recently made command. this menu item you can only select if you have used backups.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog, enter a name for a new arrangement, entering an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcuts and standard behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the shortcut. you can merge with this option preset short for & kpovmodeler; commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove the icons for & kpovmodeler and commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump map is a way to smoky smoking, without any bump on the surface individually modelling and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary that use the same file both for a Bump map as well as for texture.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes you can use as construction blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic body. these models are then processed to give them a realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixels-based base, by applying a image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">For example; it is a Comfortable editor and browsers. the application has a browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">You can either be displayed in an own window in the size of the picture or in the full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the browser will list files that you can show with clicking the & LMBs; or the key return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can indicate whether any image should be displayed in an own window, or whether all images are to be used in the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply tap the first characters of the file in the browser window. then a small input field was found in the lower right corner. if a suitable filename was found, the file is highlighted. you can leave the textfield by pressures of return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Set up - & kuickshow; there are five map cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; set in the two others, short commands, and short-commands for the browser, can set the shortcuts for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">This is selected, then the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest is filled with the background color with the background color, which you can further down. preset is not a full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point activated, downloads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder, while you still have the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option store & kuickshow; when ending the name of the most recently opened folders. at the next start opens a drive round; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click the colored beams to choose a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in the window mode, the window is larger than the picture, is also filled in the background with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can create & kuickshow; establish that only some of the file types can be displayed, which the program can be present.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option for large images the display pad is increased to the full screen. this option is switched as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determine whether the slideshow with the first image is to start in the folder or with the selected picture.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time period between the image changes in one slideshow. to change the value, you can input a new value into the input field or use the sliders and the small arrows right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions is set to 0, the slideshow is repeated until it is broken down by the user. to change the value, you can insert a new value into the input field or the small arrows right next to the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change here the shortcuts for the different modes of operating modes: in the map-maps, short-load and short-commands for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option you can switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolder and a window for the files) and the one-part view of the filesystem with folders and files in a window.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays large symbols for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short-order presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">Shows small symbols for the files in the folder. this display is only available in the short-order presentation.</seg>

<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can communicate with Amarook and Amarook. the simplest way is the use of the command dcop; which every KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts includes the executing from external programs and commands. usually, the function exec () is used. in this way dcop &gt; relatively easily be called. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarook; send notifications to all ongoing scripts. for this reason, scripts have continuously monitored their default file and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>

<seg id="1196">Amarok's script can also install script packages that can be downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.tary), which can be optional also with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend a archive name such as example script.

<seg id="1464">Opens the dialog dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is it? - Help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear with an active data disk / DVD or video DVD project. it is useful when you put files from a previous session to import the current project. this is useful when you are filming files for a multi-professional session. it is useful when this function is not used for you so that you can see the files and folders using existing files.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear with an active data disk / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & K3b; to import files from the current project. all other files are recorded in the project. this function does not remove files from the medium, it only finishes the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD copying dialog. this also allows without a project copy the copying a CD into another medium. alternatively, you can also just create a picture of a CD which you can then burn sometime later. also, there is also the possibility of the classy instead of normal copying. you should prefer clone if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD Copy dialog. this also allows without a project copy the copying a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also just create a picture of a DVD containing the help of copying dialogue. besides, there is also the possibility of buying a DVD with the help of copying dialogue, therefore the target medium must be big enough to accommodate the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the whole content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to formatting a DVD. with this dialog, you can formulate a DVD ± R (W) which enables the content completely deleted. & K3b; leaves you a choice between the writing modelling and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Crns a previously generated CD image. the dialog asks you to a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .ng files are currently not supported, therefore you must use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Crates a previously generated DVD-image. the dialog asks you to a * .iso -file as a data source, which can then be burned by loopholes of the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A DVD-video can be converted into a dialog windows. this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view, but can also be used freely. it contains information about the envisioning video, codifications, and even possibilities for changing the size and for cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the embedded medium details. this information is displayed in the table view and contain properties of the medium, such as size and title-length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbar of & K3b;. if an entry is scored, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Folding the folder view, or out. the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the table view is activated, their content is displayed in the table view. CD / DVD drives, also have a contextmenu with features such as media Info, Lock and Dislock the milf or expose of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Let the ingredients select a or out. the ingredients allows the selection and drag files into the project perspectives. the ingredients is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Folding the scalp in the project view, or out. the scalp is a narrow area that is only visible when the project perspectives open open projects. the scalp has no real function; it looks pretty and separating the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens up a dialogue window to change the keyboards for & K3b; after having selected one of the commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyorder to it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; setup assistant. with this you can adjust the correct entitlements to the burning of CDs and DVDs. therefore, Systemadministrator rights are needed, therefore you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b;. here you can proceed general program settings. nearly all functions of & K3b; should work on applicants. this dialog is intended for personalize and for the tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, as many others & kde; -applications also, with a & DCOP; -interface is equipped with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality might be controlled by a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the commandline program, or the slightly more comfortable program called Kdcop. both programs are exactly the functional and the type of your task is crucial to give you the help programs you pass.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you can use the commandline program dcop. to use the & DCOP; you need to make sure you need to make sure that & K3b; then enter something like the following an der console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; -functions that have all & kde; -programme in common, supports & K3b; mainly two more parts, which are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b; features functions like copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for generating new projects available.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPUS createDataProject () DCOPRef. createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef. () void copydd () int formatDvd () void hnCdImage (curl url) bool burnDvdImage (curl url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject procedure one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: Dumbref (K3b, K3bProject-0) alternative to obtain a reference to the project by using # dcop K3b K3bInterface currentProject Durch, using this reference, it is possible to change the project about K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above ProjectInterface and the high-performance K3bDataProjectInterface, which is only applicable on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring pattern) bool addUrl (curve:: List URLs, Qstring File) void setameItem (Qstring path, Qstring hostname) void setVolumeID (Qstring path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folder and then insert files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3bInterface createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / onnfile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; released and stored in WAV files saved on the computer (excluding and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or other formats such as the funnel-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiologator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), ogging up to (for OGG) or other body distributions are already available, so it is very likely not necessary for any Linux distributions are already available, it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something itself. if for example the stove is not used, its installation is also not necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While setting up only once needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found), then the daily handling of reading a & CD; this results (hopefully) for understanding of the slender approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble in the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main-presenting dialog of & kaudiophator; with different credit cards (such as encoder, for setting up the encode). so, you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This section describes sound quality, coworker and compression rates, and helps you in choosing the right body.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a losure audio format is needed. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' hormones' or 'monkey' that may possibly be available for this distribution. the drawbacks are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can be re-typed.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information through data compression, depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have the most common. OGG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences are less important as both body produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be provided with most distributions but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high setting quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality in deeper recognition.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playqudevices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - If any music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special Auto-stereo systems. today - initially only the MP3 format only supported the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the tunable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex tunes and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a titels. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint Stereo, Kompressive rate approximately 11th 128 kbps for all pieces of a titels. good enough for music by youths, portable devices and autostereoanlagen. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane's = 320Kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information collected manually or fetched by the program is automatically fetched from the freeDB about the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & coaudiophator; and the co-editor program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programmes, there is often a combination of program settings for the codictator and those parameters. the manual or the help of the codiers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) add if MP3s are coded with lame, the switches wtt by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiophator must be added. the result looks as follows: '... -tt {gender}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & colaudiophator; parameters that can be used (= Knopfbedrawing in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what is the freeDB is: a free database, to read up the audio CDs, the information go up instead of entering into the calculator. it is noted that here only a text is spoken by: & CD; title, artist, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes it should be legal, but I (anm. the Ueberries) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no more or less valuable, so neither the artist can still be inflicted on the music company. all information can be attributed to a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiologator; actively choose an email address (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used by another (counterfeit) address used in the system. in this manner of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address while retrieving the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are many countries copies of the main database. if & kaudiologator is set up; for the use of freeDB will be required, the geographical position is to be used on the next-lying mirror server. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of reflection for the online recall of & CD; information while reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly to only the actualizations of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that it is going to be cdparanoia; who wants to know more precisely, look at source code... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to keep in mind that the cdparanoia package has to be installed at first if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For storing the released WAV files, the Kodiver and therefore the desired file format will be chosen. for the first opening, there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a compressed compression for audio data) on the tab of the Kodierers. other codictator can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package has to be installed by the relevant Linux distribution, before the body used can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined body dictator. more information about Kodiers are in the chapters of the Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a codification, further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consoles window (eg; console; it must be replaced by the name of the installed cooker.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setting of the device designation of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is false.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this may give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the entire manual, everything understood but are somehow still unsafe what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, and read our first & CD; we will lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyers (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you still have them (eg; by trying to copy something into the form).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiophator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for every ending & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the deducting body quality (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program with which freeDB will use to load the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it in any reading a & CD; if the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The devictor drawing is handed over to the leship program so it can read the & CD; -Data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link on the actual device-drawing of your disk. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be specified too, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the degeneration awards for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map list of General settings. here you don't have much to do. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example, everything will be as instructed / as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if you are asked for uncomplete information, so that you will be informed when details are missing from keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card-card CD; simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected while reading the & CD; to connect to the Internet, so that it can access to the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second choice is simple, is a & CD; entry found, starts immediately the reading of & CD;. that is associated with the database entry and the filename / filename or day entries, they can easily changed. the directories / filename is changed with conquerors &gt; rename and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, please note: if you want to manually re-install the Choices of the freeDB will not be used. however, you can use the database previously. for freeDB in the offline mode, these two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set on the following map card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freeDB for us freeDB. these are settings for the data inquiry, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server about the Internet. how does the system, which data to get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put it all as it is pictured in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">The CDDB Server: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this road, the load between the hosts is distributed. however, this setting will work as a first attempt then.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equally attributable to the server, since many Firewall is running the protocol 8880 by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP; protocol typically open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send a & CD; data to the freeDB server should be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Do you simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">The number of simultaneously resulting pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time only one existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know how easy it is.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last bit, please tick this to the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this folder, then / must be indicated the path / folder in which the WAV files is present. this can be useful if only space on another drive is present. if the box does not interconnect the files in private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something using WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything is as simple as it is in the screenshot. the command is somewhat long, under certain circumstances something must be filtered through right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, one setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo are sufficient. the resulting bitrate is average approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the restriction of the tags on version 1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2'tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'Tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the procedure (including the full path) and output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Move the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously to coding WAV files: with dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to run more than an .WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiophator; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a & CD; if you've chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, described how the process of reading the & CD is organized to the hard disk. we will build MP3 files, the way the music is arranged on the hard drive, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be described. the process which is described in this section must be repeated for every ending & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, the screensavers is a little different than the data for a & CD; with successfully managed by freeDB data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually enter instead of picking them out of the Internet. comments are indicated on the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not die & CD; this example is to find. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must now be defined into the drive, which is defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; can be identified as audio CD; and can be identified by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you look in the section questions and answers according to the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD has been successfully fetched from the freeDB, all tracks of the pieces are already filled out, and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key to your & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion the best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you don't have the crossroads for automatic retrieve of freeDB (on page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, you need the data from the internet, you need the connector on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - entering the CD-data and the titels of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen foto. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'updates title', the rest of the data in the textfield 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist does not have to be given more in the input field 'updates title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividuell per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after the successful recall of the data from the freeDB is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editors, so that you are not just starting with the artist and album names (such as if all words with uppercase letters start or not...) but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1-tags. this limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary volume. if you use ID3v2-tags, you have unlimited fuel-length, at least on what is & kaudiophator; maximum. this option is set on the tab 'tab'. please take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the day information of the generated files later at any time with the Day editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags will not be assisted by all co-workers or file formats. see the body's help to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously associated with the style of the PSU CD. in this example, this is not important as we do not submit the & CD; for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, are under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After the choice of 'OK' come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album already packed with the entered dates, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply specify the entries for the fields of the current piece. simply specify the entries for the fields of the piece. in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way to you all the titles of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freeDB database. it is already sorted in one of these categories of database.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Note that there has a check-sign in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked with. a simple click on the line turns out the selection of piece, or select the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is encoding of play 1 into the format MP3. therefore take out reading and encoding parallel. please note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration settings to suppress this behavior. the only one seems configurable, is the number of parallel processes for reading and code. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with a AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous erasing and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the codiers. after the last piece is coded, a small window will finish a little window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select open... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with whose help you can choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; -window will also be falling with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of piece, open it and pressing the button list in the toolbar, select the entry entries from the menu piece or enter the leaks.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; window. (in several types it will be added to a collection and then played in succession.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a play takes place, you can jump in any place by using the middle mouse button and go out with the controller.</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set out what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined to activate a song so you do not manually set the karaoke text entry. but you still have the opportunity to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">In case you want to set up an event type, select from the menu settings the entries of Texpropriations or loungers. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. these are played in the series. in this section, you can use the collections effectively.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open all the collectors. you will find this in the menu collection under the item.... click on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will be included in the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust them in each collecting collector.</seg>
<seg id="1638">To the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to no other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection will not be saved. concerns you when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collector style. there, you can add a song with the button. it again appears in the dialog dialog, with whose help you can choose the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the adjustment of automatic transmission to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If an automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is inserted in the opening (under the use of file opening or drag) automatically to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatisch add to the collection is not enabled, the opening of a piece the temporary collection is activated and executed. this collection will then continue to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open to the collectors "collection, select the collection and the desired song and then click removal.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the set off from the sub-menu, select the menu, the songs will be played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or select a random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">In order to play a song, select it in the collector style, or use the selection list over the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song, select the next one-way song, the entry next song from the menu or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to jump back a song, select the button previous piece, the entry-previous piece by the menu pieces or press the key arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collectors "collection, select the collection and click on the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, however, this does not matter as they are not saved at the leaving of & kmid; it is not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events in events which sees the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change Patch to Trumpet and therefore always allows the trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you do not need a MIDI map, because all Soundmaps GM are compatible (including Awe - and CIS -cards, FM-devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. therefore, you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favourite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file, which saves all necessary settings for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear so often as desired. a precondition for this is, however, that each appearance has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap"... END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END Now... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map-file as e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; Support can provide for devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section the patches of General MIDI on your specific keyboard can be illustrated. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the leftist side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches are in the correct sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to set all notes that will need this instrument to hit the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported by thread (GM-patch 127), you can give a drum (e.g. with ton 60), which is similar to a gun powder. this will carry the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is placed in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Drum Patch the Patch is meant to be a different perussionist in the patch (Drum, basin, Maracas & etc;), and does not the one in which the tone represents the sound-height of the always same drum (like him some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to specify the sounds on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As for the PATCHMAP section the order of the lines is very important, as their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define a number of keycards for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to display notes on the perky channel. look for example the supplied kekmaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. if you want to spend example the first and second channel, just do it in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have a percussion on a particular channel (general MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi-Geräte uses 16 channels, CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, depending on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is pictured on the canal. if you use the keyboard option, the keymap will naturally be defined in the file name for this canal. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events are ignored, that try to change the patch on this canal. in this case, a patch is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to keep track-on-touch patch on the perky channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio is to be multiplied with the value Pitch-Bender events. so if a MIDI file sends a Pitch file with the value n, this will be used with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then first passed on. the value of 4096 is not used, so in the map file no decimalcommas stand.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed, because GM predominates that a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender event, with the value of 4096, a tone higher to play. unfortunately, try to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. these can be found in the menu below settings, item MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole range of keyboard (one for every MIDI channel). on these keyboard, see what sounds just being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, the knob is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original tool is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to indicate the played notes. you choose in the menu settings below the point of view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. if you find, e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc.. so you can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices with very different results, just like two different musicians could play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I cannot force anybody, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; if that's happening, because & kmid; without Awe support, you have to download a source distribution and install (for example by kmid; 's home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Do not agree, support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & konqueror; to choose all the files from and drag them onto the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, the setting will necessarily create an automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can taste the arrow taste on the left of the template LCD, to slow down the playback. to restore the tempo tempo you can double click the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & connector; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop, I have to play a MIDI file or I want to play a file, only switch into the & conqueror; window to switch the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the adjustment of an automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file is added to temporary collection add-by files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you only want to play the first file. therefore, you only need the setting of an automatic addition to the collection and open Emid. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent to me MIDI files or Postcards. all heartfelt thanks! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me the, further to & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where they can download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me simply happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a huge pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or to a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, if you want to send a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; totally in my spare time and have been defeated by anyone for money. I therefore want to emphasize that I will only be more programmatic because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to pick up the prevalent links below the bookmark rates, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are replayed to each other, so you should use the category thumb playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional frequency archive. if you exert an entry, his group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and play the playlist with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanency playlist may also be changed by direct shareholder of XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & kmplayer. you can easily choose the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer. by using the menu view. by the clicks of a subgroup, only the XML content is displayed this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing of XML files, the menu must be chosen from the menu with playlist and be chosen either in the processing mode, or chosen another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost if the removal mode leave or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ends can be disabled by the edite by ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and Change by [General Terms] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; the files will be ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / ..xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be an supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at the start does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, it would be annoying, however, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; bodywork; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit; / bodywork; In the source package of & kmplayer; are in the directory tests / some examples of smil die of & kmplayer; supported.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the slarder size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playgrounds in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured with manual processing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaymc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla.</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR supports support of kmplayer only Xvideo, Xvideo should also work (presumably, this type of playback of video equipment is the only that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux must be functional for the X server (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI, file is enclosed in the filter- and there is no call by & eyepiece; after quick-construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In looking at the beating toolbar, the three types of selection should be striped out for the fast integration of common elements into the document. the first selection is for the rapid integration of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... the verbal & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>

<seg id="1785">Having shown the background for writing the source language with the & latex; -option language, now follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the assistant a little text was typed, a few adjustments need to be accomplished for the better readability of the document. below, you should see a quotation, a few places in the lipid and cimprint and a poem to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed via editor or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). if an external viewer, the window needs to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI, file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a large-independent file format (engl.

<seg id="1790">For printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as required for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - by clicking on DVI, the document can be printed (in the viewer) printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar expresses the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI, file consists of the & latex; -source code was created, the conversion will begin to squeezed other formats using the sounds in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The previews embored the direct leap from the editor to each point within the DVI, file.</seg>

<seg id="1794">To compensate for previews, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of source, and leep up on the weep search tool. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; -viewer will then take place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this feature in & eyepiece, with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI, document the corresponding & latex; document by & kile; geÃ ¶ ffnet and the corresponding row are sung. on this needs & kile; in & eyepiece, are defined as a text editor (settings eyepiece f...

<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window to choose from the template is displayed for the document. the preset possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">Selecting leeres document can be written a document either from scratch or the assistant to quickly create a new document. more information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-sensitive users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates in & kile; created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either a existing & tex; - / latex; file loaded or a new file will be created. & kile; a new template is created by means of an existing document and a selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template used by file, some characters are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which character chains are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is used by entering document types:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the verbs of commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps have been performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document it can be balanced by default, instead of by default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one in the Internet and the steps below are taken through the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the enjoyment of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be carried out in the MENU tools directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more Ã ¼ ber & Kate; and his possibilities to experience, the manual for Kate should be applied. users of & kile; can start working directly with the editor's work with the editor of & Kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; a command reference, which can be called the MENU's using LaTeX reference. it contains an executable description of virtually all commands that can be found in & latex; usage as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with drÃ ¼ ckter strg button to squeeze the & tex; -word meaning that in this way, clicking on\\ by\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When chasing the text with geverbal linker button, the balanced text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">With the use of the arrow buttons with penetrated Shift and can be washed out parts of the source language in the editorwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to search for different kinds of source texts and differentiate them. for example, the & latex; commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistant might be merged in addition to one's own type of bookmarks within the text. in this case, it is an own type of bookmarks or the corresponding keynote testify to the next or last Sprungmars. thereby, this spray stamp is highlighted, so that it is automatically generated when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Working is probably one of the main aspects when designing a program such as & kile;. although & Kate; important features for writing a & latex; important functions for writing a & latex; special orders for their selection. under deficides, the following commands have been given to the text-selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">WÃ ¤hlt a complete paragraph (group of lines shown on both sides a blank lines). this extended meaning is associated with the tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of source language. the only exploitative cause in & kile; is thus that the sÃ ¤tze are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">WÃ ¤hlt the word under current cursorimposition. this choice also has an extended meaning as this command also & latex; commands with a return puff (\\) and a sending star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To the construct of a part of the document it can be removed and by pressing the key Entrance will be removed. & Kate; offers the keyword Ctrl; K with which the whole row is removed. & kile; offers the following commands to the length of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description to manipulate paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarifies that environments poses a central role in & latex; therefore, it offers & kile; for additional commands under working environment, an easy work with & latex;</seg>

<seg id="1825">In the entry of many screwed ambient command can quickly be lost in the inferous view. this command asures the most recently-established surroundings, so that the welded ambient structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile, also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups that are determined by brackets {...} are a few important commands that meet those of working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command becomes the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the squabed clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command is sung to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the squabed clamps.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor over or behind the soft clamps of a & tex; group # is located, the other end of the group is sung (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many welded groups of staples may quickly be deprived of the inferous view. this command ascertains the most recently-established group, so the entrenched structure of the & tex; groups cannot be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple trials are used as a choice. for the purpose of being used in & kile; the character "for two simple trials are used. also, for the end of the trial, the character is used." & kile; he knows this case and bring two insolete character.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already, a good source code has been installed, these in & kile; in order to have special orders (usually for & latex;) further commands (usually fÃ ¼ r & latex;). they are three according to demand and the other two are for the automatic encryption. all these modes can be set for different workings under settings Kile... compass.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} is & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When translating the skate taste the last letter of the input will be removed and you would appreciate it as a result of the compressed list. on the other hand, the list may also be decreased by entering another letter too.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, descriptions are collected by & kile. alternatively, you might be filmed by & kile; also springmarks, enabling a simple jump to these positions via satisfaction brands NÃ ¤chste Sprungmarke really like and can be filtered.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings kile; set up... kile; commanding settings to these lists are made. it can be used various whÃ ¶ rterlists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher des general linguistic.</seg>

<seg id="1983">Send a HTTP requirement to the server to request a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to see the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the View Debugger issue.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger, to start the execution of the script and to send information on the surveillance variables as well as the current evaluated line constantly. if this happens when the script is stopped, the script is continued even before a Debuganclaim has started, the script will start using the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger, to begin with the execution of the script, without sending information to surveillance variables and the current tick number. if this happens, while a script is attached, the execution continues before a Debuganrequest has been given, begins the execution as soon as a requirement is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger introduces the next directive in the script without intercting in the functions or concerns.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger introduces the next directive on the script, although possible in functions and includes concede.</seg>

<seg id="2048">Following the creation of the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this happens beyond the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the use button and continue with other tags, so it still gives, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar, or it should adjust them to better survey by some separators into multiple groups. make sure that the toolbar set the toolbar selected by setting the toolbar. ensure that the toolbar selected is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the denominator (on the left top) for my toolbar. according to the selection of the elementary propositions, which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow-button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the denominator aid the grouping. anyone who doesn't know my toolbar, could believe that the & Conqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button is.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by sampling of all symbols, to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. once new XML does not exist, it will be applied in the correct folder (s), but your toolbar (s) should be saved in the correct folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar will be loaded (n) if a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like. therefore, this chapter like I first describes a & PHP; Documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might be in & quantaplus; -Repository, whether someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. in the first part, we let you go to the second one here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [tree] Doc dir = path, relatively to this file, to the documentations (e.g. php42 / # element = Sec2.3.html Image 2 = func2.html func2 = func2.html -1 = tag2html -3 = days.html -3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree. for example, you can see it in PHP & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html - Language Reference = language.basic-syntax .html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before-started and Language Reference. it indicates that this is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chaction (except by reason) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Remember that the table directory is referenced directly on a file (and unwavering at the top of the construction supervision & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Space-signs affect nothing, but pay attention to & and & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resourcendateien.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content-section is the area of the docrc file, which is to be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array -functions. by flagging of the functionalities and pressures of Ctrl; H for context aid, documentation would directly appear. there are only two types of entries here: the checkslist (ContextList) and the file-binding.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of through-separated context elements which should be available (for & PHP;, these are the features of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and share a folder after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as described in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation have been utilized to the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; are you not alone. it is possible to divide the resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can send by email to friends, partners or otherwise whom will be sent. in different places there is an With e-mail menu including DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) send to email, toolbar by file and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archives, from where all others & quantaplus; -users can download them and only available if our team needs them to be correct and useless for publication. thus, the origin of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When loading, you are asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys you will need to edit an item. in the dialog New resource needs to be desired (URL preview may be empty) and by clicking on OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The high-load can upload from the menus DTD DTD-Package (DTEP), toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signature. if the integrity given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; it is possible to work time by setting up a DTEP package. it can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files in tag could be necessary. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from DTD charging and converging a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD's description that is to be used. then, the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target-name: the newly created & DTEP; is written by this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DocBook Defining line: the string that is in! Documents day, such as HTML PUBLIC / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">The setting of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; according to the conversion to the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this opportunity to utilize.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantitative, there are some key concepts. to understand them and get full benefit from & quantaplus; therefore they have to bring along with these fundamental concepts. this chapter is trying to bring them to these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; some benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, divided the working area into three fields: global, local and project. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus, who is available. this enables the administrator of administrators to secure the tooling, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items are a personal collection of web developers for a single user. they are user-specific patterns and toolbar. local items are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related items are available only within a specific project. this can be all of & CSS; patterns up to toolbar with special promotions specifically for the files of a certain project. simply stated, this is the most complete size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which means sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">Das & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several key areas: the Editorwindow, the construction views, the boxes with information and the toolbar. please refer to and for further information about these fields.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the map with the right mouse button to obtain an account menu with the current document, such as close the current, other or all cardboard, recharge, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right menu in the editorial department lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cutting / paste / paste), processing of the file under the mouse-cursor, or opening the file when the string under the mouse-cursor calls a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editorfenstadder, the toolbar is introduced. presently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is presented as standard, for which a set of toolbar is demonstrated. in the course of further expansion of & quantapathy; the toolbar is adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert in a simple day, for example & lt; then click on the icon which has shown the day. if they want to insert the data for this just attached day (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The builders (QIT;) enable it to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; navigate to them and roam. in the presentation with cardboard boxes are available for files, project, model, document attributes, documentation, attributes, and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows the customary files in the project by means of right mouse click. actions like Add, Delete, upload, or delete the files from the storage media with the displayed contingent menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another opportunity to quantaplus, is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project. more about templates is found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts in Global, Local and Project. by clicking on the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script. on the right mouse button, more features are available, such as the script to boot, edit or send with your mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one points the internal structure of the active document. through links-clicking on the element of the element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. through the right-clicking on an element, a list of commands with respect to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other Baumanviews. with it, can change manrapidly attributes and namespace. that focuses on the content of concrete admission system allows modification of all available attribute names with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for finding the web technique for your development. you can download prepacked documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, one can create their own documentation, and by adding a folder to a project can be added to the project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two smerled at the bottom of the window, using the beneficial information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This map shows information about each in Quanta ongoing script. that is, for example, the DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD currently displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This map shows all faults in the market-up of the current document. & quantaplus; - script that will be executed, give all error messages (so it gives) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Die & quantaplus; Werktooling are extensive and easy to understand. indicate a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the toolbar of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; when they receive a toolbar in an email, they can only secure this in & quantaplus, like any other and invite you!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable, if you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus; files to your system. therefore, autoconf file to get to the configure script. to give a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble passing von & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before their bin's folder. same counts for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus, is a web-phase tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus, was optimized for a quick web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; -Editor, the developers of & quantaplus, who would be that if & quantaplus; now, this would make him the absolutely greatest Web-course tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus, so far too far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarised, if you can define it in & XML; then it ought to quantaplus; therefore the appropriate & IDE;</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above must be maintained that & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why developers, what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffold not only this is possible, but permits users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand how they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus, allowing webdevelopers to increase the usage of a intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. by means of having self-coated actions, scripts and toolars, without worrying out a scripting language tax. (more about it you find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for quick web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers made the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details the documentation is help with help: / quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / quantitative).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; it is currently developed and followed by Eric Laffoon cuLC @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file that is not located, the oldest entry is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section about templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project presner folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts in inserting the clipboard there is special characters for & HTML; logotype, so that they are displayed correctly and not by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; option which is the correct way to insert special characters and blanks in & URL; s is used primarily to insert & URL; s into the chor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables the blockers to or out. that allows you to choose text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. that is very helpful if your & PHP; -script gfixes!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Is searching for a string or regular expression in the chosen directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined press to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window, or not. that is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exit and switching of the problem-reporters at the bottom of the & quantaplus; captain. the problem center will be activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolcolumn left from the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If bookmarks are contained in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the tag .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searched the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows, e.g. video files into your project folder or a subfolder, and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">The files in your project invites the server high. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded additional inputs / output modules (KIO Slave).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in Chapter & quantaplus; -projects can be found the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are kept in project you / toolbar and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that only creates the name. actions must be stored using settings of actions... stored by toolbar to store the toolbar that you want to store the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this does not deletes it from the hard drive. if you have not saved the toolbar, you are asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This means that you can send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus; -Team, so that the toolbar is available in the next publication). the menu item will open a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbar to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; that you or irting anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Recharge / refresh the entities from the & DTD;. is useful when the entities to renew the whole & DTEP; if this global is and a writing permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the shop failed.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu includes a list of tags, which are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is submenu standard in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day's setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insert of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting a toolbar if this day goes against the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed below the above-mentioned menu item. anklicken Sie. anklicken</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax-mechanism for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on derkate; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of Zeilenende identification. very useful when you know people, the other OS platforms to apply. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application of tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate reversal between the different types of the interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the circumstance sometimes need some time or create uncomfortable graphics. recommended that the box Card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for every open subwindow. with selection of an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Splits the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; the main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog include every application that use the KHTML-Part, including the & Conqueror; -Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Judge the behavior of the Editorfenstr. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, where you can delete entries from the toolbar, which you can add or change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a manual corresponding to the environment of the mouse-cursor but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus, is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always need help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development of financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed most from top to bottom, e.g. after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be automatically completed. all these paths and author efields can be set later with Shift; F7 Project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to give, for example foo. when entering the name file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; -Project file. by default, she has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is saved in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine to which one wants to access, one, except you get your local data. either a name (hostname.un.de) or an IP-address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the standard settings of the selected logs are used. depending on the adjustment of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default, if a common collection of files are used for various projects, this folder should be discontinued instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by standard toolbar. if a common collection of files are used for various projects, this folder should be discontinued instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows files to include files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or whole folder can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. on serverside script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Stopping, if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project, should be involved. if a project is emerging from scratch, not anaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all the files and folder will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a proper selection to the thin.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by typhooks, or, by removing hemorrho, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that can simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project-properties in the lower profile, or change the shortcut shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filename (wildcard possible) which are to be ignored in the project-related operations like the project ordner.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplemental option on the top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project perspectives, which is loaded at the opening of the project. in this case more about project views can be read.</seg>
<seg id="2172">In this way the desired Debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be adjusted by the button Options. in this case the debugfixes is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">"" "in the subwindow profiles high-load profiles can be set (see in) as well as the display of a tool-view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing out their own belly-view for each profile." ""</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, processed or deleted as well as a mailing list. see for details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the underground event, one can switch event action, change or delete these actions, change or delete them. events promotions are executed when a previous event occurs, such as sightings of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, opens & quantaplus; the last project which was open. this behavior can not affect them at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open a different project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog is open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus, closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. same if you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project management gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders also behave, however, missing the entries are missing and open with... in the right mouse-click menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here, different profiles can be chosen. the profile contains information about the place of high-saving files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only more a profile is present, the button is canceled, to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in a core memory and has forgotten this possibility. this possibility is useful when most frequent uploading files is necessary and the rather uncertain password saved on the record -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">That will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-weight profiles can be uploaded and thus upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when working or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server, which should be copied to the files used. either a fully qualified domainname or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed KIO slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP; file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is recorded on the record, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming, it can easily see in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbar. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. through simple diagrams, different files and toolbar can be loaded and replacing the currently open files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted from the project toolbar, reachable or deleted from the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, who has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity but also enables the adaptation of & quantaplus; to his own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbar in & quantaplus; best about the menu toolbar. use and add different. add to the toolbar is treated down in the section Add-toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be adjusted either using Kontextmenu (right-click on the toolbar), the toolbar can be applied as toolbar, which can be applied to the dialog, which can be specified in the dialog, where actions on this or other toolbar should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu for an action (icon) on a toolbar, additionally the entries must remove action and edited action edited, which are self-explaining.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set in the menu using settings toolbar.. and set settings actions.. adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are located in essential toolchain, code cutlets and files to create linkages. & quantaplus; uses templates such as a common filesystem with advanced organisation and interfaces. you can copy, postpone or any at the system available directory in the pre-storage area. templates have in approximately the limitations you provide for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided Templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions at the beginning of each template led conditions before using precisely.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binder is all that is not purple text. it can be any file except text, so pictures, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc; binary templates are usually added in documents using linkups (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are available in the pre-storage area under global templates. more information about templates tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents can be created in corresponding subfolders. one makes a simple form for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate way to efficiently. some examples may be found in pre-storage space under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template but the same text area is always included in documents. you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or Perl's base. some examples are found in the warehouse area under global templates. see for more information about the templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, serving these templates for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarised in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples of & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure to Belieben (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File as a template and save as a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project position) the submission is not visible in the project tree. look at the pre-camp site under project requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and then click file as a template to save as local / project management. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with pulling and insert on the building content.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary Templates is simple: the file can only copy into a predisposition. it can be used all file management functions, such as pulling and insert, or inserting over the file tree of conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder right or in the project files. selecting a folder on the right and secure site template, secured a name for the template and secure. by default, it is guaranteed as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project requirements enable a very single-oriented approach. you can insert headlines and footprints, or dynamically with & PHP; in addition, you can keep some things in keeping with templates in projects very profound in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The pre-store structure in the subwindow templates is based on the in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quantitative and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quantitative / divide. each of this folder corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behaviour of a folder with right mouse button, click the folder and select in the context menu features. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is bottomed as soon as Elterliches attribute names.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and does not fit for anything except the regular folders indoors. if a tribal diffuser would be disable, it would appear explicitly in this path. in case of normal folder, the blasts would appear with something like text builders. if nothing appears, you probably will be in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be more general headlines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and allows headlines to equipping a folder of special headlines / footlines already using the matching headlines / footlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, we use the context menu (show them, right mouse button, press) through a complete command collection to add folders and paste from templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus, offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Quelltext-Editor, die über das Menü View sind. der erste mode replaces the HTML-Editor through the VPL; -Editor and the Zweite splitting the Editorwindow into two parts: the HTML-Editor and VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; -Editor works as follows: he invites a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn on demand for the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; -editor will be visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Working with the VPL; -editor in a document, which contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; to edit the code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; to edit the source code. there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works precisely like the first, except that the changes are visible in the source code as well as in the VPL, editor and the cursor in the source code editor and in the VPL; -editor will be active, this mode is already active, puts the key pressure on the active cursor from one window to another while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation interval between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is adjustable from settings Quanta. in selection can be set between synchronisation after a click or automatically. in addition, the timing can be set in addition to time span. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small margin for fast computers and a large margin for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so tools of the invisible tags at work with the VPL; -editor will also be called, as soon as a new document with the VPL; -Editor will be created once a new document with the VPL; -editor will be created. this is used to change the release of the suspension of codieting.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags will allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. key words for internet searchengines. meta elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. one click on the list allows modification of the content, e.g. key words on the column names and keyword key wort2 on the content -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new path to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS-rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. currently using CSS compliance is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to incorporate an external CSS-style content by pressing on the file button, and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of cursor is as described in a text processing, with due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor works like usual. text can be inserted through typing typed and delete a taste or deleaste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The inserting of tags will be made in the same way over the toolbar, as described in the source code editor, it is noted, that inserting the tags will be inserted previously already existing identical tags, e.g. if an anchor tag, surround by text, each other realging anchor is removed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparisons. why so & kdiff3; do you let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The meeting was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected it in many places. another programmers had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts at together.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the altered lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines - and there was no indication of the places where maybe just the re-shifts had changed. that changes, this change was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; differences emerge within a line and changes to white signs. later, plenty of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, copy it to the clipboard and add it to one of the simultaneous windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function which did a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost in a fully-run file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way together will be fully supported. this is useful when two people operate independently of each other in a piece of code. the original file (the base) helps to dissolve the results. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot showing three Quell files to merge with:</seg>

<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and dices against the possibilities of today's colors. if you often have to check the code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are visible. if only lines in a certain number of white signs are visible, one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no hassle more, if someone changes the re-shifts.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red paint means that both differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can ease the Tipyour work by using only the filename of the first file completely. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folders 1folder 2 kdiff3 folder folder kdiff3 folder folder kdiff3 folder, folder 2 folder, folder 2 folders 3 folders, folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog opens the manual input from file names, the selection using the file browser (file...) or selecting a most recently opened file from the list. you do not need to specify the third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files is executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the folder, you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons is selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If assembled, the input field is actively involved and can be dealt with. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately specify a output file. you can also get this step later on the storing.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens up a dialog with settings. you can set options before you start with the comparison.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; then allowing you to pull text parts from the clipboard in the active comparative window. the comparison begins then immediately. in the opening dialog, you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop you: drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a window window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these features are, this would be a relatively large effort. they'd first need to create two corresponding files they're in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy the relevant sections easily, and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can not pull out anything out of kdiff3; only the case type of text is supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpreting and remove text into another program than cut and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the top of each text window is the info-line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (when the path to a file is too long, the mouse will rest a while over the line. then a small aid window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three sources are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the colour blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can change over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in the colour, which file differs. if both files differ, the presets color is red for it. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (guide) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the pooling column. if differences were found, the color indicates the corresponding color. with some programming languages, where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, white characters are only relevant in character and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the summarizing column of the text is interrupted by the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line-file has been activated, the line is dotted by broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result of the result (under the comparative window) also has a info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [changed] when you have the product already done. usually it contains by the automatic compiled text already, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>

(this will also be a jump of position in the windows.) this group becomes the current group. it is highlighted with the color background color for current field and each other at the left is a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through conversion, or by manual returns no further line will remain in the group; then this is displayed in those lines of text; then this is only a space for the case that you may change your mind, and perhaps another source. this text is neither written in the final file, nor in a marker you might copy and put elsewhere.</seg>

<seg id="2316">In the Augabefenster you can also use the other keys to work. with the inserting button you can switch between insert and transcription mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns syncs the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already assembled in the section and the editable output forks has been explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last contrast, to the next / previous conflict (Strg image upward) or to the next / previous conflict (Strg picture) or to the next / forward conflict (Strg image later) or upon the manual, therefore, must be differentiated between resolved and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings into the clipboard, you must press the copying -button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl inserting). however, this option is automatically copied to the clipboard and install the manual copying. be careful with this option but cautiously because you might mistakenly sign the contents of the clipboard.</seg>

<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, then the original version is appy. if already such an oven with the Suffix .orig exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current ongoing program. you need to exit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available, because the language is set globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following exposition settings can be adjusted for each entry separately. if one activates this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Over the selection points for the coding appears a brief reference, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has for you purely informal nature.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the code encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpret. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and combined.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding for storing is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-editing process, you might not work with your codec (for example, your files can be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only control with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can define the coding of the output of pre-processing transforms.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppresses the highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or review terms. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore either C / C + +.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. depending on the selection of A & lt; -gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is adjacent to the normal nor a second overlap column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. take the less important window. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Displays the comparative side next to each other or another. this can also be useful for viewing many long lines. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then select immediately the files merge together. a simple click start the merge and used the filenames of the last source file as preset names for output file. (if this function is used to start the file again, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be transferred to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own processor, which corresponds exactly your requirements. for example, you can use this function for example to cut off-out parts or correct the reimiter.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is specified first to this external command. if a text command is specified explicitly (see above), then the output of command will be used only in line processing. you can write your own processor, which corresponds exactly your requirements. each input line must have a random output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diet results. however, for this, an external program requires, and most users do not want to program ourselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl totally sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-control command for ZeilenabÃ ©\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generated text files: sed /\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs which support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing transitter. sed's / [0123456730.00 -] / / g 'Jep character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to make multiple settings at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' allerygers are required at perl some details differently. where sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preessor are maintained for viewing and together. the other operations can only change the data that the line algorythmus can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the cab terminally sees the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The prep commands are very useful, but as with every function, the text changes or differences, you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often you need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder reversiv and merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge together; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can merge the simulate and shows the simulated changes without being really performing,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to comparisons, and merge individual files very similar. you just need to specify a folder in the command line or in a dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folder are assembled, the folder 1 is used as base. if no target-folder has been specified, used & kdiff3; Ordner3 as a target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not start together, you must select the corresponding menu item or press the F7 button. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will inform you a small message window through current progress. if you break the scanning the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, shows & kdiff3; a utility window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that has been found during the scan here, is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded, by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - and selecting the arrow buttons for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories and directories all subdirectories that you can install all the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file comparison is started and it appears a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the type of file is different in different folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the cooperated action can not be chosen automatically. if the collapse you have started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the columns A / B / C are used in red, green, yellow, and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the colour is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their overall content is identical. then also folder the same color. at folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a workpiece, which is only green, then yellow becomes, and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of data (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. so long as such incomplete objects may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of data (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such incomplete objects may exist, it may not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to be identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: save together and save the result in both folders. (the user sees visible data stream for output file only B; direct after the merge and kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folder will be combined and select the undiffuse file, then examine & kdiff3; the date of files and proposes the newer file to copy before. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, that can be squeezed the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While the collapse you run a file after the other. you check status column shows Fertig, when it has been performing successful, and appropriately other messages, if something unexpectances entered. if this is accomplished, you should make a final review and check if the status is right everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If "" "" "" "if in the" "" "flyer" "" "Full analysis" "", "Kdiff3 additional columns will be displayed. these include the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and whiter conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three files are compared or combined.)" ""</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either conduct the chosen item (file or Odner) or all entries at once. if you have selected all coaches actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a target folder, then in the three-folder mode, it will be used as a destination in the two-folder association, B as a destination and will be synchronize A and / or B as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder, also in folder structure. there are some options covered by certain entries. check these options to avoid unsatchy surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To perform all entries: select directory-assembled / continue in directory -menu or press F7 (the shortcuts). to perform only the current setup: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If due to conflicting file types still misinvalid actions exist, a message appears on the faulty items pointing out. you can then select a valid action.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you are performing all entries, a dialogue window with the options run through, simulate and interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate when you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge an individual file), then a manual window will pop up (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're finished with a file, select once again filesystem / continue or press F7. if you have not saved, appears a corresponding dialog. then leads to kdiff3; its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; look at an error, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list you see some error messages that will help you to try to select the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select a different action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you start running together.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries are individually assembled, these items (in the current session) and then merge them at a later result of all entries not once again, these entries are considered to be done. only when you manage the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that suit the specified pattern will be displayed in the elementary-tree. there are multiple patterns displayed. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid values: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default. the default do not comply with this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folder that suit this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be inserted more than a pattern, use the semicolon; a Placeholder: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folder that suit this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree. it can be inserted more than a pattern, use the semicolon; a Placeholder: '*' and '?'. preset is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. many autmatic files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted according to a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filtering systems, files have a error-attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary tree or not. this option is turned into default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">With links to files: when the option is switched, symbolic links are compared. when the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in preference.</seg>
<seg id="2407">At links to folder: when the option is switched, the links will be switched on. if the option is switched, the links like normal folder will examine and recursively searched. (note that a link on a folder containing a link on itself would lead to a final loop.) This option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file and shows the statistic columns. (the number of solved, unresolved analysis, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is more slow than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files that does not contain text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder over a slow network, it is likely to compare faster, only the change date and the file size. however, this speed advantage is a certain level of security. please use with caution. this option is subdudes in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly as familiar with the Change date. there is no real comparison, but the files are identical. for example, it may be useful when copying the change date. please use the caution when copying the change date. please use this option in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronizing mode when two files are compared and no target batch file was specified so that afterwards both folder are identical. also the results of merge files are stored in both folders. this option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are variations, the copying of the newer file proposed as action is proposed. (this is considered to be insecure, because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted, the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .Orig. if an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, then this will be deleted without further backup. that also affects the normal combined folder. this option is switched on the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder view contemplating that create individual files; you can switch to the window panels with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch the mainwindow in the window to switch off, using a change between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-click. however, there is also a corresponding menu item. you can also merge an individual file directly without the folder menu. once you save the result, the status will be done and the file will not be merged once you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost though you again read the directory: directory: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports networking with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 use this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders for the opening, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a file server. the second command line compares a folder in a compressed file with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should you consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relatively undet. or.. included. that's not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mashed. (# - &gt;% 23, blank - &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the used protocol. it follows a brief list of constraints:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to process permissions or modification of change. therefore, avoid the entitlements or the change of changes from the original. (please see the option confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main reference purpose is currently the differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts always the built-in differences-viewer. to launch Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences-viewer, and then select in Kdiff3parts from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete inputs takes, takes a patch file in the Unified format. then, & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then it starts and kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the section, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. besides, this is not reliable, if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; when part is executed, it only supports the comparisons of two files, one very small toolbar and menu. that is together, or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the Kpart Mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now heels it complicare) are already available. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool-collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL-programs for a very long time and have learned a lot as I've learned in the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from sources and the configure-script probably does not find the correct prefix to KDE. in the default process install in / usr / local, but then KDE can find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, those lines are first treated as identical. if similar lines is treated as identical. if similar lines break next to each other, this is the attribute not the case is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor allows for any difference in the files where it begins and where it ends. that's necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking on the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost however, if the result is simply saved as text file and it is much effort to create extra your own file format that might save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too large. you can restore a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger amounts of text should be used another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src lindefeated; published and the text cannot be extinguished. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; many colors are already differentiated from differences. yet more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. use a different editor to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and troubled reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; take advantage of, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE, click on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the latest changes using http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / changelog or in the changelog file.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; install and install, use the following command at the base folder of & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automate used, you should not experience any problems with the compile. nevertheless, you should experience difficulties, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutting (Ctrl or Sizes) copies in the clipboard and deletes the marked text. inserting (CtrV or Umschalt paste) adds the text from the clipboard at the current rate-position, or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences see: files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure, and consequently also not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current programme version you have to update about changes to these options the folder with the function refresh.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. that also results that identical files are not already copied into the target folders. if the target-folder these files does not already contain, they are missing in a later program version.) This option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the marking A, B and C below the menu bar. if you are clicking on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in result window (if the lines are already available), they are removed by clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In preference, this option is deactivated. Underdifferences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a mini-presentation of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the ongoing programs on the labour area, to change its size, to finish them or to postpone it. this works both inside a desktop and more.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even move on the desktop and to other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, window can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both within a working surface and on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked, if on the empty background of & kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager... and click. if however, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimizing, maximizing operations, on working surface and preferences.</seg>

<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the name of the virtual desktop is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Disciers this field can be made the & kpager; the numbers of the virtual desktops. it is composed, together with name indicated, the names containing ordinals are provided, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>

<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as a small window in & kpager; at the same time only the empty workspace will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with its default symbol and Pixmap displays a small view of the real program window. remark: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here can be determined by arrangement of the & kpager; -main window will be determined: classically be known as from Pager applications in some other wind-buttons; waiti displays all virtual desktops in an horizontal and vertical in a vertical set, which is very good for representation on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager minibus program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display the window as symbols or with their content and can also move outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click on the right mouse button within and kpager; and then choose a switch from switchers... lets the dialog settings appear.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool, emulates a mouse click, once the mouse cursor has been doing a while on the same place. it is meant to help people who are preparing the Repostitive Strainingrad (RSI) syndrome and those of every single mouse-click pain is preparing. however, this does not require a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool, can get the pain that arise at the mouse, and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also go to pain that are associated with the use of your computer, you should seek a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To get it clear: even if & kmousetool, pain helps with clicking on the mouse, it is against pain that are caused by the lack of mouse, useless. and as with all the ergonomic assistants, the result may vary for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool, monitors your mouse movements and guides a mouse-click if you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the smart toss activates, makes & kmousetool; a break after taking the squeeze of mouse button emulated. move the mouse, it waits until the end of the movement, before the slogan of the mouse button run. in this way you can drag the pulling with pressing right mouse. this way you can push the pulling with pressing right button. this way you can get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This corruption must be petrified following the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool, takes a mouse-click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is clever to push the filtering time (1 / 10 s) active. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting; after flowering the mouse button wait before it gets rid of the mouse again if the mouse has not been carried out of the mouse again.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool, now supports the clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, by clicking on the right and back, followed by a break, one click with right mouse button. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes .txt 'if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but it may be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shorten the reaction times; go to sound & multimedia, select sound system and here the rider General. there is a sliders sound-buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the answers.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, becomes & kmousetool; start with each start of & kde; start. this feature is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other linders, please consult the particular documentation to find out how to automatically start a program.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings on the values back, which were set in the opening of the dialogue. have you already compressed the button, the settings are put into effect after the last pressures of it.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best way to use & colmousetool, first of all with the presets. especially the intelligent Verpush you should initially switched off at first. if you then have accustomed to the automatic mouse you can then take on the intelligent relocating later.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, there may be necessary to decrease the answer pages of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse-click without effect remains: the clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window, which do not pose a link to uncertain reactions. you can therefore park the mouse in such places, until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse ruckelt, you should clean your mouse. it is usually fairly simple. the trick is that you don't just get the mouse ball, but also the roles that get in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take the mouse clicks. as this happens, from mouse to mouse differently. it should be clear however if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you've removed the bullet, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the contamination allows you to easily with flat blade or the rear-scratching scratching scratching.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you've just started an accident, it means that & kmousetool; the operation does not run any more by the point of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool, using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click. through this, the status of & kmousetool is set; withdrawn and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool, continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to place where you want it. however, park the mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you're a keystrosive reactions. thus, secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the Title of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent relocating, but I don't manage to edit it.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent relocating is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can deal with it. it is very probably possible to copy it in the clipboard and want to move again or move any other action, in which you want to move the mouse in pressing mouse button. here are some advice to make:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the intelligent relocating if you're just starting to begin using & kmousetool; take a mouse click below and hold the Shift key, while you move the mouse-cursor to the other end of the text and again select the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. it is jedesmal, if & kmousetool; the mouse pushes a sound like a mouse click OK. then you know exactly when when the intelligent relocating the break-time begins. later you can use the smart relocating even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the Xtest extension for & X Window; installed on most system already the case.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a soundcard and loudspeakers, and it is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool, pressing the mouse button once the mouse-cursor is short, this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RSI's syndrome and those who are getting the amount of the moplastic soreness.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool, can also be configured now that there is a certain time waiting for a stand operation, before the mouse button is left. in this way, the pulling and downturn can be performed with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & kton;. for normal work with & kton; filter is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text is processed before being sent to the Speech Dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation in order to select wrong words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and spokesman, or to handle certain shortcomings of language synthetic qualities and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters is important to know how the program "Speech dispatcher" works with a text. & ktan is different from texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen sails has the highest priority. it will be subtracted to all other orders and holds these orders. if the issue of Screen Reader has been read, the orders were raised again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is becoming hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next priority. a message subjecting normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application to read the news. while you leave & eg; a long text on a web page, you can enter with & kmouth; someone who has just strolling through the room. & kde; -alerts are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple textbook. each order that you encounter on cardboard card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of applications that are used for text applications.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of order are made in queue, with the exception of the screen of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen player, during & ktay; just one such reads, this edition is raised and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the issue of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text, as well as on & kde; -News applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and enter it on the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in future, there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Drawing board eretzer replace parts of a text by other text. the removable parts can give you either as words or as a regular expression. & ktan; is provided with predefined cartoon animations like: -) through text or for the reverse of messages; or & kmail; to provide a better understanding.</seg>

<seg id="2633">With interpreting filtering, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent text to & kton; if for example, if you have set up a female voice, you can read the text by KDE-messages about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which he is applied for a voice issue. if the filter does not exist, it gives the text unchanged at the next filter next.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification of & amp; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters hit the page below. processing by the filter is displayed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filters and it will be shown on the below setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For installation of string generation filtering, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions. if these patterns will be displayed in the text, then the text will be replaced with the corresponding subtext. large and small-scale will not be observed when compared to the title.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Set a name for your filters. this name can choose any number, it needs to be different from the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regulatory expressions. the filter does compares the text with the string in the column, and replace it in accordance with the string of column. the list is displayed in the indicated order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; -changing filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile it, you need a new development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or newer) including the packages kdeler and the wicker files for the program "Speech Dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to source codes used by & amp; out of the source text archive or downloaded all the night currently unspecified, install and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you & kton; use, check first if Speech dispatcher works correctly with your language synthesizer. this allows you to use the shellscript SPD-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktis; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktan; 4.4 is the first version of Speech Dispatcher. the program kttmsgr is to be further developed that the furnishings of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script SPD-conf is no longer needed.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and statutes' filter (SDB-Filter). SBDs subdivide the text into individual sentences, because only the first sentence has to be synthesized, not the whole text order. this allows you to also stop or stop orders or break down, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the statutes of statutes' filter. at the first start of & kton; it is automatically set up as a proposition. you can change its settings, or add additional statutes' filter, beginners will not fail.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Most simplest learn how to set up the choice of Speech by sample. place your speaker selector, change some properties and check out how the selection of the speaker. therefore, you have to set up more than a speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& amp; then faster to start to read, since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then stop using text orders on cardboard card or Cancel, even if the voice synthesizer this function does not support.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal statutes of transfers is automatically set up if you start to boot for the first time. it can not be switched, just removed. change nothing about this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositions filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional and add a tabulator (decimalcode 8) to the Statutes (Tabulatory signia will be automatically removed from the text). note that the default layout filter is being accessed.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-Filter will never be applied to & kde; -messages (rewind), warnings, messages or output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from Versions the normal layout of the borderment filter, you can insert it again by loading the default file default _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the map selection speech, you can write the speaker settings for the application. the map list is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard Speaker (the topmost on the map parameter speakers). in other words, there will be no interpersonal properties.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable controller which shows all properties of an equipped speaker. if you choose not delete or edit the settings of the speaker. if you choose the settings of the speaker. otherwise, selected spokesman; the speaker, the speaker, the most likely developed properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method for entering the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired language. if this property does not matter a role, you do not give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Highlight this command line when the property should have priority prior to other properties. you can also put several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Because the language is a critical factor in which the issue is, it is always treated as a priority property. you'll want to use this property rarely. the only case in which you possibly need to specify the attribute language, if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than that is provided in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the subject, the most adversed of the following is to be extinguished, click on the selection of standard speakers and then use the speaker, which corresponds to the above mentioned below.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number (no order number is required 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have debug, but I don't get any refund.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and weekts; it is likely that you have to register your Streamer 0.8.x is the command GST registers. if the problem is not solved by GST registers, it is potentially a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio-presentation over ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktay; one. on the & console; appears a message that says: the to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts at ALSA may occur that prevent the multi-time opening of multiple PCM devices. notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA Project (dmix) below www.alsa-project.org.</seg>

<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware is not able to install. physical equipment and its drivers have to already be functional and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the unit at all indicates and the adjustment of the network properties are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed at the Install of & Linux; installed and installed. network devices are added later, the drivers have to be loaded by adapting the files, according to the core version.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The module network will be loaded if the option network settings is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -index is selected. at the starring of the module network, this, the platform used in the system automatically detect.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the suspension is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release date can be best taken. by flagging the setting no-again, this selection will automatically be reprinted.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in the system petrol mode. previously, all options are grey, what meaning, the settings can only be considered. in the system administration, click on the right lower end of the module. it is required by entering the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three Reiter:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices will be displayed. from the tab network interface, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The set-up network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click of the button which is set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click of the snapshot of the button shows the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Using Automatisch the TCP / IP settings are obtained from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in the automatic mode the TCP / IP settings for the system will be completed with the start of system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends the required TCP / IP information at each system start, therefore no further adjustment can be required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP are selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection of Manuell can be made without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnetwork mask is defined.</seg>

<seg id="2834">The installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm-package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used by graphically surface such as kpackage or the installation tool for its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case the installation is Qt and & kde; it does not, but in addition, the development partnership with libraries and other things are required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology is given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix there is only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (do-home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found great spread. by IPv6, it is expected to penetrate the spread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge which address the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; workplace is the networkstation, which is applicable a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can be not simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a private small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specially trained for this purpose, to avoid IP addresses with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore, any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a creeways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks are mostly used for addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is big for networks to 250 computers large enough.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the network mask is usually put on 255.255.255.0, so all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special items, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the Zweite die loopback-Adresse (localhost = your own calculator).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The web address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, configuration files which are affected by & knetworkconf; and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed by DSL-connections, so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections, another content is set to be defined there.</seg>

<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be involved by e-dat. this can be done on three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& chdat; Get the tape back and reads the pretension information of the gang. detects & keer; the prescribers on the tape does not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the bandindexfile using the band's content. this procedure extinguishes all the existing index files for this band. you can reproduce the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This offers a backup profile with the selected files and standard settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should be done. the list of secure files will be automatically updated according to the chosen field folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the folder, files listed under backup files, the file is stored on the same filesystem, such as the folder. folder, which are based on other filesystems. each entry is separated from tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup will be used, a snapshot file is saved. only the files are saved, which have since changed since then.</seg>

<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files is gt; and lt; lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the belt system (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-recursive variant of the bandname.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this attitude is active, transmitted & chdat. before the tape is integrated the command to drive to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing surgery can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, it tries to lock the draft; the dropping out in the belt system. perhaps this setting does not work with all your orders.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched, when solving the integration of & chdat; automatically thened the band. do not use this option with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option switched, try & knees; the hardest block size for the tape drives. not all drives support variable blockbucks. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must communicate the block size for your tape.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the gang. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The volume of these symbolise is inname: seconds, the inname of the full name of the system is, on which the volume has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds have passed since the time the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The Band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar files that can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar do release. even other tar versions should work, so long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system protocols. the program is available for inexperienced users, where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files. moreover, users allows quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is an simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for unexperienced users who don't know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users with quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files of certain programs are filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 comes & ksystemlog; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with whose help the single protocol lines of a protocol-file can easily filter and sort. the individual possibilities to sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & kscrew log; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol window, then you do not pop up with system folder windows, so you do not have a small message window, so you do not have access to system rollers. the protocol information is usually performed in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also filter the filtering, in order to filter on a selected criteria. the list of log lines is automatically changed, so that only a log file is displayed in the filter setting. in the default setting, the selection row is displayed only if in one of the columns the string of the filter is contained.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. select the string pattern of the filter thread, then select the column process, and carry out in addition into the filtering the name of a process, so points to you & ksystemlog; all protocol-lines which have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol information. protocol lines of level errors are shown with a showy color as a protocol-lines of the level indicator. the colored display of protocol-lines can be switched on-fold dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you wish to display only certain process (for example in the system protocatoll or in the cron protocol), this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filter spbar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can jump the option to move on new lines in the context menu of the main window, to view all the new protocol sets.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksoplog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open additional sub window and manage. once you have selected an window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own web site on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dort you will find more recent information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; find also in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named as named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V init is rapidly developing for the control of the program transmission while overdrive the system in the & Linux; world. this is because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init-binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could attempt a machine on System V init without a reinstall and re-format. therefore, you need to continue, that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV init also differs from the BSD init that configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sylit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot scripts. generally you need a script for any system service that you would like to boot up the system or when moving to another running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things such as settibles which only once started. such views belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should turn off from / etc / rc.e, if you need it. most systems also own this file, even if there is actually not much use for that. you can also want to run a rc.info / etc / rc.d if you want to perform something with the serial device.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different positions of the init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runner level is up / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the preset Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can execute (etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have got something consistently, then you come to fix it by running the system and run following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the right scripts? if you enter's ls in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you will find no real files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the script in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How would start and stop init really system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K includes, the script with the argument will be called. if it includes a S, the script is called with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way, machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, just httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc. running. in addition I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; start.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv;. it should not be very hard because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another foredevice is simple to not say trivial: just drag a entry in the field of disposable system services to one of the six rounds, to start it on that level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. this will not only take place if they draw an entry in the field of disposable system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are shifted, if you drag these into a new area. to select them on a new Runoff menu, you must specifically choose from the menu material or select in the target range -- even if the same entry has previously exists in the target area of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you have to edit the sorrow of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: presently there is no way to Restartment items which were cast into the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, running level 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor key to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone another entry into another round level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorrow number or the name of an entry manually, press the entry button to switch to the Properties dialog. connect the dialog by erected pressures the entry button to accept the changes, or press Esc to make the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of the loss of data, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets will be taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; restored. changes to presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln and now the machine will start properly again. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Type at the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in the single user-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runoff at a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for running out by runlevel X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit extra files in / etc. please read the details in the distribution process.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are started in these distributions are simplified the configuration for the proprietary insertions of this district, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution: please verify whether any configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply finish without a message when its configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; running-level varies from distribution to distribution, can be used even from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runtime, so that this manual can be inflicted.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made modifications, you have to save it. either you use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry storing in the menu file.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user interface and the user log list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user interface and group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are presented only if you have an extended system settings. only when you create space constraint (Quota) for users, will make individual settings on which you can make individual settings if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master.passwd such as BSD-Unixes are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card-card password will be published, if file passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD -Unices are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card map appears only, if for at least one invert filesystem space constraint (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable on the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change for each user parameters, where the space constraint in in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be customized for each filesystem individually. the current file system will be selected using the field file system with a lack of space constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card-card groups informs about the group members belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field primitives group. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by choosing them in the large box.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add to the user or group or select the toolbar by clicking the selected user or the selected group at the selected user.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO-boot manager to remove the boat password, remove the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
