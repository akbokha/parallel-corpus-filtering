although I had been visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me too .
my love for America is extremely big .
like many of my generation I have grown up with American films , American music has been writing to American music , American authors and playing their sport in place .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist for a American film journalist .
when 14 @-@ year old , I saw the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who covered with the help of Julia &apos;s Roberts as a Jura @-@ student , which covered the highest court course with judges , who were interested in meeting his interest .
I was caught .
free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , certainly everything else , it &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only reinforced .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , the variety is so inviting , that you can always be the one that you are and it &apos;s easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very fancy love cover about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most remarkable aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , as he is about with its Eng@@ dies .
he never keeps his mind behind the mountain , as it is so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and openly declar@@ es his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Latin , Af@@ ro@@ unders and women .
nevertheless people are responding to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can presidential elections , was the highest number of nomin@@ ate by the party of nomin@@ ate Candi@@ date .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans , who support this big@@ gie person , I asked me ?
I was able to get Tr@@ ump and his voters don &apos;t tune with the people I had seen during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist , the people from all over the world gather , a deeply believing man with whom I was able to enter@@ tain me about Islam and its past .
also , a tr@@ umps world@@ view does not match Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix Sun &quot; at stake .
Ha@@ ze intoler@@ ance also stands in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ l , who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then , there was Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise couns@@ el helped me much with my career .
these people and those by them em@@ bo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump removal his way to nomin@@ ate Republi@@ can candidates , they offered me a grip and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , the Presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people have been tun@@ ed for wearing , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to describe the Tr@@ ump voters as an rac@@ ist .
to arrange the people , told one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respectful and indicates an in@@ capacity to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
could it be that these voters , some of whom are white , have agreed for Tr@@ ump , because they would like to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed .
in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick which comm@@ enting the cru@@ el decision to raise a man who look with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m. ) . : so much like &quot; sitting of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; words of white in hon@@ oring to the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ pl@@ ash , what is like the great Van Jones , has exactly the killed that America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have , America means everyone .
for this country chose to be his president , twice the son of a ken@@ ed , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white America of America , and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole term of plur@@ alism .
in the Americas , after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruin , saying it .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a manifestation for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a voc@@ al change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr Khan .
the crowd answered with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ aring the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ ino had a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; answered them .
will A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; would someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he obtained an un@@ anim@@ ously and sound@@ ly &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; God is praised that Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is now p@@ ile country , said the message .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America .
and that breaks down my heart .

out of the misery of the stars : these Latin @-@ American children leave their love of music not through waste .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played at both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the fall
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby underground ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years , the La B@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) in the municipality : one of children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found an opportunity to overcome them with musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students is the main interest for the church of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the parish , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drugs abuse and ban@@ anas violence .
but after a random meeting , this changed after an acci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare g@@ limmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , says the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come out of school they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and play with sh@@ iny eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , ob@@ oe , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga .
music from Mül@@ l
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay , is located on instruments produced from re @-@ value waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for music instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the Rec@@ ycl@@ er under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the crash into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , fl@@ utes , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the gar@@ bage .
the re@@ pertoire draws classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ist and musician , the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura reminds us of the early days :
first it was very difficult , because we had no room to rehear@@ sals but we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children don &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
the changed as F@@ avi@@ o has been shown something that he never had seen before : one out of waste .
today there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments from recur@@ ring material and that is called The Rec@@ ycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) acts the musical performance by :
the world produces approximately one billion tonnes of tr@@ ash each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest people , like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay .
and turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le from ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the Orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis ,
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be used to combat illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that dom@@ ic@@ iled illegal fishing is fighting .
this article , written by Emma Bry@@ ce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has deliber@@ ately reported on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ release will be done within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices on the sharing of content .
in West Africa , at that time it was known that this ship already had been operated in Liber@@ ian waters illegal fishing and before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were therefore discussing here , and have little incl@@ ined to welcome a leg@@ eb@@ re@@ aker of this kind in their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ers , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles , mobil@@ ised swi@@ f@@ tly against the ship . they refuse to give him one of their har@@ b@@ ors and refuse to give him a fishing reserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refuse to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leit@@ ner meeting of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship of order and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch the fish there .
ultimately , it was also comp@@ elled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liber@@ ia , because of pill@@ age of the fishing stocks of the country .
at the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protects , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO stop illeg@@ ally illeg@@ ally ( Il@@ legal fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries , which then had driven the prime minister in their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries which are inter@@ connected and work together . they exchange information and stand each other at where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project ending illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project provides user @-@ friendly technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is per definition un@@ regulated : what is caught , is hidden because of it extremely difficult to absor@@ b . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
by the int@@ enti@@ onal dis@@ regard of existing legislation through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems can harm the illeg@@ itim@@ ate balance .
but while promotions against illegal fishing began through bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ dles and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with which information between individual countries cur@@ ved , so happen the actions nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
here , the individual countries can interact with each other for example a list of lists , news about dam@@ aging activities or details which one may have noticed or experienced during a long@@ term projection .
fish @-@ i follows the activities of ships also very attentive when they move at the open sea , through satellite frequencies .
this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships which fishing in bot@@ her@@ ed areas . also let themselves discover so dam@@ aging tre@@ ks - some such that suggest a ship to his p@@ ent fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such surveys may show whether the participating ships have a fish @-@ license , where they were on the road and may also whether they have a criminal off@@ ence .
countries which are against illegal fishing may refuse on the basis of such information then adop@@ ting such ships in their har@@ b@@ ours . what does the ships could not sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to numbers from pen@@ alties , as in case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial loss for the owner , which means the illegal fishing ran@@ ches no more financially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leit@@ ner Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and is also supported by car @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to get more estimated 20 million USD of lost sales back that will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i each year because of the illegal fishing , which penet@@ rate to the East African waters .
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing boats which attracts the region of commercial cat@@ ching from all over the world . beneath these also illegal fishing .
among these practices , among other actions , are like the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ enc@@ papers , listing of fant@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , the fishing of fishing species and the fish@@ eries in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they choose the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weaknesses of a no @-@ organised control system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a ship could be illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &quot; You dar@@ ed not walk my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kom@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal si@@ p@@ ole tries to close Mary @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption was FISH @-@ i involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has revealed criminal networks that had counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ed licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent ident@@ ities and it has tr@@ acked vessels and found .
due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority for the fight against crime , I can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that is helping with FISH @-@ i to detect ships more precise .

Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps the illegal ships meet that they like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and user @-@ friendly technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn on for example its automatic identi@@ fier systems , which they cannot be dispos@@ ed of satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information levels together . it should help using user @-@ i to find criminal vessels with greater precision .
a model programme
but I can actually influence fate @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations and have undoubtedly the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , thinks that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth launched a platform for Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed through the position of each ver@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run with which a global system allows persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only touched by crimin@@ als but also sc@@ are terri@@ fy .
ships that have been conf@@ isc@@ ated earlier without a license and hardly reck@@ oned with consequences , they now know that they will be observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries involved in FISH @-@ i countries have now a 33 % increase in fishing approach , since fishing boats for more licenses .
after I had helped Somalia , Gre@@ ko 1 , and found the inspec@@ tors there abo@@ ard those dr@@ ags there , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; also other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is quite strongly that we now copy other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . now they are now fighting illegal fishing , depending on the same model as user @-@ i@@ . &apos; With security , the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently I could report the youngest member state in Somalia with his first major tri@@ umph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under the wrong flag . and not only was the ship used without a license , and they were now banned , meanwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking place of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set the strong signal that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a particular , collabor@@ ative working methods to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world ocean .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fier@@ ce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the French president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - including in the district of Bar@@ inas , in the regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , located in the central North of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva Esp@@ arta .

many representatives of the opposition saw the revival of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance for a fundamental change ; but ultimately , a re @-@ election of a re @-@ election was blocked from the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , takes it in its latest article as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the infl@@ ation@@ ary and greenh@@ ouses are highly valued at 500 % ( inflation rate ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching shortage of foods and medicine , the referendum was considered as the only way to reg@@ ain his institutional structures and to tap into a new government network .

particularly big waves beat the news of polished oppression in the central @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed def@@ ences of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country some protest@@ ers un@@ covered the police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry out tubes because otherwise they could not see something that many nation @-@ men do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ eri@@ or is already doing the round , which forms the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had question@@ ed the validity of the demand for an am@@ t@@ sen@@ ess procedure - this has now been demonstrated in the eyes of many thanks to the presence of countless people on the street .

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentin@@ ian city Córdoba , participated .
as a now adult male , Qui@@ j@@ ano was now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
started with the Bür@@ de , the same names as his father carry up to the brutal military per@@ med@@ itations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
34 years later , he kept the mar@@ y@@ hood for itself .
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret .
as child with 15 years one does not remember that one will manipul@@ ate from his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , more than a mur@@ derer .
Luis did not have a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a period of state treas@@ ury since 1974 to 1983 , a time of State r@@ or@@ ism , was his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Commander of Intelligence in the prison La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , who is charged with kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent on his child and how this child has chosen a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had friends with a guy who made mar@@ ti@@ al arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black @-@ white picture and demanded me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an arti@@ ch@@ ole , you have friends with some of the ERP @-@ friends .
pass only means that they will not have you one day , and I must save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revolu@@ cion@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - revolution@@ aries &apos;s army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; parties in Argentina .
therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become any secret .
I was 15 years old and I thought in that situation I thought it would be fine . for so my dad had raised me .
on the military base , I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda model , books , simply everything .

my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first time and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he command@@ ed me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refrigerator , simply everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small into a ceiling tile and command@@ ed me to wear it for the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ot of silver .
on that day , I went to the other end of Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were dropped and talked to a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ elled and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on the humans .
it looked like a cri@@ b and metal springs .
later I found out that it fortified the end of a cab@@ al . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just cap@@ tiv@@ ated there .
they rarely play a person with towels on the bed , p@@ oured him with water and hunt him a load of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the st@@ ench there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty we@@ del .
years later , when my father was under house ar@@ rest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I wonder@@ ed : how is it possible that a person can do with another so much sor@@ row ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed . &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra , the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tiv@@ ated and they were cap@@ sul@@ ated .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilians who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses , on which naked people were cap@@ tiv@@ ated with the face down - all were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance col@@ au@@ ded people still stand on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is you looking so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I left &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why hast thou otherwise brought ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and was buried and buried of soldiers .
I know this , because my Father told me at home .
apart from La cu@@ ad@@ ra there were some rooms which were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito , &quot; Rom@@ ero there sm@@ ote a man and sle@@ w .
( after details of survi@@ vor@@ s the civil war , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial was charged with the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .

the road you came in here is also the way to which the came here came here .
when looking at the map , see that they took about this route and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of the de@@ human@@ ization number assigned .
if they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above , that they should be displ@@ aced .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ ms - for the deport@@ ation of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war Resi@@ stance &apos;
my father brought all possible things stolen from home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later in the military - I was in the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war @-@ mare , a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military bad@@ ges that one gets lost in an enemy which is fought for .

but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... sti@@ pul@@ ates , then that is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked me how my Father , who could join the security forces at this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply do not understand it .
I was also officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crimin@@ als and I rep@@ lied , and you , that you feel most cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded W@@ ut , struck me and cr@@ ying :
if you go that far , then I will find you and bring you own stran@@ ger .
we need no one else !
so was my father .
I have no only good memory of it .
when I said in the trial , I showed a picture of that back then , on which I had a jacket and a wheelchair swe@@ aters from Wol@@ le . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with his home .
at that time I accused the defence , a co @-@ conspir@@ ators with this crime . I dis@@ agree , no problem they can give me a burden on what they wanted .
I was still there , so to speak .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , one sees the value of a life .
one develops more and det@@ ects that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have so done so during the dictatorship of Man . but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children manage ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - that this was a little girl .
I always asked me the question : they were tor@@ tured but why were they killed ?
they could just put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these men . but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
had these people not even families whom you could pass their imm@@ ort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act of man to do .
my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the imm@@ ort@@ al rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were un@@ orted and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something of course remains always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to get it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even was with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my dad .
the thought , to view my father was made during a conversation , when it was under house ar@@ rest .
I made him stran@@ ded because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience in@@ vari@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt bot@@ her@@ ed in@@ war@@ dly and asked me what the whole survi@@ ving patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they alle@@ ged@@ ly defended themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ ed :
how can you tell me what to tell ?
I have seen how you killed people !
there are horri@@ ble crimes committed and you forced me to participate as a child to participate .
he we@@ ed only &quot; Na then forgive me however . &quot;
just that did me .
2010 first att@@ ed the first ad .
I finally knew that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can throw in that I am pres@@ et . I finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the sign with the translation errors in Kyoto , in which one can extend its leader .
the photo was spread in the social media .
edited of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ claim its leader , in the last month witness a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that it may also be translated with mal@@ icious bed &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1st to 20th September , electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
execution of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often divided into social media .
the error was the transl@@ ator Julian Hol@@ mes , a residents of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local time @-@ time attentive .
the newspaper Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; H@@ enny &quot; ( German : &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropri@@ ately @-@ correct term &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; ) .
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture did not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the transl@@ ator and that the translation is not checked for their correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry to have felt older people through the insufficient correction ( the translation ) in our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set up a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ oun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ cyclists who are involved in accidents , but definitely cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 Un@@ sei@@ zu@@ res of Sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors sen@@ iors 18@@ 03 from a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
so the share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of those caused by sen@@ iors in the same period has risen .
the named re@@ porter , in the published version of article comments in the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to be opposed to older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among other things received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ght@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; so is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
transmission errors are widespread in Japan and in Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true fund@@ ament for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
over time , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the initial text and to active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native language . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators is in the target language - not in the language language - native language should be .
for example , a French mother tongue , for instance , was transl@@ ating from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as native language , the translations into English . this may sound at fault @-@ understanding for the over@@ set , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers , to learn Japanese .
some companies that even have no foreign employees , don &apos;t make use of company internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is app@@ raised to the one transl@@ ator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
the s@@ wor@@ r@@ ene and r@@ aked phr@@ ases , which can be made by machine translation , show that this technology cannot replace no human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages quite particularly .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints which often decor@@ ate T @-@ shirts or po@@ ckets are used only for st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not to be read or not understood at all .
photo of Flick@@ r @-@ User Joseph Br@@ ent .
transmission errors do like jewelry still acceptable or , at least harmless . but from large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations .
the city Kyoto continues to use a serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and counter@@ measures taken on the Internet and on television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ensa y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for press and society ) .
on Friday morning , 7th of April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users , that they do not have access to an online @-@ channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , others wrote that the internet pres@@ sions of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV will be no longer available .
other online transm@@ itter @-@ transm@@ it@@ ated photographs of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by op@@ positions groups , which res@@ ist the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started at the beginning of April , after the colon@@ el court dis@@ solved the Parliament and had the role of the parliament transferred to the executive and the captain himself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author with Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ out@@ es . he pointed out that the connection was cr@@ app@@ ed , and recommended the U@@ sers , V@@ PN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your V@@ PN .
it seems that Internet site Venezu@@ el@@ an@@ an Provider are again closed .
it is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ ti@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been with reporting protests in the past 2014 . at that time , the Commission suffered for telecommunic@@ ations to them with money and aud@@ ition@@ ers when they continue to report on the demonstrations , since the Commission looked this as a call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly that it is more favourable to buy than two lit@@ ers of Lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay has been in@@ accessible through a blocking of Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more on @-@ line transm@@ itter . this also affects the website , which the National Assembly has over its meetings .
previous research inquiries made by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had demonstrated that the local internet provider sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNA servers will respond to certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server does not fail or deny the request during the call of such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transfer on Thursday , April 6th , was set , when the V@@ PI@@ TV Cam@@ am@@ ann El@@ vis Flores , brought live to the protests in Car@@ acas .
Flores has been be@@ aten while he was at police .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the Government will regulate the Internet connections : hence the Venezu@@ el@@ ans the access to multi@@ medi@@ al coverage of the current events in the country is becoming increasingly difficult .
in Paraguay many girls will become slaves to get an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was a child a Cri@@ me . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina for the Rights of Children and colle@@ cts a witness of other Cri@@ me who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo of Cec@@ ilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of c@@ tural .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report by Kur@@ tural , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; V@@ acas que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga lived eight years in a household , in which she was not married together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house again and heard that the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
the , out of which something has become , &quot; she said .
but Tina Al@@ var@@ enga has never been treated as a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as cri@@ d@@ ita for the family . as a Cri@@ me , in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money there is their min@@ der son or her min@@ de@@ ous daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned yet is that the children must afford a lot of days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of an agreement you cannot rise .
this practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ is was widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing their studies Al@@ var@@ enga previously worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
in doing so , she spoke to Cri@@ me - especially young girls , who are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ is - raised a witness , resear@@ ched and p@@ ran@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the sensation of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated , guaranteed in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ is is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ enga .
on the one hand , she is the family who im@@ pose her daughter in the belief that she pre@@ di@@ ct so her education to improve their position in society and to do something out of himself , to another family .
on the other hand , the family is taking up the girl with himself and whose exploitation just@@ i@@ fies with faith that they would give someone a chance , which otherwise would not have received training and perhaps even be star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl becomes mist@@ aken , his family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they even never know of them .
in January 2016 , this has so far been relatively un@@ familiar phenomenon , that is held in al@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
as Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy b@@ lows . shortly there@@ on , she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ m@@ ita in the household of the former military authority Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , which works as an official at the local community .
Mar@@ ín was living in their house in V@@ aqu@@ ería , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of a young girl .
some days later the media commented on the incident .
they stressed that the killed child was a cri@@ cket .
organisations like UNIC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made a deep responsibility for the death of the girl in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Gesellschaft .
they signi@@ fied the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and demanded that there will be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children registered , &quot; compl@@ ained Tina Al@@ var@@ enga .
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of married and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a fine investigation of the case .
they want to be Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ ad@@ ita sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case of judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be tr@@ end@@ setting - when the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
the everyday life of a cri@@ cket
cri@@ mp are exploited not only as labour @-@ exploited , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ enga was ten years old when the colour@@ ful , in which her father worked , con@@ course , and her father lost his work .
all the brothers had to work all and began to sell on the street or in the sweets shop to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as cri@@ d@@ ita in the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ enga worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , she had to share the time that you still stayed longer time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days for example clean@@ se it the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ fied the floor .
when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employer .
Al@@ var@@ enga says , she had never had hungry , but was also not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the landlord &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; it reminds of them .
the library was well equipped and was assigned to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , which was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some evenings of land@@ owners Al@@ var@@ enga , next to him stand and editorial made of leaders such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
he held it for intelligent , but did not substanti@@ ate with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke about politics while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they granted me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would get there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; with that they heard that Al@@ var@@ enga , that belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ ana , at home their native language Guar@@ an@@ í would speak .
her Lord feared that she had the formation they had made it to lose again , they explained .
but you were fully aware that they had paid for everything she had from them to get paid with hard work .
even at school Al@@ var@@ enga is discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never spoken , Mob@@ bing and the sham@@ ans are exposed to those Cri@@ mp@@ s , when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that somebody who has no parents to have a cri@@ d@@ ita .
I could not invite anyone to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly distinc@@ tly that I was not part of a group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ enga .
the company sees the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can have a job for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the administr@@ ators of the group is PE@@ PA Kost@@ ian@@ ov@@ sky , a town@@ house in the district As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and afternoon with her .
to learn .
please call you .
start from Monday , if possible .
the display was given five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , which also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 years old baby . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the country inner which I want to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then there was once again the editor of the ad used again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with it .
thank you , I write again when something is .

in the course of our history we managed to manage systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the Spanish conquest , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í ) and the System of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers act as Hal@@ b slaves ) , and the System of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers act as a semi @-@ slaves ) , so that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery in which they become easy victim of abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and the face of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ me .
A@@ stri@@ d is writing by the Egyptian users in social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliamentary vote have recently agreed to a draft law &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use and conditions of social networking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is adopted by Parliament , users must register their users and users in Egypt for a governmental authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up , which is charged with citizens and to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register their users and users on the site with its real names and recru@@ its numbers to take advantage of social networks .
if it is failed to do so , this could bring a penalty up to six months in prison or a money rep@@ ent@@ ance .
the bill that consists of six parameters , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs through the internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video agate and text . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when the draft can be imposed on how Egyptian authorities should be imposed on users and users &quot; registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ clear is , as they should do not register with the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Spe@@ aker for Member States and sponsors , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a us@@ ername and password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get by the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that could mean Egypt is planning to provide a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans are .
experts and experts on site are skep@@ tical regarding the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leit@@ ner researchers &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly in the technical capacities and understanding , neither authority in Egypt with regard to things that do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could control by force physical public and private spaces online .
if I take it seriously it means that they will implement a strong surveillance system to filter citizens or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to as@@ sign them to a court process .
that is technically in no way realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure of the parliament and the constitutional committees , before it enters the deb@@ ating debate .
whether its acceptance and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , where control is to be maxim@@ ised and ensure that no dis@@ cord is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year the Spe@@ aker &apos;s Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a law@@ suit against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime , which were found guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of the Iraq region , the Tier@@ Sch@@ ütz@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists in the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the wit@@ ty Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of Leopard , who runs through Africa and Asia , belonging to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus Hun@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always found less prey , at risk .
why is this particular kind of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard shows the only remaining beast of the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends that a large beast of prey is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video provides that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera all , R@@ aza is breaking in pure joy .
as a well @-@ educated Biolog@@ ine , R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately shows a different side of their country that is not just war and conflict .
she has been involved in research studies at wild living animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to making water zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

in early March 2017 , which were documented for the Nor@@ theast Japan , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; Tri@@ une disaster &quot; from March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima had triggered the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a former pre@@ f@@ ecture of Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring countries of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced mar@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
to this end , Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima also experienced a nuclear accident , already alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o is seen from a local point of view that advances in the six years , to rebuild the lives of local resident .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and the survey results of those concerned themselves .
the housing situation in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that as far as December 2015 , has a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement farm ( the same extends , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ish@@ ads .
the biggest success among the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures could record Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 per cent of the planned sub@@ sides were finished .
I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima is with 70 percent the final light .
however , one still has to try again , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ ind , the cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final sub@@ centers .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
almost 40 percent of gradu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima still live in emergency accommodation , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in emer@@ gen@@ cies , more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated who have been reduced after the disaster in containers , were transformed into final houses .
the number is 34 per cent for I@@ w@@ ate .
the state of works and everyday life in the three affected Pre@@ f@@ ecture
how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper could determine at 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the un@@ happiness to re @-@ establish its doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is much more difficult for industrial reconstruction in the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation at Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima only 30 percent of fish@@ eries ports in their operation .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident occurred in the three Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Agro@@ land large in compassion .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , whereby only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed A@@ cker@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic process , since only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed A@@ cker@@ land of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , lie in the &quot; nuclear war zone . &quot;
in two of the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism had gone back again to recover , but here Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima remains far down@@ cast .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level , as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima can be found here only 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal population lives , it seemed to be more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to establish a total picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys by the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated by . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how her sensation around the ts@@ un@@ ami has changed .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native people of experience .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident , measures have taken to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ amis .
however , 55.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in the matter of disasters prevention has been done .
as it comes to those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima
in their edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also strength@@ ens its attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima .
Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima was also witn@@ essing the worst , disaster caused , atom@@ y in@@ if , which Japan had ever had to experience .
from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people were re@@ structured back to Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima , in permanent replacement @-@ houses .
after the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima off their home country pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the Kat@@ ast@@ ro@@ phen@@ ols most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated areas are most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated , who still have to reg@@ ained in correct homes , because efforts need to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a matter of construction projects , which are part of the Olympic Games to take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , you often see that a more connecting than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important because they demand our prejudi@@ ces to bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at precisely these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with subjects that often gain less attention when they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man , like the love of music has consolidated the lack of shared language knowledge ; Adriana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when they worked with people from all over the world . and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences , which he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

an Brasi@@ lian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into intensive care : last Friday he had struck him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a drum set aside . however , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ shepherd and several frac@@ tures .
doctors made him this Saturday and now have translated him into an artificial coma .
his state is considered to be critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures also the face of the police force to recognize that is identified with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident gave the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident had been suspended from the active service .
the pictures show the police depic@@ ted as he introduced in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his drum to the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police design@@ ate from a protest@@ ers and would land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months in television and the whole oppression would justify this .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; an press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided the images of Lu@@ iz da Luz , where one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by police police and several par@@ am@@ edic briefly to hur@@ ry .
another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is fil@@ med in social media .
in the clip below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , living in another federal state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans Re@@ ais ( about 2,500 euros ) to cover part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be cour@@ ageous , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Center of Ort@@ ell@@ ado : further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ met@@ ered Irish supported by his father , because he was a very sad fall of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira , and here was the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was on the intensive care station , after he was attacked by some police officers who has be@@ aten it with a drum .
police re@@ gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where last Friday came with brutal attacks against demonstr@@ ators .
polic@@ emen continued during protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ an , rubber and com@@ bust@@ ling .
the representative of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via tel@@ ev@@ oke to reno@@ un@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this also includes a report in fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again the Brazilian media street prot@@ ector ver@@ tu@@ ated by focusing on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window @-@ board .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted over a cr@@ ush glass window in order to render to a photo their tit@@ avi@@ ary illustrations .
in contrast , the O Glo@@ bo preferred a title story with a set @-@ up plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reasons to report more about a broken semen than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defence of a particular subject . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also recognise , if strictly against any kind of state damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of violence will be crus@@ hed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on confrontation with the police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of the un@@ in@@ duced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar be@@ factories in all of Cuba were closed ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a ) .
the Volks@@ gemein@@ de Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish Bu@@ mill - regardless of its fact that there are no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar be@@ ware on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in sugar be@@ ots fabri@@ c@@ ated .
after gradu@@ ation , the sugar be@@ ech industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete was left .
around 272 workers were forced to inv@@ ent themselves .
some are rarely the work .
others re@@ signed and swing daily with the factories that are still mah@@ len .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar@@ be@@ hr@@ industry do not smoke its sleep .
he cons@@ ented to be in the east of the region of sugar be@@ fabri@@ ken , who are in operation after a long period of time because they were received .
that was something he was not expecting .
N@@ ene is remin@@ is@@ cent of having heard precisely that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would become the sugar be@@ hr@@ fabrik , but the promise was not held .
the sugar@@ be@@ men already resi@@ sted the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country some decades ago , but the bad days are not a new one .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar@@ be@@ an industry ?
the old railway station of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the reduction of the sugar be@@ ech industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar be@@ fabri@@ ken were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive , they became unbe@@ atable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient manufacturing , the annual production target amo@@ unted to 4 million tons .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0,@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives , which resulted in such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price increased about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report , &quot; agricultural economic &quot; of the OECD and FA@@ O , the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tons ) , the raw sugar export would be approximately 85 million dollars for the land .
not everything went well
&quot; the day of today will come into history with certainty in history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
during the following years there was a total of 98 sugar be@@ factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar@@ be@@ hr@@ fabrik Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked since 1967 in the factory .
when N@@ ene , as it is known as a soldier , about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
thus the place will receive , they set a full time - working group .
before the first lap years , the first letters began to come .
it was officially lab@@ eled documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could dism@@ iss any claim .
from there the responsibility was over@@ taken and the letters come more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the breast@@ feeding factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &apos; the land had no money for the plant still in operation .
Eddy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the feeding of the factory in whose construction he helped .
with each part he depart@@ ed , dism@@ ant@@ led one of his 31 work@@ years .
the industry developed by Cuba and more important work producers has been er@@ ased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that generated plants in the communities where they found themselves , created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President indicated in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas , whose factories is no longer in operation for five years , everything would run smoothly .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar be@@ ads
since 2004 sugar cane is extrac@@ ted only high through the deposit .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
after two years , the People community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar stret@@ chers joined , or better said than they started to dis@@ connect them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced old , N@@ ene and Eddy other factories had been searching for .
you have been sent to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region even so many young people .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continues to be impos@@ ing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nine @-@ four appointments put the old soldiers a gro@@ ente from two @-@ day Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a self @-@ supporting person , yet he gives the lies , which one told him , not .
they have been tor@@ ment for ten years .
N@@ ene is in R@@ ente with 65 years , not because it lacks on strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young@@ sters use Hip Hop to express themselves and their own culture

youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with subjects that are important to them . they do they using Hip Hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour brings mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups son@@ g@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by teachers David Hod@@ ges who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Ireland with ten C@@ ree Communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip Hop @-@ Group The North@@ stars .
the workshop thus contributes to the participants in discussions such as &quot; cultural identity , language , discussion , love , self acceptance , &quot; or what they always come in mind .
these questions include inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of school &apos;@@ Na A@@ ks@@ a Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ um of First Nation in British Columbia , for example , the history of the highway 16 , also called &quot; highway of tears , &quot; at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or mur@@ dered .
the cases were largely un@@ resolved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the mot@@ if of a video games to communicate , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences through globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in Indi@@ genous languages , although the young people will not always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ sk@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has been made , the ref@@ rain on C@@ ree was sung .
the young people involved find some help from Gary Jol@@ ly of North@@ stars Hip Hop , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in Um@@ schrift , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in my care
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I try to continue my days on earth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the day you &apos;ll take our hor@@ ror
because we as youth lost our way to life
but I believe we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and serve as well as our youth
so they can do what they are dest@@ ined to be Creator
in the commentary box the reader and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also includes a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in si@@ lo@@ be ( which also will be published on his blog ) :
in Japan plastic dishes not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
to show the client what exactly is on the menu , are displayed close to the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin EC@@ pur@@ u ( a central flavor , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) from each speaker , which is served in this restaurant .
the customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that were documented by German film@@ makers Wim Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , plastic dishes are so usual that they are not even stri@@ ving once more . a new trend is turning it into show@@ y cell accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this un@@ common tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin .
now in special sale : new decorated with plastic dishes decorative mobile phones , as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have turned to kit@@ sch@@ y and harvest@@ ed items , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets .
here are a couple of sho@@ re@@ fr@@ y magn@@ ets for a new show in Tokyo &apos;s Tokyo .
the new boom of the foo@@ dies is becoming increasingly w@@ rest@@ ful .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell @-@ stand .
for this three @-@ sided bowl ( lol ) we have found a good use as a cell phone .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone stick :
designed to watch like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of a growing approach to the com@@ ic touch .
some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or sal@@ mon is used , a popular to@@ pping , served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s someone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can s@@ ect my mobile phone with sal@@ mon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the one .
this interest in plastic surgery can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our new mobile phone stand has the form of mel@@ ting ice .
in addition , there are also st@@ abling ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ yb@@ stand in dried sal@@ mon .
additional sk@@ ur@@ ts plastic dishes , you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the has@@ ht@@ ag # 219
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives an insight into the district of Capp@@ ab@@ ashi , giving an insight into the district of Capp@@ ella , which is dedicated to the supplies of the restaurant industry . such as the sho@@ ku@@ hin Pr@@ pur@@ u .

a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of foreign and foreign media above the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug trading &quot; in Mexico the mis@@ ses and fat@@ alities regularly emerge only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle with itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Car@@ z@@ m@@ án , made up the stories of the victims of the conflict just in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , barely anyone looking at the trau@@ ma or on the congreg@@ ations that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each cor@@ pse , behind every bone report in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories fo@@ rest@@ less parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wo@@ unds may never heal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico presents the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the drug trading process &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which aims to give these victims a voice and tells stories about people working in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cardboard boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if stores close , because they are threatened by drugs and whole congreg@@ ations must drive a lot of kilometers to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) relates precisely these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who married every weekend tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Rod@@ r@@ í@@ guez , who at only one day gave their father , their four brothers , their husband and two their ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task that we have put before , go and go to gra@@ ves after the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Contr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Contr@@ eras M@@ ata .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother who also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
you are in charge of your Father &apos;s insurance , but most of them does not pay off because those require a mort@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are worried . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk @-@ related areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico , this contribution made from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , regardless of which form it occurs :
disease and sensation of journ@@ alism have been known now for several years now .
I come over every day at times of time and see the tit@@ ties with images , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it takes me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as though I am the only one that is ad@@ orable or sad . it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once .
I cannot be equally valid or consider it to be normal .
it writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year c@@ ous@@ in thinks he wants the Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when it is great . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the off@@ ences , if they go through the streets .
for me that &apos;s like they were those of those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they also happen as something .
I see our weakness if stories about mere figures become within a stati@@ stic .
the in@@ sensitivity of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students are justified in a neigh@@ bou@@ red place so that they were &apos; modest &apos; .
I think they try to chat that they are spar@@ ed from such trag@@ e@@ dies if they are not st@@ ir and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution of &quot; four months of ext@@ or@@ tion in the main city district : like a family with dr@@ ills was squee@@ zed . &quot; in this she describes how armed crimes viol@@ ates from their business by the end not only the business was destroyed , but also their family have tor@@ n apart .
you think of everything you have lost and about how many people can change your whole life within a few days .
the pain over that never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the anxiety will be back high if you are alone .
habits have changed , telephone numbers also changed .
we just contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will lead you or kill you .
I wonder@@ ed in these terrible days if cr@@ ying out my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how to cr@@ ying . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence marked . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a mis@@ missed lady and a man who was killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in one settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of her .
Br@@ yan is a f@@ ade and he tells himself that he cook@@ s yourself how to cook a egg , Pot@@ til@@ las , Tor@@ til@@ las , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies . this is his name for the preparation of the flo@@ cks with water , sugar and milk powder .
he relates to the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he said that his mother disappeared .
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years ago , when he removed just a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father was shot by armed men from a driving car .
as Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked as follows :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez has the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of persons according to the Board of Directors for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the amount of 8,5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just some hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves organised crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the into the soul of the country .
few stories are living beyond always new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not forgotten .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vivi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Anim@@ al Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 explained the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to exhibit the complex information behind the clever struggle against drug dealers , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in intelli@@ gible way .
when one image is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flick@@ r @-@ User Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages that he is linked , contain images where violence is shown .
the fact check is important in a moment where it is about up@@ lift up a rum@@ or or to un@@ cover a f@@ ake .
but what is the years after being done for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR@@ C ) .
since its first release , it was used to con@@ fine trag@@ e@@ dies , trag@@ e@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false p@@ airing of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it also raises questions about our desire for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a pet@@ rol carriage over@@ took the place S@@ ange in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ l and explo@@ ded . at the same time , 230 people came to life .
after the civil war in Africa the two @-@ biggest country had been neglected and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous p@@ ents full of stroke , which were difficult to sail .
typically , the gas bu@@ ggy fell victim to the victim .
administration representatives described a fire@@ ball , the twi@@ sting homes including a cin@@ emas in the vicinity , which was full of people who see the world championship Championship .
houses le@@ wi@@ red and un@@ covered cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the faul@@ ty .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Myst@@ ical Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen body that are open onto the ground while people look at it .
but history is not in its end .
over the years , the same picture has been dis@@ solved several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but may not be attributed to the related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the S@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the command@@ ing Nig@@ eri@@ an villages B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ st@@ ically by atro@@ cities , before which they had to fle@@ e .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a population of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were destroyed , were shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images could be represented at the following time .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the arm@@ rests in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am in the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture taken back from the Democratic Republic of the Congo when it was mis@@ diagnosed as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
an Mass@@ ac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is only one in a number of fail@@ ures ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was taken as a test@@ ament to mass k@@ ill@@ ings .
yet another step further , personal comments like this example saw the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to deliver arguments .
the picture of his rod also appeared in connection with the deadly prosec@@ ution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , the ones who were able to fle@@ e , rape and et@@ ch@@ art@@ ing dead , some by burning .
while others reported from the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Post@@ s like the following , descri@@ bing this description with photographs from the Democratic Republic of the Congo :
this picture is from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news . in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein may have said that mon@@ ks and politicians have been involved in the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo to con@@ fine this information .
the original contribution , which was last updated on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations who have named AF@@ P as their source were also mist@@ aken Th@@ ein may have attributed this statement , but had not brought the picture from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false cou@@ pling record will go back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converted picture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image , one can see how far more limitations can be crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine Tin@@ an has found 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found that the said image from the Democratic Republic of the Congo are very similar .
they date from a mis@@ concep@@ tu@@ ous private pages , platforms in social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , others have tried others to un@@ masks the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ers .
we have defined examples for the mis@@ used usage and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they were published , and thus we want to be more clearly defined by the language .
from the countries below ( which in some cases were inter@@ connected ) several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases which now can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) :

the orph@@ an@@ ised countries indicate pages or server , over the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ s@@ ings are still available .

as the memory , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , the mut@@ u@@ ci@@ ble in the name of Islam , even greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ed as a test@@ er for the mass@@ ac@@ re of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times for we@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it were taken up in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to attract attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media reporting relevant to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was alle@@ ged@@ ly written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an mass@@ ac@@ re , in circulation , there will take a discussion just like this here in Vietnamese , and explained it to the Fal@@ se .
from the emb@@ assy in which the picture was included in the Democratic Republic of Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are more confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , ag@@ greg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) , ink indicates , but are no longer fully re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time @-@ tim@@ est@@ amp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and compile them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original un@@ spoiled by 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description but the original contribution is not available or appro@@ achable .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) here , which make this Post@@ s under@@ go . the first frame foc@@ uss@@ ed on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in relation to the murder of Christians by Muslims or in defense of Muslims - the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value human life is both important to both . therefore , it is worth to examine how pictures are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper issue is what happens if readers cannot give these pictures longer faith .
with social media , there are tens of people who acci@@ dental have their interest in practice water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ aware and nar@@ row@@ ed it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of rolled images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the with@@ hold of images of an ref@@ us@@ al to acknowledge the tragedy . at times these images are even being demanded by the victims itself .
at the same time , the worry that non @-@ violent images and viewers will des@@ ens@@ iti@@ ze and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who sought to work as non @-@ violent media to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with the violent represent@@ ations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reports .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog is revealed the uniqu@@ eness of the smaller languages
Photo@@ photo@@ graphic of Andy Simm@@ ons is using CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . irre@@ plac@@ eable ) attempts to offer a choice of words from all over the world who are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are available in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ translated words are already well known today ( as the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all res@@ ist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists talk Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Tyler decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog you can find example words from the German Tax @-@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Ben@@ em@@ h you to know your parents regarding how to strive for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that makes one feels after cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his Blog About :
they s@@ worn other cultures , reve@@ aling other thought @-@ cat@@ ches and wake up our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we want to analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the Lingu@@ ist@@ ics on this site would like to publish more of this &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ asure Langu@@ ages , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to re@@ charge their favourite sw@@ amp@@ ant here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is moving with the worst flav@@ ours of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently in the worst high water and cat@@ astrop@@ hic flood in this decade .
triggered by Mon@@ sun , who usually ends in late May , are by strong ra@@ inf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement from the cat@@ astrop@@ hic center of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are inter@@ ming@@ led because of the flo@@ ods and mud .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected by about 400 000 people since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been brought to 304 cru@@ ises .
the rains left on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water conditions in some areas were slowly coming back .
health and hygien@@ ists of the population is a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give a impression of the extent of the disaster :
flo@@ ods in Ta@@ wooded city with water intervals of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as Azz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et regular updates on the high water supply .
many use the has@@ ht@@ ag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka fatal flu@@ kes , the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ che crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after further rains are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ag@@ oda at G@@ alle also flood@@ ed because of the last flood@@ ed water@@ p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ oda E@@ la .
the Air Force has five planes for rescue operations and other five are made for shipment of emergency pan@@ ies for those in their flood@@ ed villages .
even several organizations and start @-@ ups have prepared to help .
Facebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue missions Dro@@ h@@ ears need for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .

the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , resident in need for security and provide guidance .
this has prevented the loss of another human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .

use Acc@@ ord@@ ing Dam@@ as in January I took part at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neigh@@ bor and love girlfriend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter , she is familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the Bran@@ dung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we still call for Par@@ ole for the rights of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next step we are rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from a US flag , other sk@@ an@@ cies of Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend watching me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslim &quot; who built himself in her imagination .
you escape me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we pract@@ ise our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim but to different kind . but somehow we all get into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer , in our collective imagination , is so well designed that as soon as Muslims as I do not fit , escape .
to be de@@ pressed
I stand not alone with it alone .
this is done even to the poet , whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i .
which images do you come in mind , if you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as a shut@@ ters , Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a orthodo@@ x@@ er muscle and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Cor@@ an , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western vision , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1,7 billion Muslims in this world .
another argument exists in the symbol@@ istic paintings by Muslims , the Western books have been colonial for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark guy who should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the Norwegian Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ red in the 19@@ 70s the story behind these pictures .
but these images are also prot@@ ru@@ sted today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continued to continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , f@@ law@@ ful fo@@ ols domin@@ ate our news@@ letters .
this sh@@ ad@@ mitt@@ edly sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality which in the last three decades have led to nine Muslim women to choose their countries , while the US has not even nomin@@ ate their first female presidential candidates .
this scar@@ ring fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are har@@ dened in it , to wear head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings and cover s@@ our Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that are both two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercise his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers on American floors were spoken by Afri@@ kan@@ ers who were so called with slave @-@ ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ ative has ra@@ ined our collective imagination of so deep and incorrect that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children will become the aim of anti @-@ tim@@ ental attacks and sever@@ ance .
because of those stories we tell and about the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
1.7 to the 1,7 billion
in the news industry we are doing more than just stories to tell , based on facts .
or upon alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the nar@@ ration of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed where seven million Muslims share the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant &apos;s parents were in New York to live their American dream .

at that time when Khan had again thought out of the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ w@@ wo@@ unds Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ conscious Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask people why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say instead of my Muslim prescription , or I mean my hand@@ some pocket , which all Muslims contribute to themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze , we do not wear all T@@ ash@@ ore with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or by almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of Muslim Muslim schol@@ ar , Muslim activists and cross @-@ religious activists who try to fight for widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced at the ongoing volume of a well @-@ engine@@ ered Islam@@ ism , with w@@ ills , thy@@ me tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and about the way in which we tell them , Islamic fundament@@ alism is in more than just a fore@@ igner , who creates the head@@ scar@@ f .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if social @-@ ists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my fier@@ ce in the Bran@@ dung , I &apos;m glad that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses .
it would look like an all @-@ end ritual with my daughter , if I saw them in my arms , and enter the Arab verses for the protection of whis@@ per@@ ing that popul@@ ate the grain and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rati@@ fication of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reduced length &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all muscle children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch structural Islam@@ ization .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registr@@ ations which started with President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration policy , which takes a five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries which are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a wrong and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which largely Arabs and Muslims took into the Vis@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bom@@ bs which we throw at Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we are not telling , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically real picture and b@@ ade them to assess groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .

the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to carry out
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep in addressing the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to realize the roots of our fears and inf@@ ect the faul@@ ty and dangerous expression that we ste@@ ered in our message editorial .
at least , there is an increasing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to grasp our many interpret with legs and forgotten history .

but I am concerned because of this difficult global point in which we are in .
and that moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1,7 billion .
there is one reason that conspir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ist , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they made Muslims from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by having created the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years previously , they had not yet given them ; now they domin@@ ate great regions in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware I was as old as I was my daughter , but who now made me become an unknown Muslim .
things which I have left here like a bread @-@ scratch in my speech .
things , which might ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the interactions formed by our humanity , a story may lau@@ ern , where one is made to another . &quot;

why would I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being fought and people in public opinion , four decades had been a researcher at Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being aware and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; as it did me , because the employment that we have a new future , in which we have no president , who is already broken lands and &quot; to other &quot; people bom@@ bing , go far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins with all of us .
initiative of narr@@ ative wants to preserve urban diversity
story telling , Flick@@ r @-@ User Daniele Rossi , under the use of the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be an opportunity to get in touch with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Tyler and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Tre@@ asure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) the identification of stories in their original language is a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative from Steven Bird , the un@@ mistak@@ able blog .
here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written reference , but on the spoken word . this is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language variety of major cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already implemented since 2015 , the risk that little and not quite as small languages are not passed on to those born children .
for the creators of the project are :
the ne@@ quin of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities to eliminate the diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not forget who they are , in order to be de@@ part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often listen to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ uses these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to estimate , to feel up@@ tu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format we present their story first in their own language and translate them into English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devot@@ ion and representation makes it possible to take the audi@@ ences there@@ after .
they both give laughter and emotions than a barrier is no longer a barrier .
the following video presents a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller rac@@ tor rac@@ ou shows also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of stor@@ yt@@ art .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the pump in the language Sh@@ ona from Zim@@ babwe :
after explaining the importance of his beak , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how did you speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide dit@@ ch he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
you were totally with me !
so far the events of Tre@@ asure A Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organise their own history .
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ placing the sovereig@@ n debt from the US
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , on 72 million US dollars , diverse religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march was launched at the State Building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audit@@ or@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ ot@@ ting of debt ) and the eastern General church in Puerto Rico .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the new debts have also filed a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os calls for politicians , ri@@ cians and government authorities , who are responsible for debts for their corrupt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial review and a committee today without personal interests to public debt , with a firm , our working conditions and conditions which act in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refused to blame a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be shown with sin@@ ks and pen@@ sion@@ ers .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not into the sovereig@@ n sovereig@@ n territory of the USA - suffer from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for New Economic Affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a ruling @-@ independent non @-@ profit organisation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on government responsibility , as an alternative to existing government supervision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; putting pressure rose out from the outside without the participation and conviction of citizens to become dangerous , rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the book , which was published last year and is here licence @-@ free , includes a number of papers that deal with free culture in face of oppression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book intends to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designer , developers , researchers and writers , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked on page to look over the fo@@ g who surround our news@@ letters and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free b@@ ass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , who has im@@ pris@@ oned the beloved and celeb@@ rating Internet volunteers that has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was rep@@ ain@@ ted from the directory of Ad@@ ra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive memory gives his friends and his family a voice who im@@ pose on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us start to think about their own destin@@ ies , actions and decisions .
why are we today here ?
what did we decide ?
what have we given up in this process of tim@@ elling extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activists is since March 2012 in det@@ ention of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the Ad@@ ra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to be transferred to an unknown territory .
his wife , the writer and An@@ a@@ tin N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of one as &quot; strictly secret &quot; the military court of his cell from his cell in Ad@@ ra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad &apos;s government and took notice of an in@@ comparable death struggle against her husband .
his place of residence and state remains unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons is involved in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techni@@ cian and currently transm@@ it@@ ably the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of Bas@@ hes and cultural prototyp@@ es were more up@@ li@@ ent than the work he began to re@@ construct with a group of ar@@ che@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cru@@ ci@@ ble of many ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations , and here in Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and pers@@ ische influences .
Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip set into digital ar@@ che@@ ology and the preservation has created a time @-@ capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
typically , this project could not yet complete this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I &apos;ve spent my entire life so that freedom to dream and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace them .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call its name .
Bass@@ el brought me English to me , even when he was already in cust@@ ody .
I learned to read English well , write and speak .
he always has his knowledge shared with each person who asked me . he has taught ways to read and speak English .
Bass@@ el introduced me the door to the technology . he taught me , both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
he also contributed to other prisoners as they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi also is the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a Pro@@ sper@@ son , which she wrote in 2012 until 2015 her husband when he was in cust@@ ody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el and N@@ oura worked together on the book for one year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she s@@ cour@@ ged the lyrics to him if she visited him and he transferred them out of the Arabic language .
the book is licence @-@ free .
book envel@@ ope by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that in the world I fail in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection at the moment in which we embrace ,
that any of the haz@@ ards is no matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , bonds and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the prison side of prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
that I drink with passion for me ,
if your eyes probably will say
and I &apos;ll let another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ eliness ,
to get all the moments returned ,
and to smile about your absence and to smile .
I &apos;m overcoming myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the Bass@@ el wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year betra@@ ying , my soul
while
I am in your c@@ age ,
and you are still in the c@@ age of monsters
Bas@@ in &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protest in 2011 against the regime Bas@@ har al @-@ Ass@@ ads , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Sy@@ tor@@ ches Network for Human Rights ) disappeared more than 65,@@ 000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared in a force of violence through the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , since 2011 , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nest@@ y International have died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrian in det@@ ention .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are repe@@ ating our demand today in the hope which we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : for corruption repression from release to post @-@ tent@@ ative post
Moz@@ ambi@@ an re@@ acted to an inter@@ rup@@ ting loss in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption has been committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , arrested in 2008 and was sentenced in 2010 together with four other def@@ endants due to ruin of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money origin@@ ates from public funds of the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza is between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called for his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company , what happened on 19 April then .
in accordance with a statement of the general legal position of the Republic , given the application , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ b@@ aza , again to refer to its old posts as the firm received no discipl@@ in@@ arians after his incar@@ cer@@ ation .
however , a lot of people called for action not well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de p@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , shortly CI@@ P ) , an illustri@@ ous institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to resume the director :
represents a rel@@ ap@@ se in the fight against corruption and clar@@ i@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as CI@@ P .
what we take note is that the company would have been able to have a discipl@@ in@@ arians against the infrin@@ gement .
however , the firm pointed out however and promp@@ ted no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the tropical social media , re@@ jects this behavior likewise and consider the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ lic@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and eat half of them .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and make his image pol@@ ishing .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to become re@@ integrating into the firm which he helped cause damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be happy to be paid for his silence .
resistance !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ av@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ kaner and Student of Political Science in Brazil says , the director had no mor@@ als :
Cam@@ b@@ aza by the state rewards because he in@@ vigor@@ ated him I can not believe that anyone recogni@@ zes someone in such a way that has already massi@@ vely increased the state in such a massive one .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state but instead it serves only by the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as hand@@ some it was tired of an in@@ exhau@@ sti@@ ble money source and the state itself is tired of man , the up@@ loaded and ultimately sentenced to a long sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so comp@@ enced .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , recall that a th@@ ief is in prison :
di@@ ebe belong to prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ting and - next door - proph@@ etic re@@ akers .
one of his most famous oral depic@@ tions was , as he confirmed energetic , that &quot; a ambitious man was capable of everything , also the f@@ ather@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he does not change t@@ actic , but it does not apply from its ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also diver@@ ged :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years away and was free .
and today the company is engaged in which he is money le@@ ap@@ tly , again under contract . # As@@ co Vai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &quot; means K@@ ich@@ ek@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ ey@@ b@@ se .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the famous social network included their post@@ s from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word still is being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin , or used in general as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the crus@@ hing &quot; ( in bur@@ mes@@ ischer Scripture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ valuable con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the people in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may usually be associated with racism but the word itself calls not automatically pro@@ ach to hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that post@@ s in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts purpose of his use .
furthermore there are several castles words with the different mean@@ ings which have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair will be written on Bur@@ mes@@ an even &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &apos; ( Sp@@ ok@@ b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( v@@ eil ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos;s ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ n@@ utzer A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the Word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a spiritual nature , whether they knew him , how he could hear his back pain , by taking a word play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) to Bur@@ mes@@ an - res@@ embles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ills is the opinion that she will l@@ essen the language of radical nation@@ alists , but he also stressed that Facebook analytical needs con@@ soles , before it spread all the Post@@ s , who is in suspic@@ ion to spread racism .
Facebook lö@@ scht the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automatic mechanism is not understood what you are as@@ best@@ seller on fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should instead make , the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the following words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar P@@ ae &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists spread the hate speech which received quite good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cis@@ ed its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all of sending the Hass@@ an language , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ eks have proven that the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often will start a kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game , whereby users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author of A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his post@@ s , as he wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; banned from the social network :
... when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook , I made a mail to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ on@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and was prohibited the Li@@ ken , post and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards was not correspon@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of Post@@ s from people who have no negative intentions , or who simply try to show their opinions on Hass@@ an &apos;s nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should do more about the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
such words are to be cen@@ sored even more hat@@ red within the different communities .
furthermore it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical assistance and have forbidden the words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they tried not to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Post@@ s .
if they had only little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would have a big turnover , this would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automated c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has ensured for a lot of sk@@ ill@@ ott among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now using Facebook funny and consciously you write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , to see if their Post@@ s are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots from Facebook &apos;s Post@@ s which were not used by hate speech , but still removed :
used with permission .
the bur@@ mes@@ an text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and give a pe@@ as curr@@ y and an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook is the post , which contains the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screens@@ hot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mail says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screens@@ hot , used with permission .
in the past five years extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists are to have used social networks to enhance their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks shall also cause violence in Myanmar with in addition to heat , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have brought up thousands to escape .
Facebook has been for its failure to carry out the young@@ sters Hass@@ an on his bur@@ mes@@ an pages under control , critic@@ ized .
but instead of simply speaking the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would be better to focus more on the context rather than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the child &apos;s marriage
a wedding @-@ ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s mon@@ og@@ ist in Trinidad and Tobago is now illegal .
on June 9 , 2017 the parliament of the country has un@@ anim@@ ously decided to offer a law which is intended to offer this practice , so that the ep@@ idi@@ se age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the spouse , some members held hin@@ dering and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aja , the leaders of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered , that the state should not inter@@ f@@ le , since this , the age did not reach the maturity . &quot;
this happened , despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s legal prevention is to be the min@@ ors as being defined in 18 years of age .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical summary of the country confirmed that since 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements that stri@@ ves to cut laws to the children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed big support . undoubtedly helped them to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader for example had no concerns to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should do , dam@@ n &apos;t care about their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused the tensions in this really unusual thing , and eventually got doubts as to whether the opposition would dis@@ agree with the bill .
however , early 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - in spite of 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , who were contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and will announce the law .
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave to Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram has again posted :
Mr Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ramb@@ har@@ at : the bill &apos;s draft was decided against the children &apos;s House , with 35 votes for this , and no one against it .
after having previously agreed in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws to the children &apos;s marriage have finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , which held a Minist@@ ries in the Education Ministry , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has left the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s mon@@ og@@ ist in Trinidad and Tobago is now illegal , and that is almost worth every cost .
while A@@ bel Jackson the opinion was , there was definitely long enough time to complete the practice , Lara qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook of Lara qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which said : , , Her@@ pre@@ rag@@ ing news !
the sp@@ ouses has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for them - 0 on the other ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ low Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the hom@@ advis@@ able age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the kind of religion ( 18 years ) .
the draft version to the modification of the former , was decided on June 9 , 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties , and of which 35 were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the members , who have been against , have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s mon@@ og@@ amy is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ or@@ it@@ ild@@ ed .
many thanks to all activists who have fo@@ stered him .
hearty congratulations .
a Thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible case comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aja , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u Organization of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aja has proclaimed its intention to undertake stra@@ igh@@ tly steps , the law should be adopted and he seems to rede@@ em his promises .
while the prosec@@ ut@@ or of Paris Al @-@ wi , an advocate of the law , it was certainly legitimate , if Mahar@@ aja is going to proceed against the law , most social media users would like to approach the debate differently .
Patricia Vor@@ rell hit :
dear sat when we , instead of talking of the discussion , in a way that , only panic and im@@ pover@@ ished , if we would like to talk of the problem that , that the state , our daughters , protects them that they may be affected by great , hard @-@ made men that are compared to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
but if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s mon@@ og@@ amy in different shades , or continues to be the norm , although there are laws which they sub@@ ordin@@ ate .

through the mir@@ rors of websites , Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again

for over a month Turkey has spar@@ ed the popular and on the crow@@ ds@@ ourcing principle based Enzy@@ klo@@ p Wikipedia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day will be more evident how important the platform for users is to help you find helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and journalists and fans of TV Serien @-@ portra@@ ys themselves against the lock@@ out .
although many technologies used internet users are used to use re@@ winding tools for block @-@ aligned websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest V@@ PN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been rati@@ fied by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Har@@ vard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet since 2007 have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
to China Turkey is the compul@@ sory country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked there are now several mir@@ r@@ or@@ sites ( sites which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( so machine computer compounds ) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is available in spite of a law@@ ful pro@@ hibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS was reported about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) we put all this , snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot achieve the website www.@@ wiki@@ pedi@@ a.org .
IP@@ FS was likewise suggest@@ ing that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it was only about scre@@ enshots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the web page .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to get the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ sonn@@ i by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ mb@@ .org , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ side of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mir@@ r@@ or@@ os if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .

there is no complete copy of a proxy , a mirror .
one is att@@ acking another URL that is not the original . that which one then sees is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia hand , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves when they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photograph@@ ers ! !
I felt at home straight away , when suddenly Nav@@ ar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is located only a few minutes from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leop@@ ard was up and I immediately began to stop images ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Nept@@ une and wants to deep@@ en the understanding of that wild animals are not as fri@@ gh@@ tened as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood some tig@@ ers already from face to face :
a tiger can not distur@@ b itself from the mind of the sheep at night ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the he@@ avi@@ ks appeared . he immediately draws , we see ourselves , and gaz@@ ing through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environment protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nept@@ une and wild animals is not always easy .
he wa@@ ited 22 days long , and mostly lived in a tent in order to make at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took to take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information .

this entry was written by Kay@@ ona@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on a film Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India the women prevent the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh , women have to respect that due to social pressure to respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should ab@@ ject the norm to keep this practice on life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by a head@@ court of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a and contra@@ sts their family and the village community after they had raised a raised relatives with names .
the tradition of their wives are also not being called by the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not apply this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , about nine women , including health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and thus became quick to the main @-@ visit theme of the town .
it is a place for them to discuss and discuss the int@@ ric@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
being one of 56 clubs , who are there in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of the Vol@@ unte@@ ers .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was worked with the help of her Vide@@ ok@@ am@@ era for seven years with the help of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS , and leads to these clubs .
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have taken them into amb@@ assador of change .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion , was by women who call their sp@@ ouses .
she decided on this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking the name of their sp@@ ouses , is a link to which it must keep all duties and never put into question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition shows that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman that doesn &apos;t hold this is seen as a list , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tradition is so deeply rooted , that we never have never thought until this discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who previously had never called her husband , who had never called his name at home , how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband weigh only after the video was finished .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I sol@@ ete him from now on at his name .
with this confidence in his luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor ever before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Prad@@ esh .
after the video projection the women investigated the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , up@@ set , sad , loving , and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our sp@@ ouses , but they can call us what they want us , means they do not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day she who brought the name of her sp@@ ouses of her husband , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the pre@@ mise of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the married women who would never speak the name of their sp@@ ouses .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise it was just before ch@@ att@@ ed ; another chose to let the whole p@@ ent fru@@ stration against him and his family by using it .
the expression on their faces was ek@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ur@@ old Br@@ auch , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands .
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband called a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas put them in his head : his wife could not stop his name .
a different club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she has strengthened , she was afraid and said that there was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I shall do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less clear and the situation of art@@ is@@ cent in force .
raw materials reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the carrying out of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot at the forehead , which indicates the spouse :
why do only women show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the car@@ cin@@ ch red point if he did it too .
he laughs and I heard him to carry him .
the other women have not been fully resolved with it , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose , even to take him in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what could hear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their life , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and command@@ ed about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been linked with some things , for example like our ident@@ ities on our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they happen .
in a discussion , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have taken only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ v@@ ah @-@ spa , a wide shirts over a tro@@ users , wear ; they have not dre@@ amed .
after much argument and discussion on the advantages of one &apos;s own clothes , mor@@ als joined with the Sar@@ is and much more , cour@@ ageous m@@ ini their own pair of cur@@ tas ( Upper shirts ) into a discussion , so that the women could carry them .
next they have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and raw materials is certain that they will be able to do it .
at the question whether in the five months have already been changed since their first discussion club , Ra@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened then again to the name of their sp@@ ar .
some , including myself , do it still , but only if they are alone and are not part of other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their sp@@ ouses ; only one or two women are now carrying zinc at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ og@@ ging for more freedom of movement or the own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a hard to navigate .
by giving each other self confidence they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and other people about it reports , what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

at the beginning of the month three men in the district of Mil@@ k were killed , a few kilometers from the border to Mal@@ awi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been taken .
two men were arrested and as a consequence they st@@ alled that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Mal@@ awi are used .
the local super@@ st@@ ition will believe that the head of a scr@@ at@@ ch@@ ant man &apos;s gold contained old or wealth could bring , the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ ist@@ ers declared by Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that conf@@ lic@@ ting attacks on gl@@ assy men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que were registered .
another group , which is the purpose of ass@@ ass@@ ination for ob@@ sc@@ ure , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in South Africa took a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of the southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ st@@ itions and prejudi@@ ces .

the persecution and murder of gl@@ assy reason@@ ing specimens for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ah@@ é@@ zia , for probably aber@@ gl@@ iness , has cultural motives and is considered by the traditional sham@@ ans in order ( PR@@ M ) which also indicates that a belief existing , according to which the victims would have power in their head , the ri@@ ches of ri@@ ches .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , that probably has been made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as a partner agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the incar@@ n@@ ated Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he has been sent to the hospital for liver cancer in the end of June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ missions ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after having been involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that has been involved in China . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China has referred to Li@@ u as a &quot; an internal matter and a narr@@ ator , he said it as &quot; is not required to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
however , China still receives views from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , permit or give it a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ized the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing are different to the subject completely .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d Ra @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , held in late June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
but a spokes@@ man refused to comment , whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to provide a treatment abroad for Li@@ u abroad .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u release .
the Rel@@ aun@@ ching relationship between China and Norway after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , though the Norwegian Government is considering that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were once again continued in December last year . only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the scor@@ ing industry after China because the exports have been blocked since 2010 .
after the news was spread that Li@@ u was seriously erk@@ ran@@ kt , the Nobel Committee did its hope for an unconditional release of express@@ ing his prize in Oslo .
because of his det@@ ention he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was promp@@ ted to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house ar@@ rest and permit him to seek medical support , where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ u for the release of Li@@ vi@@ us as a statement on June 30 .
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
France and the USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , as much as it would help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman in the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the message is demanding the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house ar@@ rest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the invitation of the U.S. message moved an angry response from China according to the utter@@ ance of the State Department , that &quot; no country have the right to initi@@ ate and ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom such as travel mobility and access to medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal systems as well as international commitments .
the US Senate Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have just introduced a decision in Congress to release the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally release .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government speaker &apos;s Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; received all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President of Xi &apos;an was issued on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing the news &apos; Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns if the vort@@ ex about Li@@ u could visit the visit in Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um decided to provide adequate medical care to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to care of his family .
Li@@ us An@@ lawyer told AF@@ P previously , that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but police are always monitored the room in the hospital and that there is Li@@ u not allowed with someone outside , including his couns@@ ell@@ ors , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights law , including free speech , and release free freedom for the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s State Department called for China in an explanation on June 29th , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . additionally , his wife and his family may have contact with him .
although the news section France information reported that the French government Li@@ u would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department was announced that there is no further information that France will finally record it .
Taiwan
the Council of the matters relating to Taiwan calls on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance on those seeking peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ w@@ anese law of Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party , China also called on to allow the sick of intellectual li@@ u to treat in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very worried in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave us that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he was strictly pun@@ ished , led to a harmon@@ ious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which could have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally pleased and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected people , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter of 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or land ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may appear sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognised as an independent state in Singapore .
but , according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered a city in Singapore .
this remark also triggered a debate in the blog@@ osph@@ ere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Prosec@@ ution association of the State New York , the Minister expressed that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he &apos;s support that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... no one has question@@ ed whether new York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io addressed the Minister of Justice to rot@@ ate its logic in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and dist@@ op@@ ies to create this valuable country , you can say that we may not be a country at all .
it sound@@ ed so vul@@ gar , it had the s@@ emb@@ lance of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , w@@ essen the country ?
the reasons led by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared inev@@ it@@ ably un@@ democratic .
however , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore will be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old body re@@ appears from the author@@ it@@ arian leaders who have to be democr@@ ats , abandoned the twi@@ sted logic , since it adap@@ ts better to their power .
in the end of the last week , Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am &apos;s reaction was given answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our J@@ udi@@ k@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions tar@@ ma@@ c with non @-@ responses of rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a little difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , in which country is ours ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ gr@@ ye would take the trouble to clear this point unless he was paid up to be part of the city &apos;s government .
by sending a comment on the blog , he pointed to the reviews that one should begin to read the whole co @-@ magazine of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am better , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the description .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore was so un@@ equal even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of those cities did a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has not meant to be in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , who makes as leader of a her@@ e- generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am over what the Just@@ iz@@ ers of Singapore said to be very embarrass@@ ed ...
at least I knew about Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ v and the members of the old Gar@@ de , what I expected - if I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ gr@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts , and I am not even sure whether he &apos;s really believed to be correctly involved and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review Dis@@ counts the f@@ aking points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ enten :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher itor ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereig@@ n state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereig@@ n rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique ; it is equally rural and city .
because he plays an important role within the government &apos;s government , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am is gra@@ vely mist@@ aken .
why do the enterprises pay their military service , they defend only their city but not their country ?
whom must our prime minister pay in@@ voices ?
what is the value of our pink recruitment ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the magazine &quot; Jour@@ ney of a decade &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added the magazine &quot; Jour@@ ney of a decade &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Singapore and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have sad@@ dened a lot of Singapur ...
nobody ever said , Singapore is a country .
we have always been a city .
we have always been a city / Island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the country before all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Can@@ adi@@ er &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screens@@ hot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked above his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or native country ?
your answers are presented here as part of a continuous series , revealed by the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and to be shown another fac@@ et .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is being put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered to be polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
on my clar@@ i@@ fications then follow the default st@@ ems : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Natur . &quot; lots of Canadi@@ ans might cook internally before W@@ ut when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t inter@@ f@@ ere it .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans of Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian Flag good at her ru@@ ck@@ sack when travelling .
all love can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , however ... .
it was so , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , in front of the march in Iraq and before 11th September .
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le sheets at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there is no weapons !
DC @-@ a mar@@ riages have been legal in Canada as early as 2005 !
all appear to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we clearly say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is alle@@ ged@@ ly considered as the toler@@ ant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate the .
first , I have many American friends who I very ad@@ mi@@ red .
I would not do anything if one would consider myself with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; first : as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means being said to be sp@@ ie@@ ously - like the good @-@ ef@@ ull , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed flan@@ ders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ lon@@ er ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Canada would really be a nation full of people like N@@ ed flan@@ ders it would be a step forward . but the real problem consists of it , that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can encounter .
be harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that pass around one around .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a main pecu@@ liar of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence up to the neighbors .
we lack the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open friendliness that I joined now with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) pray then Just@@ in Tru@@ deau the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada straight too sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has published a music video , which took power to the Jun@@ ta , which 2014 took power and to restore the civil government in spite of its promise , the country govern@@ s the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells them what regulations are his girlfriend .
although not explicitly political , the music video itself refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was used by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video about the song was a great success .
within the first three days , that was shared by Facebook up@@ loaded video 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and was awarded 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists representing the public to view this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to the Thai politics , as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
let &apos;s look at these recordings of the videos that have addressed on some of the political issues that have been prosec@@ uted in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relate to the dra@@ cal section 44 of the pro@@ visional Constitution , which grants itself an absolute decision @-@ making itself on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; introduction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the implementation of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to conce@@ al activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , super@@ vised online content and subjects , which is thrown out , the monarchy is persec@@ uted , prosec@@ uted .
Thailand continues to set a stand against &quot; read Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ä@@ ts@@ ei@@ r ) .
the war @-@ law was launched on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to persec@@ uted , their decision is to buy expensive underground boats , even though the security per@@ si@@ sted they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video even shown how people are thrown into a black tank @-@ carriage , before they bring them into an inter@@ connection bearing , a further problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they alle@@ ged@@ ly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and the Internet users are lo@@ os@@ ened for a long time , should they off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band displayed the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated that was already used by put@@ sch opponents during protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the host@@ ages in East Asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian war has been officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the Northern District in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the carbon @-@ bas@@ ins of Ab@@ k@@ asien .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Nor@@ theast Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked together to sovi@@ ets in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today we live for the largest part of Russians and n@@ oses in the area .
such settlements are called in Ab@@ ch@@ asi@@ as well as gh@@ ost cities .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people living here today , today there are only a few hundred people in these spirit @-@ cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic of t@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the District was 16.@@ 000 people , after having barely risen across a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story living @-@ blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , will be called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ cho@@ va , stand symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are fallen and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
it begins a conversation and it falls him hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of the community served .
now , there are only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or @-@ buildings .
people who once lived in this place and managed to contribute to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have meanwhile abandoned the district .
in the spirit of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live approximately fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
K@@ hr@@ ush@@ cho@@ v , who still can host one or two families , one can recognize in the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when she discovered me with the camera in your hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother allowed us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has simply forbidden us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to her girlfriend and suddenly she leave the destroyed building and van@@ ish .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining companies named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ demand ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the District administration supplies during the winter for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
a decade ago he moved an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante g@@ alya , as she is mentioned in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not leave before Ab@@ k@@ asien to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ asien , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot constantly do this - everybody is busy with their own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story seems a younger neigh@@ bor on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls T@@ ante g@@ alya her to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could hire Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation partnerships Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they rec@@ alls the vill@@ agers before the war .
despite the relatives , living in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia collap@@ sed simply ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative Distri@@ cts in Ab@@ k@@ asien ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but this will take something yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explain it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
your man works in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once found , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
it tells us that at first there was a very anxi@@ ous situation than many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time they lost their anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has more to do with pl@@ ot@@ ings .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation incl@@ ined to the end , a little boy goes over to us .
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy j@@ agt also behind him .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
one group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them sit down on the dropped buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood which ensure authenticity in their lives .
you know it not any other way .

Mexico hosts Africa &quot; migrants on her long journey
Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez heads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , to the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the mex@@ ican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , situated on the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ olds , a little woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink Br@@ ill and gol@@ d@@ coloured ear@@ rings in Ted@@ dy@@ b@@ ären @-@ form .
it is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born there in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and has grown up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.50 Euros the night sleep in simple rooms , with figures , cr@@ um@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the fo@@ rest@@ room there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a c@@ age .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants are here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people tells in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you m@@ um Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes .
it does not want to decline any anyone .
she also helps them to hospital when they are sick , they purchase them medication they can &apos;t pay them , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m that sco@@ red from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if m@@ um Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ g mou@@ sta@@ che ) posi@@ zes with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; respond with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very f@@ ond@@ ly .
it has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , the hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
the family had heard from other way@@ men from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he relates that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the circuit , and that the Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
how many of his imm@@ i @-@ companion has lived in Brazil before , and worked as a building workers upon site construction of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he began his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months now : he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Bu@@ ffy friend to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; says he smiling . &quot; we will always be in contact . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that their guests are often sending text messages , if they are gone to gra@@ b them or to report their over the course of their journey .
they explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she does not know much about Africa , but their guests has taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is known here very well , but it is not the only radio for migrants to travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city there is a dead @-@ sa@@ c to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family are migrants in her small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the Bu@@ ffy is to be sold at many African migrants .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar spent the night .
at the moment there are 25 people mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on blan@@ kets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook site outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela illustr@@ ates that he knows what the guests do through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border into the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was instruc@@ ted to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants who travels through tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he was f@@ lown out in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squee@@ ze him out of money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and a well @-@ known , an all @-@ known , has offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa is anything again full of guests .
in the ways the passengers consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a majority from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that their house is full but it is also nost@@ alg@@ ically , because of those that have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she sang in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ styles that you made a r@@ ally in his grand@@ children , some photos of her grand@@ children and lots of travellers , young and old .
she laughs sad , while she presents them briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ eron , &quot; they repeated every time . &quot; they are already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app to their mobil@@ es .
a Check @-@ Point für Personal Communications Equipment in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter @-@ User
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are comp@@ elled to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 received the mobile users in Tian@@ shan District of the Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile phone not@@ i@@ fications in which it indicates the District government , a monitoring app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should prevent the app to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but col@@ ò@@ n@@ ated the authorities use the app also for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had installed the app to have exchanged messages with a private We@@ eks group .
the police agree that the app would determine the sources and distribution of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; dam@@ aging information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for kids and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ ade porno@@ graphic web @-@ sites , from online fraud , tropical and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and control their own home network .
this app with the filter for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in many different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government actors or even h@@ acker to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of the digital activities in this region .
while the reports of digital c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in China tend to focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often d@@ us@@ ur@@ ers for those who live in remote , displ@@ aced ethnic min@@ ors like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to rest un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ cal Internet down@@ turn .
das auf Twitter @-@ based Media @-@ Out@@ let &quot; Images from the mainland China &quot; ( the retail@@ er offered in China &quot; ) , the cen@@ sored news in China showed photos of a Check@@ point , at the police officers the residents had checked that they had the monitoring app installed .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian authorities make sure that people use the official Jing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are having a check@@ point with a device without this software they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a proposal for the technological development .
they have comp@@ elled the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tivity through the surveillance technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from the country of China &quot; ( retailers of the loan agreement ... ) also published a Nan@@ w@@ ang Product description , resulting from which the software can lift the password to a Windows operating system and therefore get un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing Jing@@ w@@ ang your computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become an electronic hand@@ piece .
the provisions in Jing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city &apos;s party Council to minimize the circulation of illegal content .
all government agencies , authorities and the associated facilities , including universities and research organisations , are oblig@@ ated to follow the Cyber@@ security Office &apos;s instructions when running their computers and communication equipment .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobil@@ es , external drives , portable dis@@ ks , not@@ ebooks , and media channels &quot; register by local police .
the intention is obviously any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; however . however , this action hurt the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives it pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible failure , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single plot in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep &quot; or death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane illustr@@ ates his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you &apos;re looking at and stell@@ ing that you &apos;re all alone in one place where anything is important .
everything has gradually dis@@ solved and revealed to a truth which is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
one which makes all the honour of her name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expres@@ sions , which no met@@ aph@@ ors allow .
but when you catch the reality again and you are looking behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn into being characters from meat and blood , and all scre@@ ams upon death .
all doubts solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence even if the Earth will turn on the axis of the we@@ dge . you will realize that you are caught right here between walls , your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to have built stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that still not so I mean &quot; my lesson &quot; - as the boss of the safety services it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he presented his power over us under evidence by even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts they knew .
five young people were tor@@ n out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protests .
it came out , so that the city cr@@ ying the darkness of the night with &quot; all @-@ attitude &quot; scre@@ aming .
all the neighborhood S@@ cri@@ bes on , only my own .
for the first time it was silent , rest@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t set high demands on a town that is ste@@ ered up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
during the third night things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply in the area stopped working .
I broke the silence by asking several times &quot; all@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; by my house@@ d@@ ach .
I heard my voice through the silence re@@ cl@@ ing .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were made cour@@ ageous enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends closed to me ; we alli@@ ed us to a glorious picture , that full of my expectations .
in such a moment you become aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but you simply don &apos;t be interested in the sc@@ ing@@ est .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he placed on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey may hin@@ der you - nothing can give you your voice , after you put it all the way up to the office of the safety service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear like you &apos;re &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are just cour@@ ageous enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ amm@@ ing eyes sat down on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are thrilled what to look in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure of my job when I said , &quot; I would not thought you have forgotten my voice again since yesterday .
and I believe I &apos;ve never ceased to look at you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that have been such fatal consequences for me , and yet I &apos;m not shy of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in single and His Father equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rock @-@ tank of this mon@@ opol@@ y lies in me up to now in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a myst@@ ical torture , which I was exposed to monthly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am cr@@ ying the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I want to do with me .
afterwards again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a hall@@ way to the individual cells .
I give me all details precisely before I super@@ v@@ ise the room .
otherwise they probably have a larger cell .
I must share it with only one single prisoners and may immediately sit down without having to wait for their permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I reached to a long @-@ proven communication method : with the f@@ ist against the wall to beat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my second @-@ sto@@ ols was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first mo@@ cking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells , there was an un@@ fores@@ een man middle age that looks like me and &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness do not let me know a distinctive face lifts , and doctors are not there any ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds similar to me that sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was put into one of the great cells .
perhaps he will immediately list@@ ens .
the investig@@ ator had as@@ sures me , they would leave him when I stay .
fan .
I &apos;d like to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to distribute all these cro@@ ws that lab@@ s themselves in the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always ask for this time the hor@@ ror , every day .
the door opens itself .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of ruin , until I saw the yellow light which presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ y on the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; you are here to be wast@@ ed . &quot;
that was the secret of Israel : to protect the security of the state in front of us and prevent the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ ical dial@@ ect - so they played their denomin@@ ational gains and caught the narrow point of view of their world view .
this is not a house that is here is not a country ; it is a cur@@ se that she co @-@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of her K@@ lan@@ s into a hero .
I support the inter@@ rog@@ ation and re@@ efs on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and stupid man ; at least he comes before me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in spite of the facial expres@@ sions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can begin so much more important with your life than to protest these Tag@@ edi@@ eben and protest to demonstrations I &apos;ll soon find a conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I rep@@ lied .
I got acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to reply .
I can really no longer exactly say when ins@@ ults and impacts on a friendly interview for me become an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to blame for myself , even though I had nothing to do to earn this punishment .
at punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to get as much meat as possible from the body to me .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; gest@@ ures . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which is probably from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker takes a rejo@@ icing on your scre@@ am .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot ref@@ rain your cry .
my hor@@ ror fell not yet enough , why she inter@@ ed the tube by a cable .
in my first det@@ ention I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier than gar@@ bage collection , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cable infected with each other to present to us from their point of view , great discovery of a giant Kab@@ el .
within a single hour three of them can be altern@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , so I listened to scre@@ am .
the ex@@ ecu@@ tion@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and found no reason why he was next to an electric st@@ akes .
flow through my entire body , enough to feed my entire quarter .
my semi @-@ naked body that was spread out on the floor was the perfect flow of electricity .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
it must have been so about midnight .
I decided to put my sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left , who arrived for me as minutes .
then the call for morning prayer .
the door opens and the bri@@ ghtness meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answered with the voice of an exhau@@ sti@@ ble teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and Bewe@@ g dich , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Gulf Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b re@@ members about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ Community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smok@@ es a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends much of his time in the inside ; sometimes he sw@@ ans his canvas , time to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine pat@@ ented lips .
he lives in the chief econom@@ ist of his family house , which joined them in 1967 ; the year , in whom Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family were forced to fle@@ e from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faced the conservative majority and question@@ ed their old views on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rapid music .
with his music , who often cle@@ ared together with topics such as Oriental alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world . all these issues are also found not only in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to according to San@@ aa in Y@@ emen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at H@@ d@@ ai@@ b as someone who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries , and he can suffer according to his own statement with the people who suffer the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Y@@ emen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not ad@@ mits it openly , he p@@ aves a special circum@@ cis@@ ion against the US @-@ American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war @-@ areas , something that can be done with his identity as &quot; Palestinian pi@@ ew@@ ed the second generation - so he referred to himself even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I do not think because of my own life conditions , &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b .
then he adds : &quot; I think that , because I am a man , &quot; while he dis@@ solved into water Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the divine month of Ram@@ adan ; in that time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise to sunset .
the present law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sens@@ ory hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of hot coffee and the sc@@ iss@@ ing of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette smoke in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when looking at a glance into the neighboring countries .
therefore , one simply avo@@ ids things to do basic things - like in the public during Ram@@ adan water - to not end in prison .
recently , the home of the Jord@@ ani@@ ens brought a appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ Lei@@ la cancelled , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the j@@ ord@@ ian branch of the Muslim Br@@ otherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osex@@ ual front Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for concert dead@@ lines .
the MP and former press spokes@@ woman in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the firm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many affir@@ m that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous acti@@ vis@@ m , which poses the alt@@ est legitimacy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ rou , Lei@@ la , the MEP , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive signat@@ ures of human rights , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which still has chosen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement might not simply be sil@@ ly @-@ sei@@ zed of the rh@@ et@@ oric , but in fact a more and more evident reality in Jordan . this statement clearly expresses the work in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Werk clearly .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s traditional gender equality to cor@@ be , by em@@ bo@@ red his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the sk@@ elet@@ on of a clearly dr@@ unk , un@@ familiar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ de &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch said that the number of Honor@@ ary mor@@ de in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still creating that Jordan has not yet escap@@ ed institutional infrastructure to support women who were victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law for inter@@ ruption lasting control from the year 1954 , women who are exposed to risk @-@ owned violence , &quot; insi@@ cally held in prison , &quot; and for her release is often a years of bureaucr@@ atic effort and the guarantee by the family is needed that the woman has nothing to happen .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known , also not shy from subjects claim@@ ing in his country long to t@@ abo@@ o .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b stands that his work is political , however he believes that he is his music , which is full of exp@@ on@@ ations on sexuality , freedom and freedom of expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Man .
I was conceived in politics , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is again on poverty .
the list of songs which are in the core politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated many times :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words , &quot; that can be &quot; - be it faith or not @-@ faith , Het@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on gender equality for LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals were still highly cen@@ sored .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular S@@ ord@@ ian On@@ line@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , in order to mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments made from the context was tor@@ n and his opinion has been cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but there was only one working version , &quot; says he .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b we@@ aves open for the arab@@ ic LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als do not speak of Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ es , a poet of the eigh@@ teenth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ es , who was to work later once on behalf of the cali@@ per , to write in the 8th century openly about homosexu@@ ality , why does Jord@@ an@@ ier not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom , it is nothing new that the government has been sanc@@ tioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
still recently , in January 2017 , the schedule compet@@ encies and members of the school association , with the reason , they would have expressed themselves on comments in social media and critical of problems related to the corruption that are deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the gig H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs in mind is that only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a struc@@ tur@@ ally changing in the next generation of the Jordan Valley .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now managed to die Mas@@ h@@ rou &apos;@@ Lei@@ la now for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks very slow , bed@@ time and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the present society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , of a Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he dreams not only of this , his work as far as Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; them . &quot;
perhaps the region is spoken by means of music , art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bom@@ bs , part@@ itions and man@@ made democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also res@@ ist resistance .

Neb@@ uta to A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
these big , ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant war d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
we suspected that it is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory means that the stron@@ gh@@ olds ran over more than one thousand years , and from a time come , in the arm@@ ies of the West Japan in the Nor@@ theast mar@@ ched in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , into the kne@@ es .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to catch some great seats , so we got a super view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I look at it for a long time the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en : two stron@@ gh@@ old have just been seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ o Festival is the only truth - and a breathtaking way of spending his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; the summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the &apos; Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 metre high stron@@ gh@@ old was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely , outer appearance and body care is as important as in this history , because they help keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and promote a legitimate business like the hairdres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us more important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smok@@ y and illegal drugs are everyday .
in April 2017 , the survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel secure .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more norm@@ alb@@ ran@@ gers in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can form these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the outer limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there are experts on each other to show who of them can create the ec@@ centric waves , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to spend young people in order to spend their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor ratings in the hair@@ dressing tools that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have seen do@@ zens of young people that they can grasp a profession which is currently fashionable .
the school gradu@@ ated before the school year which begins in March commen@@ cing special training courses and reported some of their successes :

Colombia : lovemaking to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ ä@@ ber

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the processed version of the contribution of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lovemaking &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we just write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who come across to bring affection ?
precisely this question went by the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation is no longer of his head and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters for reconciliation ) , which young people get to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters .
only recently , their country was a place of a historic event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had formed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa W@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signat@@ ories of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
there is still a long way before the Colom@@ bian@@ Woman , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ cks , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric , and around the clock bore their weapons , now they have to be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn has got acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hate against gu@@ err@@ illas , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans would like to join and in the integration process .
and this exactly what did they do : until now , thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages for former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ms to welcome them back in society .
the target of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for any former gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ cks - which should then be handed over to personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters for reconciliation was created at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Crist@@ ian the opportunity to speak briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i who was granted the Nobel Peace Prize .
that explained that we love the people we love , by Valentine &apos;s Day thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need much unnecessary .
he left , he told him to share his love with people this year , who needed most pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the plan , letters , full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war story into a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to date , more than 2000 ters were accum@@ ulated in the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city &apos;s administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation to transfer my letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC fell on how they used it earlier to increase the commands of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of sub @-@ protecting people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an assistant of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we handed down the letters , a former fighters led through the camp of the guer@@ illa @-@ fighters .
when I saw into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut that lived in the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ cks ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ or which wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL gran@@ ules , a deadly weapon in the thorn berry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I still spoke to him and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I responded to a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so nice , that is why I responded to that . &quot; because I suddenly enjoyed the tears over the che@@ eks .
I aw@@ oke it completely and sat down next to the gran@@ ites .
perhaps he was tired of the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this figh@@ ter , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only chance to preserve him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society that is waiting with open arms in us .
so far I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
to the over@@ clo@@ cking , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together on a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC were already in sec@@ rec@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have experienced the social in@@ justice from the state across the Colom@@ bian people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help create society in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the purpose of this scale , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
hearing these people who have never had found hearing and had no voting right , and to recognize that people who have often seen as monsters and even h@@ assen had learned even people with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , does me sore .
but it com@@ for@@ ted me that all men - also who have killed and have so much damage to bring us something , and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the com@@ mander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the colum@@ test@@ ers was made , that after the dra@@ fting peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there are inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are prepared to access the weapons , to rise up and to protest for their rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we at the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology - they belong to all those that dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties ahead .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a trans@@ vers@@ ine talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life of Kad@@ y@@ row

homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion .
with hor@@ rors , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of pregnant men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by a di@@ amo@@ is value over the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community does not occur only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared with us some of their experiences and talked to us about what happens in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conqu@@ ered the international head@@ lines since reports released , indic@@ ating the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised .
the first report was published by journalist in Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya inn@@ eta ; they cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the ev@@ oc@@ ative que@@ er men stron@@ gh@@ olds , and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a mon@@ ster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ vers@@ ine , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grew , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya had no more secure place for them , why they moved to Moscow .
after a group of ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the sex @-@ meeting of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the USA .
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in an human rights organisation .
one day I told me that somebody needed my help .
it was a friend of Dag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ vers@@ ine that arose in difficulties .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread them anywhere on the internet , using my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by the very f@@ hat@@ s@@ app the lap .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was there , I heard a few shopping street from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male hat : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you by your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned out , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing hur@@ ting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still want to honor the family , du Sch@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that there was a young man , no thirty years old .
then I lost the consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital again in the hospital .
apparently some women got it all and started to scre@@ am .
the man was f@@ lown .
the women had called a nur@@ se .
in the hospital I learned that I had two m@@ oo@@ ges in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances , you were placed - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name in it , but the doctor sold and put me in the women .
so I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ ang@@ kas@@ cher name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a alp@@ space .
my family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that everything was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I had to prove it by walking up without the streets ; others wanted me to read on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have body @-@ size C - what should I say on television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for her .
some older people spoke to my mother on the road .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a mon@@ ster to the world that not only has your family , but the whole of the Republic .
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she lay down on his neck .
luckily the neighbours came and delivered them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with a flas@@ hing window was@@ hers and a plate sign with a 95 .
after the third time it happened was clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my rights @-@ rights @-@ friends over@@ looked the h@@ edge di@@ agrams - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how have you been flying ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something happened .
I can still not grasp what it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering , without notice , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived on and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stran@@ ger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you believe in security , just because you left the country ?
you already know our people in which you know . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the number 115 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : do you have any questions about your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not talk about the sex @-@ separation , but this is a tabby topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditional k@@ iss@@ asi@@ an elements I still carry in me .
as much as I wish , this sec@@ ular barrier I cannot overcome .
I say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give to my efforts to look like the person who reminds them of their past - that is , in my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who are d@@ ort@@ ations ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for the needed , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone , the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not shut down a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
so I mean , they most likely invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end are demanding proof that the so called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood Gen@@ ev@@ tu@@ ung .
OC Media : are also now still missing men in these secrets ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there was not so many .
if , then especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives in order to establish them Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they will be held there so that one can present them later as terrorists .
say : should they be re@@ pris@@ oned it will show their bodies on television and claim , they would have attacked some village or a military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , they are purpos@@ ed to radic@@ alize themselves .
OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I was looking at someone who was killed in the two and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown the beard .
there was no news since then .
they have simply taken them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person himself was with them as these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as band@@ its , there were no reports yet . we susp@@ ect that such activities are quite possible .
why else would you not allow this man to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , &quot; had taken place in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried my hair up long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think that early in 2003 I was already known quite big , as I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was defined , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
Russia was originally planned to lead us to &quot; civil civil@@ isation , &quot; ultimately brought us back to the St@@ one@@ age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the F@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were awesome , I had the colored eyelashes , carried the tube @-@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the security of the Sch@@ aria has never made me a hair for me .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , mainly at weekends , quite a group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several B@@ än@@ ke stood , and the whole town knew : they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ote does not say about the disaster of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if they make a lot of sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you because they felt , they are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never bel@@ ated me , never h@@ unted and never be@@ aten .
OC Media : how long did this grace be remembered ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking about mor@@ ality on TV .
he did not talk about us per se , but priority over the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city began to change .
who had previously depos@@ ited and gel@@ laugh@@ ed , viewed you at once with suspic@@ ion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what activity do you go after ?
Sabrina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much .
that &apos;s why I still operate as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a type Psych@@ olog@@ in .
we organise teac@@ up , I beg@@ in@@ ite them to hospital and help them get Es@@ sen@@ sk@@ arten .
I haven &apos;t been a p@@ enny for this .
I discovered these people myself when I turned away .
I am Muslims , and would like to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you have a Hi@@ j@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
this is the nature that has nothing to do with religion at all .
that is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to tell you with foam before the mouth , that there is no b@@ umps on them .
those Dag@@ est@@ any who have the cab@@ aret , who have the Russians also ; on the entire planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , that &apos;s why it is unpleasant to me so what to hear .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practi@@ cing Muslims living in the mosque and during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think at Tran@@ sist@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that you changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ction .
these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be precise , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ash@@ amed for my body .
not , if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be here so personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ad@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate among the native Arab population .
there has been a sharp increase in self @-@ murder since the last months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ad@@ z .
photo : use with author@@ ization .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 rec@@ alled the dist@@ ressing situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran which is characterized by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the southwest of Iran .
he lit@@ ude among fear states , depression , and he is ash@@ amed of his own help , which can arise in@@ capacity for his family , as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ad@@ z and remain an@@ onym@@ ously .
a video shared on YouTube was held the moments after he had been stran@@ ded himself .
some people managed to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was transferred to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ ad@@ z .
local sources said that the com@@ bu@@ ns were so strong that doctors could no longer do .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide who has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists , on the spot war@@ ns that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights announces that this month a couple of others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - recorded .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family members who felt thanks to persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable of supporting their families and to follow a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region where a major part of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community live in Iran was sh@@ aken by a far @-@ reaching economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to ride their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ ad@@ z was a predomin@@ antly autonom@@ ous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power over 1925 , and 1925 extensive efforts made an end to complete autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ ad@@ z region there are some of the largest in Iran @-@ coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the wid@@ est and valuable commercial space for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slow , and the local population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and austerity .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a variety of insulation material , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian regions where the Provin@@ ces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dem@@ ons have only led to ev@@ acu@@ ated the devast@@ ation in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local farmers as well as the fish and palm @-@ industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi people has now rose to 81 % .
NO@@ UR Muhammad Moh@@ ammed P@@ ur , who held an Iranian Director for co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who finished a job , completed primary school , 55 % a secondary school ended and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; the number of self @-@ mor@@ den among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that unemployment has become more disast@@ rous . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ancestors and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since Func@@ tion@@ aries and institutions not pre@@ fers an Arab working force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will ent@@ ail access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs , and force them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hoods outside of their homeland .
there are people who had to change their suburbs and names in order to hide and put up their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as an Arab name will not be toler@@ ated , because speaking the Arabic language or the wearing Arabian clothes .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to end@@ ure , sm@@ ite human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world awak@@ ens and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is negoti@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional . &quot;

the following article is an revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several conversations in which many different positions expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not femin@@ ists , react many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well thought , scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ists , and why we are generally all femin@@ ist * inside .
for instance , women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education .
that women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women should come across a gl@@ ude earlier or later in diverse areas of life , and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is conscious and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I am double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin colour , racism , on black CIS women , on black tran@@ si@@ sts women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ pora , if I men@@ tioning , in which way we &apos;ve ever been disp@@ ersed , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been silent .
however , they agree that women - all women - should come together to up@@ lift &quot; their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing , &quot; to reach the equality ( some ) women .
but they don &apos;t want to speak about sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alised violence , there are rac@@ ist violence that we are exposed to black women in question .
or in addition , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and spaces of origin make less than white men and women .
that black girl and girls are referred to as a migration background of the school as white girl , due to obvious integration issues .
or that women are exposed in black spher@@ es and women with a migration background to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership has to suffer as white women .
on the one hand I want to incorporate all men , all the men , and all human beings , all individuals , and on the other hand I can relate to a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands to take into account un@@ just@@ ices in their thinking that relate to the sex as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere , who led me and countless other black women ever and over again .
So@@ jour@@ ner we@@ pt in 18@@ 51 in their speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also raise myself to sustain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized beings .
I ref@@ rain myself to join group@@ ings which also absor@@ b our customs and customs , in order to advance its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to paraly@@ ze white women about the importance of cutting of skin colour and gender . because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to in@@ struct them for a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different homes and limit themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of myself full and completely of femin@@ ism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of working for me a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a New phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spher@@ es which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana . ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can con@@ quer ourselves , that we can defend ourselves on our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered all the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will call immediately separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , please inform you about the hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m existence I have existed .
I will be recognized as a part of the para@@ dig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of the para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can er@@ blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;

ever again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surf board or can@@ oe - with a special concern thanks to the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains the relationship with the rivers and the impact of pollution to his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; told Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of cau@@ dal , the pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ e@@ pers Iraq - an subsidiary of Water@@ ke@@ eper Alliance - who work together to protect rivers , streams and water roads in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a brings the ur@@ gency and the importance of his work together in a question : &quot; if we had no water left , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq dom@@ ic@@ iled docum@@ ent@@ aries and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , fil@@ med and published .
the focus of her work lies on followed , little contrac@@ ted sub@@ cultures and is distinguished by the use of co @-@ operative vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help oppressed communities , their stories to tell their way .
Paragu@@ ay women and her difficult fight against violence

the following article is the short@@ ened and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ rd @-@ women ) that reported on the violence of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the people affected .
a police comm@@ iss@@ ary said Ada B@@ á@@ ez , that she has nothing to do against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ cre@@ atic , who could have become violent for violent .
since the end of their relation was some time passed and the police said , their testimony would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mis@@ representation , although the ac@@ credited display of Ada B@@ á@@ ez is nothing .
a few days later the second woman drew her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are displayed at all times , they do not generally receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who mis@@ use them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who will admit , victims of violence to be victims of violence at all in case of law enforcement authorities .
inhal@@ t@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ic@@ en@@ 2 Un@@ visible abuse and a legal system , which is not on imm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay . good approach , sub@@ standard implementation and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really negoti@@ able , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that do not even show to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
but the numbers available are alarm@@ ing .
in 2015 , at the district council , 9@@ 600 ads went for domestic violence . at 70 % of this it was about violence against women .
86 % of the ads come to the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertis@@ ements because of domestic violence among the peace shops , and here were 86 % of the display of women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mis@@ leading , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to information from the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women Minist@@ ries Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di actually , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; to each woman who re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psych@@ ical mis@@ representation , 9 women who do not do this .
on each woman , who re@@ im@@ bur@@ se because of physical abuse , come to two women who do not do this , &quot; they stated at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s genocide is not an own crime , the criminal enforcement authorities can not be appropri@@ ately documented , as many women are mur@@ dered every year by their current or ex partners .
by August 2016 alone until August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s inf@@ anti@@ ci@@ de in the country .
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay was documented in at least 37 cases where women were mur@@ dered by their current or ex partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence accompanied by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that is not doing nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z has became the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she was named him all her former friends .
in the beginning they didn &apos;t want this , but still there . this should be forever rep@@ ent .
today , Mari@@ ana 28 is 28 years old , and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psychological violence of her turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogni@@ zing the most severe forms of violence against women .
I never thought I would be victims of abuse .
when I &apos;ve read earlier about it , I always thought that only women have happened to be sub@@ ver@@ ish , because they are dec@@ ei@@ ving themselves by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without name to name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had lost her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked the rh@@ et@@ or@@ ish , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refuse to conf@@ ess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen so long about Carlos and left him past .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos which was not from Paraguay , fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner sw@@ elled them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which consists of women who are all victims of abuse all in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listening to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ an case everything started with mental abuse .
their wealthy partner finally managed to convince them that they were worth@@ less .
then he started to beat them .
Victori@@ as advertis@@ ements in the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives , she received no support .
it conducted a process against its former partners who developed into an un@@ transparent legal struggle between Paraguay and her country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ay laws : good approach , sub@@ standard implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , provides great problems with the application of laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament which was known under the has@@ ht@@ ag # Por@@ El@@ las ( # Für@@ th ) .
this has@@ ht@@ ag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ immigration ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , supported by Am@@ nest@@ y International .
the original bill of the law fores@@ ees , Fem@@ izi@@ d to explain and to pun@@ ish a stand@@ off@@ ence and tough@@ er to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the leg@@ ality in some points has been altered in order to also win the proposals for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions will be p@@ aving the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had envis@@ aged , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) treatment costs which have to carry out the victims of violence at the present time , if they simply have the display and wish to receive a secure accommodation , to surrender the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ing that the law does not effectively be if the law@@ makers do not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay the abuse as part of human relationships is seen .
must re@@ think about this , violence is no longer regarded as something Nor@@ mal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who@@ ever does not em@@ body the face of these facts is concerned and contribute to the absence of the crimin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to re@@ funding so long that mis@@ management is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . but previously , some parts of the law was adopted , among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners in cases of domestic violence was reconc@@ iled for reconciliation .
the opinions about changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for ag@@ g@@ ressor , to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fil@@ ing of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ sment &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , is regarded as a great re@@ vocation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in O@@ man postpon@@ ed another year to ban on a newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was locked down because of the decisions of the ministry &apos;s information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available on the homepage of the For@@ bidden City Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago the om@@ anic authorities took an independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ z@@ Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where it f@@ ates a one year @-@ year imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and put to trial , but later came free .
O@@ man is governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power since he had his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of State .
since then , he d@@ ressed in addition to his role as the sole Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Minister of Defence , Finance Minister , Minister of Minister , Minister , President of the Supreme Council for planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the sult@@ an is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces , especially of domestic violence , public freedoms , including press freedom , and def@@ enders , and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , and other activists , to in@@ timi@@ date and to be held .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities on human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , including their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and det@@ ention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which 2007 was reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) since it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , was firm , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , he was published in the judiciary on 26 July 2016 . it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government conf@@ uses , judges of the Supreme Court to have put pressure on O@@ man under pressure to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he received Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editor , invited by the ISS and was arrested upon his arrival by the security gu@@ ards .
on 9 August 2016 the ISS awarded the dep@@ uty chief editor You@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acts as a chief editor .
the newspaper was closed at un@@ certain time after the information that inform@@ s the statement that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any route , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first hearing took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison doors and also ord@@ ained the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned to the use of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ excav@@ ation of the objective of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty about the violation of an audience and the reserve for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year adhesi@@ on , at the height of both 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional work ban against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year in prison and fine in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after having used the use of a information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a pre@@ payment was established in altitude of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was already released on August 22 , 2016 before the Jud@@ gment .
the Court of Appe@@ al said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dism@@ issed on 10 April 2017 in exile of its sixth sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he used his one year imprisonment .
the Court of Appe@@ al also highlighted the decision of the Department of Information , the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again permit , the newspaper continues to be postpon@@ ed due to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January the Information Minister expressed a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister under@@ signed a further statement , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and thus , the Minister expressed another time against the decision of appeal to permit the publication of the newspaper .
the long @-@ lasting closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in recent times .
for further injury , for example , the closing of the websites of independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent Online Newspaper of the country to hire its operation .
because of the long @-@ term closure of Az@@ am@@ n and det@@ ention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of freedom of press freedom .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and unconditional ;
2 . ensure a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can go on their work ;
- to protect freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in O@@ man can di@@ ct their right@@ ful human rights , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial care .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ state organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in ad@@ joining states by encouraging establishment and freedom of association and the right to gather peaceful , support and protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses an urgent needs of the continent .
for the need for medical research there are two reasons : to a lack of global health care , many medicines and vaccines that meet the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and mal@@ aria in the poorest countries have far greater than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is conducted by African scientists themselves , with the development of own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er is Director of Central Education in Zambia School for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ s ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he sear@@ ched himself on HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the s@@ amb@@ assador of the health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. W@@ arri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of media via this research .
( Disclaimer : Dr. W@@ arri@@ er speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it W@@ arri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . at the moment I support the s@@ amb@@ ic National program for anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy ( ART ) with labels tests .
moreover , I have just step@@ ped up a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic testing testing for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogen@@ s .
G@@ V : what do you think are the important topics of scientists in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basics of basic research . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support arrive from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go back here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure do not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age groups .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , Big Data , research of the space , the health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
G@@ V : may you describe the pros and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa in western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often there are the limited speed , things to do and the scar@@ ce access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system , that journals are only accessible to payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) is also limited to the amount of availability information and the speed of research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers to change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been founded in the United States for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous , the first plant , which cultivated by NAS@@ A ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in the outer space and consumed .
for nearly 20 years Mort@@ on has been working only by his own imagination and the question how many sal@@ ach@@ ers can get sick , bo@@ unds .
but in the beginning of the 2000 he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were pat@@ ented , and therefore he could not use them on the bre@@ eder .
the patents exist not only for individual sorts , but also for certain properties like resi@@ li@@ king of diseases , a special red or green or cur@@ ved leaves .
more and more such patents have been registered in more than ever more plants like cere@@ als or cardboard boxes . due to these trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are responsible for food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mort@@ on is still salad , but now it takes longer because its work is becoming more and more complicated by more restrictions .
&quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a rock @-@ rock , in order to add@@ ling the wh@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breed of tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says he . &quot; I think that this patents go on Sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they held the court , no one can breed any new sal@@ at@@ ory , because all the characteristics are already pat@@ ented . &quot; he makes them as good as possible and attempts to solve those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful , however , and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Centre ISS have red Roman sal@@ at of the Sor@@ te Out@@ red@@ ge@@ ous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten there . there , if plants can be cultivated in the universe .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like this would be the movement out of the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; Software , providing alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into life to make sure some plant types and gene will not be protected as intellectual property and so are used for plant bre@@ eders .
in the framework of the initiative , called Os@@ si , we can commit US @-@ breeding to others that could freely use the seeds from them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds , to breed , in order to breed such own varieties , and it doesn &apos;t immediately so@@ w - two aspects associated with many plant pat@@ ente respectively .
do@@ zens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
the glo@@ omy views
for the emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si boards are control over the seeds and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds , such as seeds , rights of farmers , control over the nutr@@ itious system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to utilize the latter not or only little by bre@@ d seeds with natural resi@@ li@@ ency .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement did not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
all kinds of plants might be pat@@ ented whether vegetables , cor@@ n , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says good , locally and sustain@@ ably productive vegetables , as such as being offered on farms , should also know that the way is bre@@ d on how this vegetables is bre@@ d .
nutrition is not possible without any seed &apos;s sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative will continue to commit to others their seeds as well . by contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ar@@ dised because the anti @-@ pool is due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material , which is therefore always available reduced , dis@@ advantageous .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive President of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doc@@ tor@@ ate with gene@@ tically variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . it found that about a third of all mon@@ ot@@ ten@@ acity is protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bre@@ eders either not or only scar@@ ed .
for other plants there are such estimates still not , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that custom @-@ built plants such as wheat has been pat@@ ented in even bigger styles are pat@@ ented as a salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are bre@@ d so that they can specifically identify properties - from those who improved their flav@@ our or colour through to those due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders are reduced by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions change by climate change are much worse .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaker in Car@@ ly Sc@@ adu@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monthly activities . with a total of four cont@@ ender and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company will ign@@ ite for the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property other bre@@ eders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ eti@@ ology innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that can be followed once the patent expi@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions can help others with another method for the same result .
such protection would be in@@ hib@@ ited so innovations not , but it promotes the public and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different about 20 years until a patent expi@@ res , is certainly no innovation .
and if you are waiting for such a long time to cultiv@@ ate on plants that are adapted to the altered environment conditions , the fight has already been lost .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general public and we should continue to stay , &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers easier for farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we cannot continue using the best and newest resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall , Mort@@ on has bot@@ t@@ apped by Mort@@ on on the concept of patent @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not create the characteristics of himself .
the plants do they form themselves and as bre@@ eder , we ultimately have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si boards , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who@@ ever bre@@ d a culti@@ vat@@ ure , bre@@ wing its own values in them .
who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ o@@ ulas , for their cultivation mass @-@ wise ti@@ bi@@ zi@@ de , is bre@@ d in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to are ) , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are patents and own patents , create it with most smaller seeds , even without patents to survive - either do they reject the patent or they keep it worthwhile for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case .

I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are to sell my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years before competition , bringing in my opinion very nicely . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; sound , the concept is growing rapidly all over the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , an &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed Programme works to work with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to get &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which ultimately is a form@@ less and legally binding form of the Os@@ si requirement for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding vary from country to country , why the Os@@ si commitment is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission , declar@@ es that conventional plants should not be pat@@ ented , so that it speaks against the present practice of the European patent , patents in conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a statement is not a law ; now it is at the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed companies and seed companies from all over Eastern Africa came to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ ent@@ ance of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains that the organisation is currently running an global alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for the planned next year of the official start f@@ uss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seeds map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , is published by the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report that farmers have the opportunity to collaborate with seeds , exchange and improve seed policy , thereby ensuring a stable supply of food .
in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply , with seeds for sustainable food , empha@@ sizes - a connection , by which Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that soon more people will be recognized .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly observed where and how something grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to clear the people that even more behind their food lies . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still , the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it &apos;s the website of an human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of May 05 , the Egyptian government has reported the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reports .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where it has been sharp critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ bt@@ w in spite of this attack and the exter@@ mination of the Egyptian and the constitution by the authorities , to pursue such goals , so it was never as difficult as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I have confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted , in order to overcome the block@@ age and do not pursue . we ins@@ ist to fulfill our task any further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first z@@ acked website of an human rights organisation in Egypt , following the authorities more than two months of 21 Web pages , as well as independent news of MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and this from Qatar restored network of Al J@@ aze@@ era because of &quot; support &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

besides AN@@ HR@@ I also includes the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights scientists Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no access more in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes for in Egypt is not accessible online sites and media .
now , the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the state apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which it is also located in Zi@@ adas blog , is on the other hand being accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , has been arrested nearly 500 days in cap@@ tivity after he reported in December 2013 by Egyptian security gu@@ ards while he reported on the students &apos; protests and took a video , like the police har@@ v@@ ated physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed itself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs about lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of an executive condition ; a det@@ ach@@ ment , an abandoned murder , pre@@ ten@@ ure at the national Security Council , the Cor@@ ks@@ giving blogs as well as any other web site , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not vain . in other words , my words have an impact , even if only on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles in order to handle the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship .
but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the Mu@@ y go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ou@@ and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) sper@@ r@@ ten Egyptian authorities from May 24th till May 06@@ th of 133 web pages . this takes technical tests in networks of various Internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of vendors , through the circum@@ vention of Intern@@ ship and Private Sur@@ fing , so called Virtual Private Net@@ works ( VP@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12th noted , like the block@@ age of websites , the VP@@ N@@ s .
such a practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and fil@@ tering that the Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is in addition to wor@@ sen that the decision @-@ decisions made behind closed doors , by which the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis , using which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and whom will it be next attack ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the citizens are scattered .

day for day report newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ olds in school , &quot; &quot; J@@ eden second day will be ass@@ ass@@ inated a police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves Don@@ ated chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends the 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and Lu@@ qu@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the economic situation in Rio has reached the highest level since 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian government @-@ government Global Justice called on to interv@@ ene even the United Nations .
reports such as these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the published data published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on 16th August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report on crimes that in every big city on the world happen like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex , etc . all , what happens by the civili@@ zed standard , and what is happening only in Rio &quot; is published in the section &quot; war in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a quad@@ rant video , which was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper stated that this decision does not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declar@@ es that according to the Department of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the article , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war is discrimin@@ ately , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover .
but we defend the war based upon information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aims is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
have the name &quot; war &quot; more than it uses ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasil Pur@@ pose the journalist to call force the violence as a war . in their opinion a just@@ ification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibilities with the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military prepar@@ es in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education , and historic and self @-@ pleas@@ ing le@@ ct of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil were according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , Rio on position 16 , &quot; she writes .
specially belongs to the company Glo@@ bo , the largest media company of South America , which stresses that Cec@@ í@@ lia has repeatedly empha@@ sized the security policy of the state .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) was the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , whose objective is to con@@ quer the F@@ av@@ ela by emplo@@ ying a massive police force and a unit lasting there permanently .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent crime . for several years , however , the U@@ PP for several reports on s@@ lic@@ ans and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux is from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio is not related - the criteria for the design@@ ation &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war has serious consequences for the people of itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls upon the state to use funds and ways that are typical of war . this belongs to the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contamin@@ ated balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caught &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war , or her , fact is that the residents of the F@@ av@@ ela in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police came up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ cin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence also this incident also made : an or@@ char@@ ist died as a result of shots that had p@@ oured the police out of a helic@@ opter .

as a counter@@ judgment , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics is the inhabitants of the East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; .
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i are not part of the traditional , planted foods in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , its food quality makes it an attractive food source for many residents of the Belgian East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direct Elec@@ tions of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said across the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of pilgrims because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years now , this project is known and pres@@ cri@@ ed its relief that it gains more and more &quot; by famili@@ arity . &quot;

at the time of the Constitution of this article they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel of the fuel , local ingredients are used from plastic , to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; production &quot; from the Reg@@ ions Pil@@ z@@ seed &quot; before they checked their quality and if they are suitable to consumption .
subsequently they planted a small pil@@ ch@@ yard in a tub . as this achieved , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lec@@ turer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , mushrooms have been distributed throughout the Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to bring people the Pil@@ ch@@ backs for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fraction of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were wo@@ unded at the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government had a final week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ ic@@ ia in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it appreci@@ ates that there were more than 500 fi@@ d@@ olls that spread in the northern and centrally located regions of the country , about 250 millions of hectares of forest and numerous ham@@ lets .
in June , in June , in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande you had a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wo@@ unded .
according to the European forest surveillance system , that supervis@@ es the forest surfaces via satellite recording , alone in Portugal about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest inc@@ iner@@ ated - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon .
to allow you to make a better picture of the position of Ernst : there is only in 4 districts no fire .

the fores@@ een tragedy
the aim of the protests of the Saturday was the call for better preventive and fire fighting violence by the state .
the people asked themselves why the civil protection was not able to put the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al at the Bund of the Republic of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do that anywhere : there are un@@ used reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria could have played a similar tragedy as in June because the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits are being in@@ quired with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the forest f@@ laws which had introduced the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was applied by the commun@@ es which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government led a p@@ all@@ ure of the law which allowed the construction activity by case , if the applic@@ ant could have a means to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leading the gu@@ val in the same article by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environment organisation Quer@@ il made aware that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made out of slightly com@@ bust@@ ion wood , itself , as in a devil @-@ circle , after br@@ aces of this species continues to spread further .
to these problems discover that the Web site of the civil protection from Portugal on October 15 and 16 , as inhabitants were looking for or tried to contact relatives , go offline .
it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information provided : they used the own civilian protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and inform@@ s the population in real time over the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of João P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire fighting off and was sent on this fat@@ eful weekend in October allowing the server to the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who held the fires , held this website more than half a million access .

dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ ek@@ i &apos;s leader of Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat had just been mur@@ dered by the Taliban , and a lot of Haz@@ ara felt worth@@ less .
the Taliban fighters were ever closer to their hat@@ red .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ af was found in Pakistan .
he worked in a coal cra@@ b for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little sal@@ ary , and walked in Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish sa@@ wing with mort@@ ar that were he@@ avier than him , in order to earn their living .
at that time , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; reminded of A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( af@@ gh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on the job@@ site , on which we also worked .
there was no service and no heating there . we mounted n@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we can &apos;t refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing in the sea he lit ship@@ wre@@ cks and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities were rejected his asylum application , A@@ ON@@ af 2002 came to Italy .
some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church , which distributed twice the day eating in uns@@ killed .
true that Italy due to relatively high of the will quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers are in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil liberties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; exceptional performance centres . &quot; this is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and non @-@ prepared staff . &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers will only be assigned to an insur@@ rection centre if they officially have an application on Asyl@@ um - indic@@ ating after the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers can still go on a monthly journey .
until then people who have no money for an accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it is also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his mis@@ erable life @-@ w@@ ille helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years working in construction , A@@ shar@@ af reached its entire savings through the founding of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a boot@@ able .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director A@@ min W@@ ah@@ id@@ i .
the movie was awarded to Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of people in the company were created , including tail@@ eries , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ m@@ adi had the idea to its restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the chef will be largely refugees from different parts of the world .
the restaurant &apos;s menu is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes , the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals set far beyond the Italian gastronom@@ ic and retail trade and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where a risk is , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happ@@ ily , if I know that my people suffer .
I am planning a project for peasants out of the poorest provinces in the country , especially for women .
they represent the half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af nar@@ ro@@ ds also plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but at the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament ver@@ ified a draft law , which provides users to use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration in a government office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users may need to take advantage of the social networks , within six months after the use of the authority on the website of the authority under the specification of their full name , as well as their exp@@ ul@@ sion .
who@@ ever dre@@ amed this move could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the en@@ tri@@ vial of a criminal law .
the law , which was applied from six@@ ty female members , is currently in the legislative and the Constitu@@ tional Committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
in May another dep@@ uty shall be a law@@ ful statement , in which tough@@ er sanctions would be introduced for the ins@@ ult of the president or at a high officials .
under Egyp@@ t@@ isches law the Siege of the President and government institutions is already tigh@@ tened . under the legislative proposal , however , would have such an effect , however , with pris@@ ons and money tigh@@ ten , so legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would be a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , which took place on 13 August 2013 , while they prov@@ oked violence against demonstr@@ ators , which demonstrated against military coup , who had led to the original President Moh@@ ammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan wa@@ ited , as did more than 700 Protest@@ ants who had been arrested by the same incident , four years in det@@ ention to a dish@@ ster@@ one .
recently his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the pris@@ ons were referred to according to human rights groups , which accused the accused of prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
in the latter , Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , their dist@@ ressing of e.g. arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and murder .
in another case a criminal court appearance in Giza was released two journalists h@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting to pro @-@ mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the Court reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ es@@ ic milit@@ ants to un@@ le@@ ased documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform of N@@ awa@@ al and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been question@@ ed to a penet@@ rating action plan . said Plan from the President of the Republic , the busin@@ ess@@ men and the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused , provided these all un@@ law@@ ful funds .
this document on 21 April on the website of N@@ awa@@ at published document , casts a light on how the presidential plans are in support of the legal situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia met the disclosure of his sources by st@@ ating article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he entered the district court in Tunis , on the 09 May as a witness .
will China force the users of social media to put their reference ?
according to new provisions of the Information Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission to write or share messages in social media .
the following rules will also be stated that the registration will be necessary with the full re@@ movable name .
anal@@ ysts susp@@ ect that by the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within the social networks shall be reached . it is up to now un@@ clear how the authorities use these regulations .
Chinese companies have proposed policies in the social media to susp@@ end these regulations -@@ sel@@ ective in order to protect European journ@@ alism and independence .
then we will see you in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may , the state c@@ ens@@ ory of Russia granted access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or failed We@@ chat to register with the state government as the &quot; Organ@@ izer of the information spread . &quot;
this design@@ ation is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government is conducting a list of online services , which author@@ ization &quot; release of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removal of content and to force them on request for suspension of user data .
these web pages are currently websites like V@@ kont@@ akte and od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russian two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the E @-@ Mail @-@ Service Mail@@ .@@ ru and d@@ utz@@ ing of other services .
Turkish Court has a Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish judgment had the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administr@@ ators , to clear two English @-@ speaking articles , the information that Turkey support the ji@@ ha@@ dists in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been blocked , the site was locked because she works on &quot; a source of information that works with groups to don@@ ate a political black@@ ater@@ al campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey &apos;s website is completely blocked . it is therefore , besides amongst others China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop , her@@ ff@@ les
following this week , the British government is in the midst of targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance measures , which would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and de@@ cryp@@ ted the data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations companies and intelligence services relating to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population .
despite all this , the consultation was still ongoing until 19 May . responses and proposals from members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the ministry .
