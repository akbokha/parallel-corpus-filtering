<seg id="1">Although I had been visited the US for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me too.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I have grown up with American films, American music has been writing to American music, American authors and playing their sport in place.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist for a American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14-year old, I saw the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who covered with the help of Julia's Roberts as a Jura-student, which covered the highest court course with judges, who were interested in meeting his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free to Method Man, "I was as if this is the absolute truth, certainly everything else, it's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only reinforced.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, the variety is so inviting, that you can always be the one that you are and it's easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very fancy love cover about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is about with its Engdies.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never keeps his mind behind the mountain, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latin, Afrounders and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people are responding to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican presidential elections, was the highest number of nominate by the party of nominate Candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans, who support this biggie person, I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was able to get Trump and his voters don't tune with the people I had seen during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist, the people from all over the world gather, a deeply believing man with whom I was able to entertain me about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, a trumps worldview does not match Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Sun" at stake.</seg>
<seg id="25">Haze intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr who fought for life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappl, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, there was Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me much with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by them embodied values deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump removal his way to nominate Republican candidates, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people have been tuned for wearing, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump voters as an racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, told one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an incapacity to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, some of whom are white, have agreed for Trump, because they would like to regain control of a country that has disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick which commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who look with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (Anm.).: so much like "sitting of the White against all other ethnicities"; words of white in honoring to the whites and whiplash, what is like the great Van Jones, has exactly the killed that America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate American ideal - regardless of whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have, America means everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose to be his president, twice the son of a kened, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America of America, and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole term of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In the Americas, after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruin, saying it.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a manifestation for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a vocal change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a "" "" no "" ""! "" "</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roaring the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latino had a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Will Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He obtained an unanimously and soundly "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "God is praised that Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now pile country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks down my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, which is played at both places, not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the fall</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby underground ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years, the La Banda de m√∫sica (music bande) in the municipality: one of children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found an opportunity to overcome them with musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is the main interest for the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The parish, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drugs abuse and bananas violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But after a random meeting, this changed after an accidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, says the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come out of school they walk back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and play with shiny eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from M√ºll</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunci√≥n in Paraguay, is located on instruments produced from re-value waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for music instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler under direction of Favio Ch√°vez began to transform parts of the crash into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, Celli, double basses, flutes, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire draws classical music, folk music, paraguayish and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Ch√°vez, a local economist and musician, the children of Cateura reminds us of the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult, because we had no room to rehearsals but we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash. children don't know any music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">The changed as Favio has been shown something that he never had seen before: one out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments from recurring material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) acts the musical performance by:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces approximately one billion tonnes of trash each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest people, like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from ash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The Orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis,</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo ¬© FISH-i Africa - a project that domiciled illegal fishing is fighting.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that has deliberately reported on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time it was known that this ship already had been operated in Liberian waters illegal fishing and before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were therefore discussing here, and have little inclined to welcome a legebreaker of this kind in their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comers, Mozambique and the Seychelles, mobilised swiftly against the ship. they refuse to give him one of their harbors and refuse to give him a fishing reserve.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refuse to" "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leitner meeting of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship of order and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch the fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the fishing stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">At the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protects, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO stop illegally illegally (Illegal fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries, which then had driven the prime minister in their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries which are interconnected and work together. they exchange information and stand each other at where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project ending illegally Fishing. this project provides user-friendly technical support. "" "</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is per definition unregulated: what is caught, is hidden because of it extremely difficult to absorb. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the intentional disregard of existing legislation through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm the illegitimate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while promotions against illegal fishing began through bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail-empo, with which information between individual countries curved, so happen the actions nowadays in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">Here, the individual countries can interact with each other for example a list of lists, news about damaging activities or details which one may have noticed or experienced during a longterm projection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i follows the activities of ships also very attentive when they move at the open sea, through satellite frequencies.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships which fishing in bothered areas. also let themselves discover so damaging treks - some such that suggest a ship to his pent fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such surveys may show whether the participating ships have a fish-license, where they were on the road and may also whether they have a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries which are against illegal fishing may refuse on the basis of such information then adopting such ships in their harbours. what does the ships could not sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to numbers from penalties, as in case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about significant financial loss for the owner, which means the illegal fishing ranches no more financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, leitner Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an advisory company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and is also supported by car-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to get more estimated 20 million USD of lost sales back that will lose eight members of the network HISH-i each year because of the illegal fishing, which penetrate to the East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing boats which attracts the region of commercial catching from all over the world. beneath these also illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among these practices, among other actions, are like the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licencpapers, listing of fantasienames, the fishing of fishing species and the fisheries in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they choose the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a no-organised control system" "", "says Long." "" "before a ship could be illegally fishing and a country could then say" You dared not walk my harbour. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Komm to me '." "" "and this legal sipole tries to close Mary-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception was FISH-i involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had counterfeited licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked vessels and found.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority for the fight against crime, I can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that is helping with FISH-i to detect ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps the illegal ships meet that they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and user-friendly technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn on for example its automatic identifier systems, which they cannot be disposed of satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information levels together. it should help using user-i to find criminal vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model programme</seg>
<seg id="137">But I can actually influence fate-i's team of African nations and have undoubtedly the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, thinks that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth launched a platform for Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed through the position of each verable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run with which a global system allows persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only touched by criminals but also scare terrify.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that have been confiscated earlier without a license and hardly reckoned with consequences, they now know that they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries involved in FISH-i countries have now a 33% increase in fishing approach, since fishing boats for more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After I had helped Somalia, Greko 1, and found the inspectors there aboard those drags there, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "also other countries notice these successes." "" "the effect is quite strongly that we now copy other countries" "", "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces, the so-called West Africa Task Force. now they are now fighting illegal fishing, depending on the same model as user-i. 'With security, the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures also in other regions, "says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently I could report the youngest member state in Somalia with his first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under the wrong flag. and not only was the ship used without a license, and they were now banned, meanwhile.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking place of measures against Greko 1 set the strong signal that they go against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>

<seg id="200">As a now adult male, Quijano was now in the frame of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of C√≥rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated which were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>

<seg id="203">Started with the B√ºrde, the same names as his father carry up to the brutal military permeditations in the prison La Perla, which he watched at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">34 years later, he kept the maryhood for itself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation then I believed that was in order.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As child with 15 years one does not remember that one will manipulate from his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, more than a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis did not have a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a period of state treasury since 1974 to 1983, a time of State rorism, was his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Commander of Intelligence in the prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. there I had friends with a guy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black-white picture and demanded me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an artichole, you have friends with some of the ERP-friends.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only means that they will not have you one day, and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ej√©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionaries's army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "parties in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he offered me to go back into the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would become any secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and I thought in that situation I thought it would be fine. for so my dad had raised me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda model, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first time and last time, he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerator, simply everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small into a ceiling tile and commanded me to wear it for the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clot of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day, I went to the other end of Baracke where the stolen items were dropped and talked to a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spelled and saw a couch, tortured on the humans.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a crib and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the prefecture did not apologize for the translation errors. furthermore, they explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation is not checked for their correctness before it was published.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">Over time, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the initial text and to active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native language. generally, the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the language language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French mother tongue, for instance, was translating from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as native language, the translations into English. this may sound at fault-understanding for the overset, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers, to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that even have no foreign employees, don't make use of company internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is appraised to the one translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sworrene and raked phrases, which can be made by machine translation, show that this technology cannot replace no human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages quite particularly.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints which often decorate T-shirts or pockets are used only for stilistic reasons - not to be read or not understood at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Transmission errors do like jewelry still acceptable or, at least harmless. but from large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city Kyoto continues to use a serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned yet is that the children must afford a lot of days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of an agreement you cannot rise.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice of Criadazis was widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing their studies Alvarenga previously worked for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In doing so, she spoke to Crime - especially young girls, who are affected by the practice of Criadazis - raised a witness, researched and pranced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the sensation of gratitude that is vaccinated, guaranteed in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazis is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, she is the family who impose her daughter in the belief that she predict so her education to improve their position in society and to do something out of himself, to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family is taking up the girl with himself and whose exploitation justifies with faith that they would give someone a chance, which otherwise would not have received training and perhaps even be starving.</seg>

<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she had never had hungry, but was also not unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the landlord's library as food from the fridge," it reminds of them.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and was assigned to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, which was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of Leopard, who runs through Africa and Asia, belonging to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus Hunicolor). in total, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and the fragmentation of their habitat and since they are always found less prey, at risk.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard shows the only remaining beast of the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the prosperity of the ecosystem also depends that a large beast of prey is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the free hunting ground is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video provides that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera all, Raza is breaking in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the high quality High School on Ship awa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, which were documented for the Northeast Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the "Triune disaster" from March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a former prefecture of Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring countries of Fukushima and Iwate were forced maracuated, because the tsunami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">To this end, Fukushima also experienced a nuclear accident, already alone it had to leave 160 000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo is seen from a local point of view that advances in the six years, to rebuild the lives of local resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority and the survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that as far as December 2015, has a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement farm (the same extends, saigai kouei juutaku) in the Prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwishads.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three Prefectures could record Miyagi, here 80 per cent of the planned subsides were finished.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is with 70 percent the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one still has to try again, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by Behind, the casetsu juutaku) in final subcenters.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people of Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of graduated from Fukushima still live in emergency accommodation, while Miyagi was more successful in emergencies, more than 75 per cent of the evacuated who have been reduced after the disaster in containers, were transformed into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">The number is 34 per cent for Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and everyday life in the three affected Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="560">How the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine at 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the unhappiness to re-establish its doors to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three Prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is much more difficult for industrial reconstruction in the three Prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation at Fukushima only 30 percent of fisheries ports in their operation.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred in the three Prefecture of Agroland large in compassion.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, whereby only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ackerland can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic process, since only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed Ackerland of Fukushima, lie in the "nuclear war zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three Prefectures, tourism had gone back again to recover, but here Fukushima remains far downcast.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level, as before the unhappiness. Fukushima can be found here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal population lives, it seemed to be more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to establish a total picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys by the native population and among the evacuated by. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how her sensation around the tsunami has changed.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native people of experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of local resident, measures have taken to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in the matter of disasters prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it comes to those who had to evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also strengthens its attention on the situation of the evacuated of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, prefecture of Fukushima was also witnessing the worst, disaster caused, atomy inif, which Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 Evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people were restructured back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the booth of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home country prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the Katastrophenols most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuated, who still have to regained in correct homes, because efforts need to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a matter of construction projects, which are part of the Olympic Games to take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Law of √Ålvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar befactories in all of Cuba were closed (photo: Julio Batista).</seg>
<seg id="627">The Volksgemeinde Gregorio Arle√© Ma√±alich, who is located in the western cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish Bumill - regardless of its fact that there are no noteworthy sugar beware on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in sugar beots fabricated.</seg>
<seg id="629">After graduation, the sugar beech industry stood still in the region, and the factory lost after and after its plants, until only the scaffold of steel and concrete was left.</seg>
<seg id="630">Around 272 workers were forced to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some are rarely the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and swing daily with the factories that are still mahlen.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who is open every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugarbehrindustry do not smoke its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He consented to be in the east of the region of sugar befabriken, who are in operation after a long period of time because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he was not expecting.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminiscent of having heard precisely that in Ma√±alich would become the sugar behrfabrik, but the promise was not held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugarbemen already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than 1910 produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for alarm for the country some decades ago, but the bad days are not a new one.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugarbean industry?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar beech industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar befabriken were technically outdated, and hardly competitive, they became unbeatable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient manufacturing, the annual production target amounted to 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0,03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which resulted in such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price increased about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report, "agricultural economic" of the OECD and FAO, the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3,6 million tons), the raw sugar export would be approximately 85 million dollars for the land.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"the day of today will come into history with certainty in history," these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From there, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">During the following years there was a total of 98 sugar befactories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugarbehrfabrik Gregorio Arl√©e Ma√±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto P√©rez has worked since 1967 in the factory.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as it is known as a soldier, about the closing of the factory, the word he is most repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place will receive, they set a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first lap years, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially labeled documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed, the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could dismiss any claim.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with subjects that are important to them. they do they using Hip Hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour brings mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centres in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio- and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by teachers David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in Northern Ireland with ten Cree Communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop-Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus contributes to the participants in discussions such as "cultural identity, language, discussion, love, self acceptance," or what they always come in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions include inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of school'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumum of First Nation in British Columbia, for example, the history of the highway 16, also called "highway of tears," at which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video games to communicate, how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite influences through globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in Indigenous languages, although the young people will not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapskoostui Cree First Nation has been made, the refrain on Cree was sung.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved find some help from Gary Jolly of Northstars Hip Hop, who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in Umschrift, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in my care</seg>
<seg id="706">"" "but I try to continue my days on earth" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you'll take our horror</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth lost our way to life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and serve as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they are destined to be Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary box the reader and supporters of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also includes a contribution and adds the strophe in silobe (which also will be published on his blog):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show the client what exactly is on the menu, are displayed close to the entrance shokuhin ECpuru (a central flavor, "plastic models of the dishes") from each speaker, which is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that were documented by German filmmakers Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, plastic dishes are so usual that they are not even striving once more. a new trend is turning it into showy cell accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that demonstrate this uncommon twist with the shokuhin.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new decorated with plastic dishes decorative mobile phones, as they are shown in Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have turned to kitschy and harvested items, as in this case, refrigeration magnets.</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a couple of shorefry magnets for a new show in Tokyo's Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the foodies is becoming increasingly wrestful.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell-stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this three-sided bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your mobile phone stick:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to watch like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of a growing approach to the comic touch.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there's someone who would say," "" "Wow, cool, now I can sect my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic surgery can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our new mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also stabling (onigiri), earrings and handybstand in dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Additional skurts plastic dishes, you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter using the hashtag # 219</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, this video gives an insight into the district of Cappabashi, giving an insight into the district of Cappella, which is dedicated to the supplies of the restaurant industry. such as the shokuhin Prpuru.</seg>

<seg id="776">Here are some extracts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Pol√≠tico, this contribution made from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, regardless of which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">Disease and sensation of journalism have been known now for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day at times of time and see the titties with images, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It takes me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as though I am the only one that is adorable or sad. it acts like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body once.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be equally valid or consider it to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year cousin thinks he wants the Narco (German: drug dealers) will be when it is great. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offences, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me that's like they were those of those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they also happen as something.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories about mere figures become within a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insensitivity of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students are justified in a neighboured place so that they were 'modest'.</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to chat that they are spared from such tragedies if they are not stir and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution of "four months of extortion in the main city district: like a family with drills was squeezed." in this she describes how armed crimes violates from their business by the end not only the business was destroyed, but also their family have torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and about how many people can change your whole life within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over that never goes, the trauma remains, the anxiety will be back high if you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, telephone numbers also changed.</seg>
<seg id="794">We just contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will lead you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I wondered in these terrible days if crying out my deep-rooted feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot how to crying. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Guti√©rrez Vega published the contribution "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Ju√°rez: a generation of violence marked."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a mismissed lady and a man who was killed by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in one settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fade and he tells himself that he cooks yourself how to cook a egg, Pottillas, Tortillas, and "Chichi" for the babies. this is his name for the preparation of the flocks with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He relates to the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all the life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he said that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years ago, when he removed just a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father was shot by armed men from a driving car.</seg>
<seg id="809">As Bryan was born, the situation in Ju√°rez looked as follows:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju√°rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ju√°rez has the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of persons according to the Board of Directors for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the amount of 8,5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories are living beyond always new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Pol√≠tico 2015 explained the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to exhibit the complex information behind the clever struggle against drug dealers, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained back to count corpses," "" "said a population of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were destroyed, were shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images could be represented at the following time.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the armrests in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt to win the Boko Haram in the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture taken back from the Democratic Republic of the Congo when it was misdiagnosed as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to get in touch with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Tyler and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) the identification of stories in their original language is a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative from Steven Bird, the unmistakable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, the focus of TLS is not on the written reference, but on the spoken word. this is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already implemented since 2015, the risk that little and not quite as small languages are not passed on to those born children.</seg>

<seg id="1144">In this format we present their story first in their own language and translate them into English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation makes it possible to take the audiences thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They both give laughter and emotions than a barrier is no longer a barrier.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developers Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, is missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But it is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Over five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regimes, his supporters and members continue to remind the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's project: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is held in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">M√©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist in the French resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara R√ºhling, chairmen produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' key books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inenquiry (The costs of freedom: a collective reresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is here licence-free, includes a number of papers that deal with free culture in face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book intends to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designer, developers, researchers and writers, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked on page to look over the fog who surround our newsletters and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free bassel Khartabil, who has imprisoned the beloved and celebrating Internet volunteers that has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was repainted from the directory of Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice who impose on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us start to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we today here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of timelling extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activists is since March 2012 in detention of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment to be transferred to an unknown territory.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and Anatin Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of one as" strictly secret "the military court of his cell from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported it was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as insider of the Assad's government and took notice of an incomparable death struggle against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and state remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons is involved in Syria and actively participating in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technician and currently transmitably the head of New Palmyra, a project which founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of Bashes and cultural prototypes were more uplient than the work he began to reconstruct with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crucible of many civilizations, and here in Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and persische influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything on it, this architecture which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip set into digital archeology and the preservation has created a time-capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Typically, this project could not yet complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I've spent my entire life so that freedom to dream and bassel taught me to embrace them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call its name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English to me, even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always has his knowledge shared with each person who asked me. he has taught ways to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel introduced me the door to the technology. he taught me, both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also contributed to other prisoners as they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambian reacted to an interrupting loss in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, where corruption has been committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and was sentenced in 2010 together with four other defendants due to ruin of 54 million Metikal (approximately 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money originates from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza is between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, what happened on 19 April then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement of the general legal position of the Republic, given the application, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza, again to refer to its old posts as the firm received no disciplinarians after his incarceration.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, a lot of people called for action not well.</seg>

<seg id="1262">Represents a relapse in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company would have been able to have a disciplinarians against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the firm pointed out however and prompted no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Eg√≠dio Vaz, a significant voice in the tropical social media, rejects this behavior likewise and consider the case as" "" "conflicting" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a sentence and eat half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and make his image polishing.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to become reintegrating into the firm which he helped cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will be happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistance!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viavage, young Mosambikaner and Student of Political Science in Brazil says, the director had no morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza by the state rewards because he invigorated him I can not believe that anyone recognizes someone in such a way that has already massively increased the state in such a massive one.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing the morals and serve the state * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state but instead it serves only by the state.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the famous social network included their posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word still is being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin, or used in general as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or the crushing "(in burmesischer Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely abvaluable connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the people in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar's may usually be associated with racism but the word itself calls not automatically proach to hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts purpose of his use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore there are several castles words with the different meanings which have the same character as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair will be written on Burmesan even 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (Spokbse), 'Kalar oat' (veil) or 'kalarkaar's (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends has been deleted today because he contained the Word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a spiritual nature, whether they knew him, how he could hear his back pain, by taking a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) to Burmesan - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hills is the opinion that she will lessen the language of radical nationalists, but he also stressed that Facebook analytical needs consoles, before it spread all the Posts, who is in suspicion to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook l√∂scht the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatic mechanism is not understood what you are asbestseller on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should instead make, the post is carefully to analyse and control it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar Pae" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists spread the hate speech which received quite good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all of sending the Hassan language, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Weeks have proven that the censorship of keywords often will start a katz- and mouse game, whereby users of social networks will simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author of Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, as he wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook, I made a mail to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically my post was removed from Facebook and was prohibited the Liken, post and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post" "" "Facebook Community standards was not corresponded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of Posts from people who have no negative intentions, or who simply try to show their opinions on Hassan's nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that nothing has to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should do more about the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words are to be censored even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">Furthermore it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical assistance and have forbidden the words such as "chair" or "inheritance curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they tried not to correct the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only little more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would have a big turnover, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automated censorship has ensured for a lot of skillott among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now using Facebook funny and consciously you write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech, to see if their Posts are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's monogist in Trinidad and Tobago is now illegal.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On June 9, 2017 the parliament of the country has unanimously decided to offer a law which is intended to offer this practice, so that the epidise age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change of the spouse, some members held hindering and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaja, the leaders of the interreligious organization (IRO), a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathered, that the state should not interfle, since this, the age did not reach the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened, despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's legal prevention is to be the minors as being defined in 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married with 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tobago 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical summary of the country confirmed that since 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that strives to cut laws to the children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed big support. undoubtedly helped them to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader for example had no concerns to say the critics of the children's marriage, they should do, damn't care about their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused the tensions in this really unusual thing, and eventually got doubts as to whether the opposition would disagree with the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">However, early 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - in spite of 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, who were contained in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and will announce the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave to Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram has again posted:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill's draft was decided against the children's House, with 35 votes for this, and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having previously agreed in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users had been enthralled because the laws to the children's marriage have finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, which held a Ministries in the Education Ministry, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary talk that has left the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's monogist in Trinidad and Tobago is now illegal, and that is almost worth every cost.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson the opinion was, there was definitely long enough time to complete the practice, Lara quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook of Lara quentrall- Thomas, which said:,, Herpreraging news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The spouses has been decided.</seg>

<seg id="1365">Follow Mutota, who belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The homadvisable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the kind of religion (18 years).</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft version to the modification of the former, was decided on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives there are 41 deputies, and of which 35 were present in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "all the members, who have been against, have voted for the law." ""</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible case comes in the form of Sat Maharaja, therefore, the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu Organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaja has proclaimed its intention to undertake straightly steps, the law should be adopted and he seems to redeem his promises.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the prosecutor of Paris Al-wi, an advocate of the law, it was certainly legitimate, if Maharaja is going to proceed against the law, most social media users would like to approach the debate differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Vorrell hit:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear sat when we, instead of talking of the discussion, in a way that, only panic and impoverished, if we would like to talk of the problem that, that the state, our daughters, protects them that they may be affected by great, hard-made men that are compared to them, would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children's monogamy in different shades, or continues to be the norm, although there are laws which they subordinate.</seg>

<seg id="1395">Both students and journalists and fans of TV Serien-portrays themselves against the lockout.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologies used internet users are used to use rewinding tools for block-aligned websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been ratified by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the internet since 2007 have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (No 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China Turkey is the compulsory country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked there are now several mirrorsites (sites which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (so machine computer compounds) which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of a lawful prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS was reported about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (on the blocking of Wikipedia) we put all this, snapshots of Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the contents on centralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content, even if you cannot achieve the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was likewise suggesting that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it was only about screenshots and no live- or dynamic versions of the web page.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to get the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni by Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklomb.org, a Mirrorside of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirroros if in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>

<seg id="1410">One is attacking another URL that is not the original. that which one then sees is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia hand, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1421">And his homeland is right next to Chitwan National Park, offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, as it helps him with this excellent location in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I felt at home straight away, when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is located only a few minutes from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was up and I immediately began to stop images!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune and wants to deepen the understanding of that wild animals are not as frightened as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood some tigers already from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb itself from the mind of the sheep at night!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>

<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar the logo "I click for" (lit.: I click for environment protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Neptune and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long, and mostly lived in a tent in order to make at Bardia National Park recordings from Ottern. up to 12 days it took to take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist information.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India the women prevent the greatest care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women have to respect that due to social pressure to respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should abject the norm to keep this practice on life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by a headcourt of the Indian state Odisha and contrasts their family and the village community after they had raised a raised relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives are also not being called by the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less remittances to fear, if any, they should not apply this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, about nine women, including health personnel, as well as housewives, a unique club and thus became quick to the main-visit theme of the town.</seg>

<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have taken them into ambassador of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion, was by women who call their spouses.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject, because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>

<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who previously had never called her husband, who had never called his name at home, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion with her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh only after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I solete him from now on at his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in his luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" nor ever before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women investigated the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they asked everyone," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our spouses, but they can call us what they want us, means they do not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day she who brought the name of her spouses of her husband," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the premise of a centuries-old tradition, in the married women who would never speak the name of their spouses.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise it was just before chatted; another chose to let the whole pent frustration against him and his family by using it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an urold Brauch, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband called a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas put them in his head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">A different club member decided to do it with dinner before the entire family.</seg>

<seg id="1513">Raw materials reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the carrying out of the zinnoberred dot at the forehead, which indicates the spouse:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the carcinch red point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs and I heard him to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not been fully resolved with it, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose, even to take him in some days.</seg>

<seg id="1522">In recent months, for the first time in their life, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and commanded about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been linked with some things, for example like our identities on our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they happen.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have taken only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them the okay, but some wanted a salvah-spa, a wide shirts over a trousers, wear; they have not dreamed.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much argument and discussion on the advantages of one's own clothes, morals joined with the Saris and much more, courageous mini their own pair of curtas (Upper shirts) into a discussion, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they have decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and raw materials is certain that they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">At the question whether in the five months have already been changed since their first discussion club, Raini confirmed that things are slowly coming to roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened then again to the name of their spar.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it still, but only if they are alone and are not part of other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their spouses; only one or two women are now carrying zinc at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the fogging for more freedom of movement or the own clothes-election - at the end of a hard to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and other people about it reports, what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear silly, as Singapore is recognised as an independent state in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be considered a city in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark also triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Prosecution association of the State New York, the Minister expressed that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He's support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether new York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">Blog Cavalierio addressed the Minister of Justice to rotate its logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and distopies to create this valuable country, you can say that we may not be a country at all.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, wessen the country?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defends the idea that Singapore will be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old body reappears from the authoritarian leaders who have to be democrats, abandoned the twisted logic, since it adapts better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week, Shangrgam's reaction was given answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarmac with non-responses of rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shangrgam to clarify his opinion because it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a little difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, in which country is ours...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangrye would take the trouble to clear this point unless he was paid up to be part of the city's government.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By sending a comment on the blog, he pointed to the reviews that one should begin to read the whole co-magazine of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam better, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the description.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "as he said Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "be as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore was so unequal even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He tried Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of those cities did a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "as he said, Singapore" "" "be no country," "" "he has not meant to be in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shangrgam, who makes as leader of a here- generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am over what the Justizers of Singapore said to be very embarrassed...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew about Lee Kuan Yv and the members of the old Garde, what I expected - if I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shangrgam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts, and I am not even sure whether he's really believed to be correctly involved and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review Discounts the faking points of Shanmugams Argumenten:</seg>

<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today we live for the largest part of Russians and noses in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are called in Abchasias well as ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were more than 10,000 people living here today, today there are only a few hundred people in these spirit-cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the District was 16.000 people, after having barely risen across a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, Europe or Latin America, some places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the mexican town of Tapachula, situated on the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-olds, a little woman with a corals-pink Brill and goldcoloured earrings in Teddyb√§ren-form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez and was born there in Tapachula and has grown up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 Euros the night sleep in simple rooms, with figures, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the forestroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ram√≠rez, the people tells in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ram√≠rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to decline any anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them to hospital when they are sick, they purchase them medication they can't pay them, they massaged them with a balm that scored from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a jog moustache) posizes with Concepci√≥n Gonz√°lez Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Brack.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," respond with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very fondly.</seg>
<seg id="1921">It has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, the hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other waymen from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He relates that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together the circuit, and that the Africans already speak to Whatsapp of Mrs. Ram√≠rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">How many of his immi-companion has lived in Brazil before, and worked as a building workers upon site construction of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weakened, he began his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa for months now: he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Buffy friend to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ram√≠rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," says he smiling. "we will always be in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ram√≠rez tells us that their guests are often sending text messages, if they are gone to grab them or to report their over the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but their guests has taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ram√≠rez is known here very well, but it is not the only radio for migrants to travel through tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city there is a dead-sac to Jes√∫s Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valenzuela and his family are migrants in her small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Buffy is to be sold at many African migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar spent the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cook site outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela illustrates that he knows what the guests do through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "told me." "" "I experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border into the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was instructed to a raid on his work place from the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Jos√© Antonio Cordova Mel√©ndez tells me that he was flown out in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to squeeze him out of money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and a well-known, an all-known, has offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is anything again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the ways the passengers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a majority from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ram√≠rez seems happy that their house is full but it is also nostalgically, because of those that have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she sang in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hairstyles that you made a rally in his grandchildren, some photos of her grandchildren and lots of travellers, young and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad, while she presents them briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya'fueron," they repeated every time. "they are already gone."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A Check-Point f√ºr Personal Communications Equipment in Xinjang by Twitter-User</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are compelled to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10 received the mobile users in Tianshan District of the Urumqi a mobile phone notifications in which it indicates the District government, a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication it is said that the app" "" "should prevent the app to get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But col√≤nated the authorities use the app also for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app to have exchanged messages with a private Weeks group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police agree that the app would determine the sources and distribution of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "damaging information" including videos, images, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for kids and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockade pornographic web-sites, from online fraud, tropical and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filter for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable the" "" "government actors or even hacker to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it from it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While the reports of digital censorship in China tend to focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dusurers for those who live in remote, displaced ethnic minors like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To rest unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routincal Internet downturn.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Das auf Twitter-based Media-Outlet "Images from the mainland China" (the retailer offered in China "), the censored news in China showed photos of a Checkpoint, at the police officers the residents had checked that they had the monitoring app installed.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian authorities make sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are having a checkpoint with a device without this software they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a proposal for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have compelled the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity through the surveillance technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from the country of China" (retailers of the loan agreement...) also published a Nanwang Product description, resulting from which the software can lift the password to a Windows operating system and therefore get unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang your computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang become an electronic handpiece.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may possibly be a reaction to the instructions of the city's party Council to minimize the circulation of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government agencies, authorities and the associated facilities, including universities and research organisations, are obligated to follow the Cybersecurity Office's instructions when running their computers and communication equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned this new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their "personal ID cards, mobiles, external drives, portable disks, notebooks, and media channels" register by local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously any "terrorist videos" to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" however. however, this action hurt the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives it penalties for a whole series of other possible failure, including those who relate to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Gulf Rapper Emsallam Hdaib remembers about the rights of LGBTQ + -Community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends much of his time in the inside; sometimes he swans his canvas, time to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine patented lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the chief economist of his family house, which joined them in 1967; the year, in whom Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family were forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faced the conservative majority and questioned their old views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression by art and rapid music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, who often cleared together with topics such as Oriental alism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Arab world. all these issues are also found not only in his hometown Amman Relevanz but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to according to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib looks at Hdaib as someone who is not restricted in his mind by boundaries, and he can suffer according to his own statement with the people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admits it openly, he paves a special circumcision against the US-American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war-areas, something that can be done with his identity as "Palestinian piewed the second generation - so he referred to himself even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think because of my own life conditions," stressed Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think that, because I am a man," while he dissolved into water Nescaf√© in two cups. it is the divine month of Ramadan; in that time it is intended for Muslims from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The present law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensory hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of hot coffee and the scissing of the Kent cigarette smoke in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when looking at a glance into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, one simply avoids things to do basic things - like in the public during Ramadan water - to not end in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the home of the Jordaniens brought a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila cancelled, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and be the main reason for concert deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokeswoman in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was "" "" said "" "" because of the sexual orientation of the firm. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many affirm that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism, which poses the altest legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou, Leila, the MEP," "" "progressive signatures of human rights," "", "which still has chosen" "" "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not simply be silly-seized of the rhetoric, but in fact a more and more evident reality in Jordan. this statement clearly expresses the work in Hdaibs Werk clearly.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib's traditional gender equality to corbe, by embored his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a clearly drunk, unfamiliar woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'Ehrenmorde' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch said that the number of Honorary morde in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still creating that Jordan has not yet escaped institutional infrastructure to support women who were victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for interruption lasting control from the year 1954, women who are exposed to risk-owned violence, "insically held in prison," and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee by the family is needed that the woman has nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known, also not shy from subjects claiming in his country long to taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib stands that his work is political, however he believes that he is his music, which is full of exponations on sexuality, freedom and freedom of expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was conceived in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is again on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs which are in the core politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it too."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words, "that can be" - be it faith or not-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that there is hardly anyone in Jordan regarding the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on gender equality for LGBTQ + -individuals were still highly censored.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Sordian OnlineProgramme Roya, in order to memorize that his comments made from the context was torn and his opinion has been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but there was only one working version," says he.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib weaves open for the arabic LGBTQ + -community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals do not speak of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nues, a poet of the eighteenth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nues, who was to work later once on behalf of the caliper, to write in the 8th century openly about homosexuality, why does Jordanier not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite Kingdom, it is nothing new that the government has been sanctioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Still recently, in January 2017, the schedule competencies and members of the school association, with the reason, they would have expressed themselves on comments in social media and critical of problems related to the corruption that are deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the gig Hdaibs in mind is that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structurally changing in the next generation of the Jordan Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now managed to die Mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks very slow, bedtime and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the present society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, of a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He dreams not only of this, his work as far as Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is spoken by means of music, art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, partitions and manmade democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">We suspected that it is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory means that the strongholds ran over more than one thousand years, and from a time come, in the armies of the West Japan in the Northeast marched in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to catch some great seats, so we got a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>

<seg id="2157">I look at it for a long time the Meguro Gajoen: two stronghold have just been seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebo Festival is the only truth - and a breathtaking way of spending his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normalbrangers in the experienced hands of hairstyles that can form these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles which go to the outer limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the Friseure "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2182">The article will be published here within the framework of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we just write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who come across to bring affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question went by the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo P√°rraga by the Young-Youth Foundation is no longer of his head and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliaci√≥n (Letters for reconciliation), which young people get to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was a place of a historic event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had formed a peace agreement with the guerrilla WARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signatories of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian President Jos√© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There is still a long way before the ColombianWoman, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla warricks, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric, and around the clock bore their weapons, now they have to be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn has got accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases deep hate against guerrillas, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians would like to join and in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this exactly what did they do: until now, thousands of young people wrote letters - love messages for former guerrilla warrims to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for any former guerrilla warricks - which should then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters for reconciliation was created at the world summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, which took place in Bogot√° in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak briefly with Kailash Satyarthi who was granted the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2196">That explained that we love the people we love, by Valentine's Day thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He left, he told him to share his love with people this year, who needed most pressing.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "in this way, the plan, letters, full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life." "" "letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story into a common history of peace." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to date, more than 2000 ters were accumulated in the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major towns of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medell√≠n, Barranquilla and Bogot√°.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN in the Caldono region in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city's administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation to transfer my letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC fell on how they used it earlier to increase the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of sub-protecting people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political science student Manuela Jim√©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an assistant of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we handed down the letters, a former fighters led through the camp of the guerilla-fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut that lived in the guerrilla warricks), I saw a guerrilla warrior which wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL granules, a deadly weapon in the thorn berry.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I still spoke to him and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing now?" "" "he answered," "" "I responded to a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so nice, that is why I responded to that. "because I suddenly enjoyed the tears over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I awoke it completely and sat down next to the granites.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, the only chance to preserve him and his six brothers before hunger. "I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society that is waiting with open arms in us.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the overclocking, students and some leaders of the FARC came together on a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC were already in secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "therefore the leaders of the FARC, the history of the organization, its ideals and gave an insight into their views over the peace process:" "" "for many years we have experienced the social injustice from the state across the Colombian people." "" "now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help create society in this country." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for the purpose of this scale, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who have never had found hearing and had no voting right, and to recognize that people who have often seen as monsters and even hassen had learned even people with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, does me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - also who have killed and have so much damage to bring us something, and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo Gonz√°lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Dar√≠o de Jes√∫s Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columtesters was made, that after the drafting peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are prepared to access the weapons, to rise up and to protest for their rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we at the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology - they belong to all those that dream of a country in the war.</seg>

<seg id="2242">It follows the translation of an article, written by our partner Aida Mirmacsumo and its first release on the OC Media website.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Homosexuals and queer people living in the Caucasus region, are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination, physical and sexual violence and extortion.</seg>
<seg id="2244">With horrors, activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of pregnant men in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed by a diamois value over the local LGBTQ community does not occur only overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared with us some of their experiences and talked to us about what happens in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ-law in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines since reports released, indicating the disappearances, torture and killing queer men in the Republic of thematised.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist in Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya inneta; they cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities, the evocative queer men strongholds, and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transversine, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Even since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they grew, you became aware that Chechnya had no more secure place for them, why they moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of chechens had experienced by the sex-meeting of their landlady, the hunt was opened to Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life she moved to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in an human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that somebody needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a transversine that arose in difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, he was a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents, and spread them anywhere on the internet, using my telephone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there is no more men in Chechnya who can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made by the very fhatsapp the lap.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was there, I heard a few shopping street from the backseat of my car, I heard a male hat:" "" "here is a gift for you by your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned out, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing hurting.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard one sentence, but this time on the Chechen:" "" "how long will you still want to honor the family, du Schandfleck?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I knew the person not.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that there was a young man, no thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women got it all and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a nurse.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two mooges in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulances, you were placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name in it, but the doctor sold and put me in the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">So I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a kangkascher name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful of me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a alpspace.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was attended by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to return to Chechnya to prove that everything was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me, I had to prove it by walking up without the streets; others wanted me to read on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body-size C - what should I say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke to my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a monster to the world that not only has your family, but the whole of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she lay down on his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and delivered them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with a flashing window washers and a plate sign with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened was clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My rights-rights-friends overlooked the hedge diagrams - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how have you been flying?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not grasp what it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without notice, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived on and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think about, you believe in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">You already know our people in which you know. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it" "" "to show you" "" "it is the number 115" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you have any questions about your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"" "however, we do not talk about the sex-separation, but this is a tabby topic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kissasian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, this secular barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually give to my efforts to look like the person who reminds them of their past - that is, in my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who are dortations?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone, the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during the Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not shut down a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they most likely invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end are demanding proof that the so called "honour" has experienced by blood Genevtuung.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also now still missing men in these secrets?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there was not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then especially those who have no rich relative or who were dropped by their relatives in order to establish them Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there so that one can present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be reprisoned it will show their bodies on television and claim, they would have attacked some village or a military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, they are purposed to radicalize themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I was looking at someone who was killed in the two and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown the beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was no news since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have simply taken them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person himself was with them as these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports yet. we suspect that such activities are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not allow this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, "had taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair up long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that early in 2003 I was already known quite big, as I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was defined, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia was originally planned to lead us to "civil civilisation," ultimately brought us back to the Stoneage.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Faria law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were awesome, I had the colored eyelashes, carried the tube-jeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the Scharia has never made me a hair for me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, mainly at weekends, quite a group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several B√§nke stood, and the whole town knew: they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spote does not say about the disaster of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if they make a lot of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you because they felt, they are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never belated me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be remembered?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he started talking about morality on TV.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but priority over the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who had previously deposited and gellaughed, viewed you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">That's why I still operate as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a type Psychologin.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacup, I beginite them to hospital and help them get Essenskarten.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I haven't been a penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I turned away.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims, and would like to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you have a Hijab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature that has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">That is exactly the same as Chechens who want to tell you with foam before the mouth, that there is no bumps on them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Those Dagestany who have the cabaret, who have the Russians also; on the entire planet there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to me so what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims living in the mosque and during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think at Transistence to men who love men, and they believe that you changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truction.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be precise, different ways of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not, if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be here so personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region where a major part of the Arab Ahwazi community live in Iran was shaken by a far-reaching economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to ride their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arabic Ahadz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi-Monarchy took over power over 1925, and 1925 extensive efforts made an end to complete autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahadz region there are some of the largest in Iran-coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the widest and valuable commercial space for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slow, and the local population gets only little of this wealth.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with the feminism, even with the intersectional."</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is an revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afrof√©minas. the article was the subject of several conversations in which many different positions expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not feminists, react many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well thought, scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminists, and why we are generally all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For instance, women nowadays still earn less money in spite of equal education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women should come across a glude earlier or later in diverse areas of life, and that discrimination is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is conscious and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I am double and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin colour, racism, on black CIS women, on black transists women, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, if I mentioning, in which way we've ever been dispersed, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have been silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they agree that women - all women - should come together to uplift "their voices and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing," to reach the equality (some) women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to speak about sexualised violence an institutionalised violence, there are racist violence that we are exposed to black women in question.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or in addition, that black women and women of other ethnicities and spaces of origin make less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girl and girls are referred to as a migration background of the school as white girl, due to obvious integration issues.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with a migration background to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership has to suffer as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand I want to incorporate all men, all the men, and all human beings, all individuals, and on the other hand I can relate to a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands to take into account unjustices in their thinking that relate to the sex as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, who led me and countless other black women ever and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner wept in 1851 in their speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also raise myself to sustain an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanized and marginalized beings.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refrain myself to join groupings which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to advance its egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to paralyze white women about the importance of cutting of skin colour and gender. because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different homes and limit themselves from the white feminism, is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself full and completely of feminism that was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of working for me a white-feminist paradigm that is stubborn that intersectionality is celebrated as a New phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana. (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can conquer ourselves, that we can defend ourselves on our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered all the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will call immediately separatism and exclusion, please inform you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm existence I have existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of the paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of the paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weird-women) that reported on the violence of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the people affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissary said Ada B√°ez, that she has nothing to do against Luis Balbuena, her excreatic, who could have become violent for violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relation was some time passed and the police said, their testimony would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another wife Balbuena showed for misrepresentation, although the accredited display of Ada B√°ez is nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman drew her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are displayed at all times, they do not generally receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who misuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who will admit, victims of violence to be victims of violence at all in case of law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 strokes and Statisticen2 Unvisible abuse and a legal system, which is not on immt3 Paraguay. good approach, substandard implementation and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really negotiable, says Myrian Gonz√°lez, researcher at the Centro de Documentaci√≥n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports that do not even show to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, at the district council, 9600 ads went for domestic violence. at 70% of this it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads come to the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements because of domestic violence among the peace shops, and here were 86% of the display of women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically misleading, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show not the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to information from the paraguayan women Ministries Ana Baiardi actually, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "to each woman who reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychical misrepresentation, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On each woman, who reimburse because of physical abuse, come to two women who do not do this, "they stated at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's genocide is not an own crime, the criminal enforcement authorities can not be appropriately documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or ex partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone until August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women's infanticide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay was documented in at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or ex partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence accompanied by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that is not doing nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Br√≠tez has became the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she was named him all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning they didn't want this, but still there. this should be forever repent.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana 28 is 28 years old, and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychological violence of her turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognizing the most severe forms of violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I've read earlier about it, I always thought that only women have happened to be subverish, because they are deceiving themselves by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name to name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had lost her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked the rhetorish, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refuse to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long about Carlos and left him past.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos which was not from Paraguay, fought nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner swelled them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te creo (" "" "I think" "" ") which consists of women who are all victims of abuse all in any way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listening to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Their wealthy partner finally managed to convince them that they were worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias advertisements in the authorities remained without a result and also by their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It conducted a process against its former partners who developed into an untransparent legal struggle between Paraguay and her country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, substandard implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not used.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, provides great problems with the application of laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the paraguayan parliament which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# F√ºrth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-immigration) are part of a campaign on Twitter, supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law foresees, Femizid to explain and to punish a standoffence and tougher to punish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legality in some points has been altered in order to also win the proposals for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions will be paving the way for decriminalisation of abortions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay and punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had envisaged, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) treatment costs which have to carry out the victims of violence at the present time, if they simply have the display and wish to receive a secure accommodation, to surrender the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri arguing that the law does not effectively be if the lawmakers do not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay the abuse as part of human relationships is seen.</seg>

<seg id="2552">The rule of the sultan is characterized by the harsh efforts of security forces, especially of domestic violence, public freedoms, including press freedom, and defenders, and human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers, and other activists, to intimidate and to be held.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities on human rights systematically and prevent citizens, including activists, including their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on newspaper Azamn, its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses an urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need for medical research there are two reasons: to a lack of global health care, many medicines and vaccines that meet the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the poorest countries have far greater than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is conducted by African scientists themselves, with the development of own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Education in Zambia School for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRs).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he searched himself on HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the sambassador of the health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of media via this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. at the moment I support the sambic National program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with labels tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Moreover, I have just stepped up a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic testing testing for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important topics of scientists in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basics of basic research. we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being Macher.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support arrive from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult it is to find appropriate scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go back here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure do not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all age groups.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer sciences, Big Data, research of the space, the health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: may you describe the pros and cons of Life as a scientist in Africa in western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often there are the limited speed, things to do and the scarce access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system, that journals are only accessible to payment (the so called "Paywall") is also limited to the amount of availability information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">"" "from the USA to India: how" "" "Open Source" "" "seed producers to change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been founded in the United States for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant, which cultivated by NASA astronauts in the outer space and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years Morton has been working only by his own imagination and the question how many salachers can get sick, bounds.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But in the beginning of the 2000 he noted that more and more salads were patented, and therefore he could not use them on the breeder.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents exist not only for individual sorts, but also for certain properties like resiliking of diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">More and more such patents have been registered in more than ever more plants like cereals or cardboard boxes. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are responsible for food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, but now it takes longer because its work is becoming more and more complicated by more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like being in a river a rock-rock, in order to addling the whale.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breed of tradition," "" "says he." I think that this patents go on Salads. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they held the court, no one can breed any new salatory, because all the characteristics are already patented. "he makes them as good as possible and attempts to solve those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful, however, and strives to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he has also joined a movement in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeding)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Centre ISS have red Roman salat of the Sorte Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten there. there, if plants can be cultivated in the universe.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like this would be the movement out of the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" Software, providing alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into life to make sure some plant types and gene will not be protected as intellectual property and so are used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, we can commit US-breeding to others that could freely use the seeds from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds, to breed, in order to breed such own varieties, and it doesn't immediately sow - two aspects associated with many plant patente respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi boards are control over the seeds and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds, such as seeds, rights of farmers, control over the nutritious system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to utilize the latter not or only little by bred seeds with natural resiliency.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "Open-Source" movement did not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants might be patented whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability," he says good, locally and sustainably productive vegetables, as such as being offered on farms, should also know that the way is bred on how this vegetables is bred.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition is not possible without any seed's sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative will continue to commit to others their seeds as well. by contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardised because the anti-pool is due to the increasing intellectual property rights based on plant material, which is therefore always available reduced, disadvantageous.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive President of Ossi, has engaged in her doctorate with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. it found that about a third of all monottenacity is protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either not or only scared.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates still not, but experts like Luby suggests that custom-built plants such as wheat has been patented in even bigger styles are patented as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they can specifically identify properties - from those who improved their flavour or colour through to those due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are reduced by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions change by climate change are much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-speaker in Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for monthly activities. with a total of four contender and co-operation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company will ignite for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts that intellectual property other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietiology innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that can be followed once the patent expires." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection would be inhibited so innovations not, but it promotes the public and know-how to the public. "</seg>

<seg id="2668">And if you are waiting for such a long time to cultivate on plants that are adapted to the altered environment conditions, the fight has already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general public and we should continue to stay, "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>

<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are), but smaller than Monsanto are patents and own patents, create it with most smaller seeds, even without patents to survive - either do they reject the patent or they keep it worthwhile for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed itself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs about lock is very old, however, has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi. and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is however for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of an executive condition; a detachment, an abandoned murder, pretenure at the national Security Council, the Corksgiving blogs as well as any other web site, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not vain. in other words, my words have an impact, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles in order to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>

<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a quadrant video, which was shared on Facebook, Oct√°vio Guedes, the editor of the newspaper stated that this decision does not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war of war in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Department of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the article, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war is discriminately, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then ask questions to cover.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based upon information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aims is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Have the name "war" more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil Purpose the journalist to call force the violence as a war. in their opinion a justification of failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibilities with the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military prepares in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education, and historic and self-pleasing lect of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war between the different Mujahedin groupings had broken, which had conquered the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Just at this time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central America to the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say it back then she knew she would not see her son a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning the boy should abort.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the locks.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Dul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezeki's leader of Hezb-e-Wahdat had just been murdered by the Taliban, and a lot of Hazara felt worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban fighters were ever closer to their hatred.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his flight, Asharaf was found in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal crab for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little salary, and walked in Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country along with other refugees and sluggish sawing with mortar that were heavier than him, in order to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," reminded of Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (afghan refugees) lived in an abandoned building on the jobsite, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service and no heating there. we mounted nylon in front of the open windows, so that we can't refreshed at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for travel to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing in the sea he lit shipwrecks and strangled on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities were rejected his asylum application, AONaf 2002 came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Asharaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church, which distributed twice the day eating in unskilled.</seg>
<seg id="2897">True that Italy due to relatively high of the will quotas is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers are in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil liberties Union for Europe writes the system "suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of the asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 "exceptional performance centres." this is an improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and non-prepared staff. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law asylum seekers will only be assigned to an insurrection centre if they officially have an application on Asylum - indicating after the registration of the asylum seekers can still go on a monthly journey.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who have no money for an accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it is also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his miserable life-wille helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in construction, Asharaf reached its entire savings through the founding of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a bootable.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject to the documentation "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The movie was awarded to Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">"" "" "" "much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles." ""</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of people in the company were created, including taileries, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea to its restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the chef will be largely refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The restaurant's menu is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes, the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashark's goals set far beyond the Italian gastronomic and retail trade and aim back to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily, if I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for peasants out of the poorest provinces in the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent the half of society and have to get the same opportunities as anyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf narrods also plans to open a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservatives. "thus, they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneurs was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but at the end are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey itself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
