it is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize at the Pul@@ itzer Prize .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally chosen by Americans .
it &apos;s another chapter that should make a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , where the CIA had literally ev@@ acu@@ ated up for an atomic bom@@ b .
if that mad sounds , you can read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know , whom the chapter did not fall ?
the US Government .
for almost 10 years the government has been chosen against R@@ isen and urged him to name its alle@@ ged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the patterns of the government , wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers to judge and journalists .
according to the first constitutional , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they are not able to protect the identity of the Mu@@ y that they do .
so when the government headed off , he did something that many bra@@ ve Rep@@ orter did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 R@@ isen has lived with the risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , though they have been campa@@ ign@@ ing for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and springs can always hide more and less .
instead of issu@@ ing and ending R@@ isen to the statements , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his telephone calls are secre@@ tly worried ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel @-@ wise , with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA @-@ wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers and risk factor .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama spoke in his attack , wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers to protect . but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments to face before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem particularly because the government has too much of its work than secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ blo@@ wers to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work in the game that is being protected by the first constitutional project because the government has more and more possibilities to sp@@ ur all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology has allowed the government to handle the rights of re@@ por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can take this from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness .
today there are communication software , which had not existed , as R@@ isen has written its book and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source of treatment system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by the internet famous , which was developed by us called Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is today approved by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I work , developed further .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news page , just like the Washington Post .
you can upload documents or send information such as every usual contact form .
these will then be encryp@@ ted and stored on a server which only has the particular news .
so the government may no longer describe secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments from all over the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
it is in us to make sure that not only technology denomin@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to surrender mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers .
who wants to know about Miss@@ s in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental processors , the alarm for contamin@@ ated water of Flin@@ t . or a pilgrimage @-@ Insider , who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover their crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data le@@ ak of the story published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed &quot; &#91; what is that ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ade Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness &#93; . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ade Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; this week we were made of messages about a check of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s so@@ lic@@ ed dressing ( s ) Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimp@@ se into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an an@@ onym@@ es company . can you register it ? &quot;
we see actually the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works .
this already resulted in a very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has come back .
also , there have been reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad brief@@ ing companies in tax hav@@ ens has .
it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of child coll@@ ages , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others that are nervous about the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agency se or a John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ Romans .
it seems cr@@ ying from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we address what ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their property in tax hav@@ ens , and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , this disclosure is phenomen@@ al .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ al their wealth -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seems very conf@@ using this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine a sail@@ or @-@ man@@ ger scene .
so one has a company in another company , in another company what makes it nearly impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is .
I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US .
pres@@ um@@ ably because there has been no prominent Americans , who came in this disclosure , this sc@@ andal .
now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle according to which these tax hav@@ ens operate , has Mos@@ pack Fon@@ sec@@ a less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ase from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would look much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is that you need more information in some US countries , need to provide less information to set up a company than to get a libr@@ arian .
this kind of in@@ consistency in the US has allowed employees to sal@@ ute workers from debt to school children .
it has allowed to be contrac@@ ted , particularly an@@ random investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how it looks like this in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent an emb@@ ank@@ ering revenue to the offices of 13 arri@@ val@@ ing companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as a African Minister , who wanted to bring ev@@ oc@@ ative money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked it that all the proposals made for a lawyer made our investig@@ ator suggestions as he could transfer his money .
these were all pre @-@ minist@@ ries . none of these lawyers took us to clients as clients , and of course they got not handed over money to someone else . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer , who has subj@@ ected to our co@@ vert proposals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leading issue , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules in order to ag@@ gra@@ v@@ ate this kind of behavior .
this may sound very tri@@ b@@ ulation , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever be changed , as if it will always be the rich and powerful ones .
but as sal@@ v@@ aged optimum , I see that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen commitments to more transparency which concerns the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU captured in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really lies behind firms in Europe and who controlled it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not explain the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means of use to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need ex@@ ecutives in business who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ consistency is not good for business &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and commit themselves to ending this kind of in@@ transparent laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparent , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing , finally finish .
this is the story , as I was almost dra@@ ined once and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ zer .
one day after I had completed my design study , I made a Hinter@@ höfe .
one type in the red Maz@@ da left and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip around the country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you slip until today night ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what is I now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
now I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him yet ! he says he would go for peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of an D@@ ress .
this is a small luggage space !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a li@@ mat@@ rat@@ ze . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a voice in my head said , &quot; E@@ h , how please ? &quot;
at night I was then in bed , I star@@ red at the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what I dropped me there ?
a wild sea sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I climb@@ ed up from the bed , on the ti@@ p@@ point to the door , and shut my sleep @-@ door .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , is based in his class@@ room . he is now teachers .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stran@@ ger , actually friends , who were just waiting to be discovered ?
people on my air matt@@ resses to sleep , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates moved out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design Conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it to be afraid of fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I talked about how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and founded so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air @-@ bed and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we saw our last guest and the door into the castle fell , gaz@@ ing Brian and I felt .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent ?
the things came rolling .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept for it .
we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website where people will post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors can be closed when you visit .
over the Internet they can then invite the foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would stop .
but they do not , but .
nobody who still is at comfort , would invest in a business that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we as children all have learned that foreigners are dangerous .
if you have a problem , one stands on the things that you can well . we could des@@ ig@@ ate .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and Hap@@ tik -- it is the overall experience .
we learned how to design@@ ate objects but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a fun test , which degree trust we asp@@ ed .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your coming @-@ time .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I want you to un@@ lock your phone .
type your un@@ lock phone to your left seat .
this quietly approach to panic which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts are feeling when they open the first time the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS messages , you see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locking phone of a fore@@ igner in your hands ?
most are the responsibility .
so feel most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason , our company can exist .
only time is who has actually Al Go@@ res mobile ?
could you announce to Twitter that he serves as president of the president ?
you can now return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would have been revealed once again with his name ; if he told he wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children would be called ?
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ essm@@ ents that are all said : &quot; he can truly be very good un@@ wi@@ red hand@@ held ! &quot;
how would you then feel when you &apos;d like to submit your phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence vital .
at first we did some things wrong .
it was hard for folks to give negative evalu@@ ations .
finally we decided to wait for both the host and the guest who handed over their jud@@ g@@ ments before we put them online .
last week we have discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how most likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are related to age and residence .
very surprising , we trust the people most , which are most like us most .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is exciting when you added to the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essm@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have less than three departments , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , changes everything .
a good reputation sti@@ pul@@ ous simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes .
furthermore , we experienced that confidence is dependent on how much you are reasonably priced .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell me a lot , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we had not reck@@ oned with was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dism@@ iss these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless efforts of our team .
third , a need that previously did not been covered .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are also times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ author@@ ised part@@ ys or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I have worked on customer service in the customer service . all calls joined to my mobile phone .
I stood on fore@@ front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it hur@@ ts , if I just think of it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further .
fortunately , from the 123 million overnight stays there had only one fraction per a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people trusted each other rightly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when trust is working , it can be mar@@ vel@@ ous .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host went him to hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who pr@@ uning due to their own activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know at all .
you drive to hospital by car , if you die , and wait while you get a pass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over .
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
and of course not every time goes off .
but these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I wonder@@ ed :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is about an economic trade .
but it is now simply to call &quot; le@@ ase &quot; but the cause is not justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people set a part of themselves and that changes everything .
if you travel today , it is fast compar@@ ing with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place that would be visited , a group there would wait to complete a group there and show a bar in a bar pent@@ ine area where you have never heard before ;
or when you could learn cooking from a five stars cook ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up with each other ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would share the thought of shared each day ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and shame .
in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces that were included in the government .
were now offered by residents . students who were looking for a lead ,
were sent to people whose children were moved . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . our platform alone will be a guest of 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries to be guest in a stran@@ ger or even host .
so the idea seems to be as crazy as it was told us .
we did not inv@@ ented the wheel completely .
hospitality was there even earlier .
there has been similar websites in front of us .
so why has just our work ?
apart from luck and tim@@ ing we know that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to reflect every time when a red Maz@@ da goes past .
we of course know that design can not solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we will be able to use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think , if you look at me ?
a cred@@ itors ? a Expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , under@@ ing a brain @-@ under@@ ing , a terrorist attack ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media it represents that look like me .
a study sur@@ rendered that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
most likely people do not speak to their users .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practi@@ cing , spiritual , Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ sted me .
no , not as a hom@@ osex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I chose to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; why oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
the pre@@ stige was : back then it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and although compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to settle a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty .
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have with the basket .
I read it , thought upon , presented in question , doub@@ ted and believed ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and long dedication , deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm always brings me to tears .
I do know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that horri@@ ble morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I just sat in my kitchen , had at the end my breakfast , looked up on the screen and saw the word &apos; E@@ il@@ &apos; . &apos;
there was smoke , planes flo@@ ods in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock changed quickly in indi@@ gn@@ ation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ hadi@@ st &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Zer@@ bom@@ bs Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my god .
not only my country had been attacked , but in the N@@ u , the works of others turned into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States in order to move into a new city and start building studies .
I remember , as I drove myself -- so deep it went down into my seat , and I feared the first time being recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then heard , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations having said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; so@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; need@@ y in good il@@ umin@@ ated areas , &quot; gath@@ er@@ ings you not . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then , it was Friday during that week -- the day where Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings were saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be one destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw this comprehensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who held free to Muslims in the Free .
there were really Bran@@ dan@@ ations on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who had attacked this country , our country attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have defeated the anger of people to the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is to be Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslim and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor to be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor if one can only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , instruc@@ tors and Olympi@@ oni@@ cles .
will make the closing of mus@@ k America safe ?
there may be some parking but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to other faith toler@@ ant observ@@ able , and greater citizens &apos; participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people will actually not be radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
you will be radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
in the Ra@@ dical process , one has found that it is starting online . as Er@@ stes the person can cut off their community , even from their family , so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ur their behavior and its ideology is a tra@@ itor or from faith .
when we want to avoid radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claim@@ ing that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a Mother , as a person , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their destiny , if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim@@ ing their ideology to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you poses a look at it , it does not driving them what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality to let them read these things into scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding be@@ am told me recently a amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radic@@ ally religious leaders .
he said , the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy which had spoken with whom she had spoken , and told her that her anger , her sense of the in@@ justice in the world , she would just bring in trouble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing inspired by nothing and something that could have happened to her anger , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extrem@@ ists who spoke to a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this im@@ am set the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use it for their anger , he showed a constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , preserved them to join the IS .
it was an insight , as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy each day , our thought freedom ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show , when we fear , we happen at least three things .
we are rather accepting a author@@ ised government system , con@@ formity and prejudi@@ ces .
one study shows : if one defines the people &apos;s messages in which negative about Muslims have reported , they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims caught up the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ out of the Iraq war , and out of two elec@@ toral periods .
so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to infl@@ ate the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning @-@ sign .
we may sense it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear sm@@ ote us all .
in the assignment of collec@@ ti@@ vis@@ ence , it is not just about to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was in the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , gr@@ acious man , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a sealed young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Suz@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she ass@@ ass@@ inated , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he f@@ lowed eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or stayed safely at home ?
we conc@@ ise it and for us it was no easy decision , for it went out what America we want to leave to our children : one that would be able to control us by fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s headquarters we went away , with high expression on the mosque .
I took him out and put out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was holding me .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked him and called our guests welcome , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts , faithful and non @-@ believers who have come to join us , but to join us .
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what are you going to choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number sure ?
or are you connecting to those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say those who might be claim@@ ing that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a Memorial with deep dr@@ au@@ ght , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t f@@ ool yourself . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I tend to be as it permits .
by looking at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever performed study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
if people usually appear like an exception , then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for bast@@ ion , is about to become a billi@@ ary business .
monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial ones . it is possible to do this in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ p@@ ouring into our social consciousness , an autonom@@ ous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bri@@ cks . a few years ago she started to fly with rop@@ es .
thanks to connections , air@@ ers reach high speed and acceler@@ ation in the stem area .
you can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
you have learned to bear the burden , to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our objective is to cross the boundaries of the possible in the autonom@@ ous flight .
so that a system autonom@@ ous works , it must be collec@@ tively knowing where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at the E@@ TH Zurich we often use external cameras to find items . that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a family of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room , to determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands will be at the highest E@@ ben@@ . e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
a ground@@ ing that tries to strike two flies with a cap .
like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler , it is efficient in the heat @-@ flight efficient , much more efficient than helic@@ opter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ vation it can float , and thus , it has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of hits is that they react har@@ dy to turbul@@ ence such as wind farms .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which location the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practi@@ cing .
okay .
during our research we often ask basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helic@@ opter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that con@@ fr@@ un it to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots @-@ controlled aircraft have been able to fly @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear bow .
un@@ long discovered , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est remote machine . it was inv@@ ented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no caps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ ps , no further actu@@ ators or roll@@ ers , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , happens in the interior very much , so that it can be st@@ ably able to move and move in space .
nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the slope . to get it to fly there , I have to lay it right .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood to throw it just when all look , is low , so I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in mo@@ g@@ ful , this machine is here , the om@@ ni@@ p @-@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thus , he receives the proper ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is fil@@ med or even as he rotating .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive streams of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly with flying .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
if flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller air equipment .
this turns on clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
if one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance squares .
however , we goes wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited .
we will demonstrate that by doing a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration studied synthe@@ tic cases .
the large number of cul@@ ous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took the usual Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single side weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and let them know with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly secure machine since dr@@ on wants to be on Broadway a flying lamp bul@@ lets .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ di@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the pay is in the development and the creation of the work .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magic our universe is , and that it enables creative , cl@@ og@@ ging si@@ ves to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive intellectual and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
before 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galax@@ ies , two black holes are getting faster , they are turning so the mass of three @-@ ri@@ gs in a t@@ enth@@ s of pure energy around .
these short moment they lumin@@ ous they brigh@@ ter than all the stars along with all the galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but its energy do not put them in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time broad@@ casts himself and the universe was explo@@ ded in Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
arrange the events initially tim@@ est@@ ly .
just 1.3 billion years ago it was just based on the life on earth .
since then , the earth has caused quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rian , people and -- God stand for us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group decided to build a group of particularly bra@@ ve -- R@@ ai Weiss of MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech - a huge laser det@@ ector to seek the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most they stopped for crazy .
but enough people realized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea .
after decades @-@ long development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the laser inter@@ fer@@ omet@@ ar gra@@ vit@@ ational ob@@ servatory .
during the following period the precision of LI@@ GO could substantially increase the recognition of recognition greatly improved .
therefore , we now call it Advanced LI@@ GO .
at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO started up for a final test run by some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commission@@ ing of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ lide black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ ghes : two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ ill Father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all these , for what I had worked , is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ ghes , theoretical physi@@ cist on the MIT . he has been studying Gra@@ vit@@ ational whales from black holes and their ob@@ servat@@ ories like LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a herb in the texture of space and time .
during the shaft of the shaft , the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and into the other .
to illustrate , fac@@ ulty are often leading to the theory of rel@@ ativity often a truly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extend and du@@ sting , stretching and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and disturbed by us during the waves of the waves . the Deh@@ nung of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this is called 20 N@@ ul@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . Dar@@ by , one explained the LI@@ GO staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser det@@ ector , and this is absurd , those length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nuclear nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text on engra@@ ving
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ OD , the hunt for the waves in the following : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are abundant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are dark and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LI@@ GO . Scott holds gladly , LI@@ GO is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : face extracts , the size of your phones .
this is quite handy . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by doing that from multiple points coming around you .
at notes is that different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that will mean a lot for you :
the face of your child about .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is about Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ mer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple photos of objects in the universe with them .
but by looking at changes in the amp@@ lit@@ ude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least , for LI@@ GO the measured frequencies are measured in the audi@@ ble area .
so when we convert w@@ ave@@ pattern in sh@@ all , we can literally hear the universe .
the gravity of listening , can tell us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , what my colleague Scott has very long been employed .
SH : two black , non @-@ rot@@ ting holes , circul@@ ating just : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same p@@ light with an additional key change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u !
it is a kind of movement @-@ key , shaped in the wave form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - heard LI@@ GO : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des sound &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what to hear it , it recognis@@ es this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which will turn around as fast as the ro@@ ds of your bl@@ ender .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ cht@@ ing body in space , one with a mass of 29 Son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 prob@@ es , revol@@ ve each hundred times per second before they col@@ lide .
imagine these forces
fantastic .
and we know of it , because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of LI@@ GO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LI@@ GO leaves a completely new way to explore the universe as they have never been possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this way we can listen to all the lou@@ der and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not visible .
a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mascul@@ ine stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about them about all .
the exciting physical processes happen but at the core , which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron , carbon and si@@ lic@@ on .
we will never get through , because these op@@ ak are .
Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as if there would be more transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see her , since the Big Bang is dist@@ orted by his own light @-@ lights .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to return until the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of whom we didn &apos;t have any idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , LI@@ GO found equal in the first sight of things which we did not expect .
my colleague at the MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this subject : Me : the kind of stars , black holes , how LI@@ GO her ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies from prehistoric times . black holes are so @-@ called for our archaeological work .
LI@@ GO enables us to completely different perspectives on the events in space , to the origins of the stars and ultimately also on how we stem from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is now to be as bra@@ ve as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listening to the noise and the sound of the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need ideas for new ob@@ servat@@ ories -- a whole new generation of ob@@ servat@@ ories on Earth and in All .
because what could be more beautiful than how to lau@@ gh it off yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regardless of whether it made me nervous , bringing me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
I wanted to speak in the public domain ?
no , but yes !
would I be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
I wanted to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , though I feared , my fear was afraid .
my fear , to keep speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes , that deeply changed my life to an unexpected Art . it all started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; kittens . &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kittens , I need milk for my beak @-@ free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new life setting in my family . from there I swe@@ eping me to always play with them as soon as you ask myself , no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I ef@@ fort@@ less myself very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an ast@@ o@@ unding side @-@ effect : only recently , I was actually complete , that the &apos; yes &apos; slogan to play with my children my career saved .
I have a real dream job .
I am Autor@@ in . I think of things , aw@@ akes you to life .
dream @-@ job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream @-@ job .
I create TV . I productive television .
I make television , in large style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for allowing for 70 hours to go out into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program provides hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before .
the book for an episode of a TV channel may lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode alle nine days times four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three episodes , die simultaneously in production , mal four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series is going on on Thursday nights .
all over the world I run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts made by myself , and not only produces , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans to camp and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world burn .
do you know who is still doing this ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream @-@ job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
I say it to you , so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now taking a company , a land or a class@@ room , so that I am talking about my job , so that you don &apos;t just get around on the computer ro@@ b and fant@@ asi@@ ere , and it is right when I say , I understand that it does not work with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything silence -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deeply deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country of nothing .
it is , when I put forces on , as my old I was on a canvas .
as a stroke you have a high tone , lie@@ fe a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cru@@ el and rational , and the best thing is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when the work is well running .
a sum@@ s begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road , I could go on it forever .
many people assume when I declare them the sum@@ s that I am talking about writing , that writing my joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work with television production when I began to work and to work and to work , build and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . sum@@ s up !
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you do not want to be different from the size .
the feeling , not different to be different from size to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
maybe it is the fear of things .
I do not know .
I just know that I did not fail for the failure , and I just know that I love the sum@@ s .
I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more hi@@ ber@@ le boundaries , the more work there are the more things simultaneously , the more I &apos;m watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations they are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , passed , exagger@@ ated , extended .
the sum@@ s stops .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ ama is a single working tit@@ anium .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ omm@@ y will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; kittens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
it is the children of a song .
you are baby @-@ ban@@ anas .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s stopped .
the amount of the engine is pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans @-@ work , 15 hours days , pract@@ ised weekends , no Reu@@ e , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sl@@ ack does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Pre@@ show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and sum@@ s was me .
so what do you do when what you do , the job you love , suddenly turn ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ ash you out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you are working to be a teacher like a ban@@ ker who knows the sum@@ s , one who knows the sum@@ s , and knows how the sum@@ s doesn &apos;t know when the sum@@ s stops , if the sum@@ s stops , who is man then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart ce@@ ases , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress after me is a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , too late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , lean you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no more than two things are aware of :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; kittens . &quot;
it does not name no more &quot; kittens . &quot;
when is that happened ?
I miss it , when I am Titan bin and my sum@@ s bet@@ we@@ ere , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , lean you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we lau@@ gh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding as my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and in the lack of sum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to stop .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country , which I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists @-@ fier@@ y fingers and hum@@ id nuts , delicate voices , w@@ ax@@ le , and the song that let it go to slo@@ gans , or whatever the girl bar@@ k into &quot; The ice cream . &quot;
everywhere , peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me resolve itself .
a mental door goes up and an energy supply comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us stay with the cause .
it is love . it is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the tit@@ anium let@@ ins , which is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m in using broad@@ casts and TV hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
the true sum@@ s is dependent on the love .
the sum@@ s is the stream which comes from the lust for life .
true sum@@ s is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true sum@@ s ignored the pressure of history , which is to en@@ ligh@@ ten tasks , the expectation and the print .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
true sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I am escap@@ ing God the wrong words : for which God told me that I am a Titan Poker ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any kind .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice , unless I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not an@@ ed to me as they work .
the truth is hur@@ ting ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I am always working , because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace as an dah@@ o .
this admission is painful , because what kind of man work better than to be home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; let me honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed , is none of them .
we go around in the garden , before and back , and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and playing ball .
we brake Sei@@ f@@ enb@@ las@@ en .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , ab@@ sent , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always ask for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe fills me .
I play and play , till I ask myself : why have we ever stopped using the game ?
you can also say it ! always tell me if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you will be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my children want to play at most 15 minutes , up to them for them to make something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes there was a puppy or bis@@ cuit .
and speak my teen @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more will not need it .
anyone can get 15 minutes a bit , even to a bad @-@ wh@@ une day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to do .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my wellbeing , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is true to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his soul peace .
it is not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
to play the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what is good to you .
find out and preserve it .
I am not perfect in it . I shoot and I vic@@ tories . friends meet , books I enjoy , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to over@@ take myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not full 15 minutes be crow@@ ned ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the sum@@ s come back in my free time . the sum@@ s then seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without any games .
it takes time but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she ful@@ fills me and my soul . she temp@@ ts me to discover new ideas . I am temp@@ ted to his path again . I take advantage of it to full and love my work again .
I like the sum@@ s , but I love not .
I do not need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... not anymore .
so@@ f@@ enb@@ las@@ en and stick@@ y finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just one part , and so I am so grateful .
it is me s@@ lug@@ g@@ ish that I am a Titan , I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land , which I dis@@ afe , the marathon that I run , the troops , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the real sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this money , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of living in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel precisely this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am Autor@@ in . I think of things I aw@@ akes you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means his dream to live .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said yes &apos; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke , or after an accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very small ability to heal yourself .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was working for Neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
surely they have heard from one of the most prominent , the &quot; low @-@ ir@@ rig@@ ation stimulation . it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain in order to influence the schem@@ atic of the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical feature improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease who suffered severe pain and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a leader and worked in the emergency day and night .
often , I accom@@ od@@ ate patients with skull @-@ deer @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ mas , the brain goes off and the skull pressure are increasing .
to save lives , you have to decrease the skull pressure .
actually you sometimes have to remove a part of bra@@ ked brain .
instead of throwing the bra@@ king brain , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , an bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue cell , comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw him under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , mature cells .
perhaps you are still aware of the speci@@ ology ess@@ ons that stem cells un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ne@@ ath of the brain .
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they get very fast .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells un@@ covered different .
they were slow and after a few weeks they died even .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different .
we needed long to understand where they came .
these cells come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot potato cort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you get 4 % of our big hir@@ und@@ ancy cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know that .
we believe they are taking part in healing of the brain since we find them close to brain injury .
but this is not so certain .
one thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are facing a potential cell source , the bra@@ ins of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic field and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they subsequently mark in the brain to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ im@@ planted them at the Dis@@ placement of the same individual .
we call the autonom@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ im@@ plant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ pose the same cells in a bra@@ ised brain tissue ?
with the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain and we watched that they disappeared after several weeks as if they were taken again , they go back home . the space is already busy , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we add an injury to and re@@ im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed away to mature ne@@ neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch below the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re@@ im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we stri@@ pped in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain l@@ esi@@ on ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual work@@ book task .
they had to take p@@ ellets of a tray .
they did so very well .
as they had achieved a stable level of skill , we recorded in the motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex in the hand@@ cl@@ ing area .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move her hand anymore .
just as it would happen in people , they didn &apos;t recover spont@@ ane@@ ously , to some extent , just as after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to relax with the help of plastic brain mechanism . they relax at some degree , just as in the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left they see the monkey , which grew spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can take about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not that precise and not so fast .
now see when we re@@ im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that we were very exciting for us too .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can make them free@@ ze and later use .
we can use them in other new rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson .
but our dream still is to im@@ plant them on humans .
I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne which is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that even now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who may need that . &quot;
I in any case .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at human .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two k@@ ilo@@ grams of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
JB : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
JB : this is difficult to say .
firstly , it depends on the admission of the clinical trial .
will it take us the authority to start it soon ?
then one must perform this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform and evaluate treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to use this on a multi@@ centralized study .
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . JB : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them naturally .
we see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant , which it is in reality , but as our inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an un@@ changing feeling .
we believe capitalism leads to democracy inev@@ it@@ ably .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big after@@ no@@ ons in Beijing have shown beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic .
in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us in Europe .
earlier this year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect austerity policies which were produced in Greece .
at this moment I thought there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my dis@@ su@@ ed friends who would say that democracy would be abol@@ ished when something would change .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ v , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save ourselves , but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies become fit , our future d@@ us@@ hed and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Sh@@ oul@@ den@@ berg , who casts its long shadow over the U.S. , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the school @-@ mountain ,
but only a few recognize its constra@@ ints .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , is too anxi@@ ous to invest there , where it would be productive and income may be brought in by which one could produce the debt @-@ mountain , and also all those things could produce that humanity urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the last 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 billion dollars is invested in all the well @-@ producing goods , such as industrial installations , machines , offices , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 billion dollars of US dollars for much money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tr@@ illion US dollars , which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions are around , and absolutely nothing did except to mo@@ wer the flan@@ k and the property prices .
thus debts and non @-@ productive capital form the twin summit , which cannot be eliminated from the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe . therefore , a low demand power@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who is out of fear , the prophec@@ y of the O@@ rak@@ el could be true that his son would kill him if he grows ,
un@@ certain the circumstances cause this cause that o@@ edi@@ pus kill him fatal .
this is my ha@@ unts with capitalism --
its exce@@ ed@@ ingly sophisticated capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to provide particularly all the technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
so democracy is the solution ?
I believe already . but before we continue , what do we understand by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the corporate form , in which the open air and the poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy of course closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
it would however be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these ti@@ col@@ lars .
the decision of the ath@@ arian democracy was and is that she has entered the working poor and not only has the right to freedom of speech , but rather important and decisive that she has the right to appro@@ ving political decision with the same vo@@ icing in matters of government officials .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long kept --
like a cand@@ le that is very bright it is also rapidly spread out .
however , our present liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , on the free citizen , concentrated and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for the ruling class .
the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was sing@@ led to politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone was made .
in our present democr@@ acies , since the timing of which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two are taking place by the economy and depri@@ ves them .
wonder why the politicians are not as much as previously ?
it is not due to a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because it is possible to be in government today and yet not in power , because the power of politics is w@@ anders into the economy and separated the areas .
I mentioned my ha@@ unts with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is something like a flock of prey , who so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are under@@ fed , dec@@ im@@ ed that they are star@@ ving at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , it is with the economy that increases policy so far . the power of corporations increases , economic goods will grow , the economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are fri@@ gh@@ tened to invest the cash flow of their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; is pushing out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; retain control of such as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t arise very well .
the theory of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can reg@@ ain a stand like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working poor can create !
capitalism is doing it by placing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ ologi@@ ze by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as business and politics are separate areas , automation boo@@ sts the twin summit , the wast@@ ing waste , and the social conflicts lower , as it -- already very soon as I think it will come in countries like China .
we need to re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and thereby consider the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end in a disease @-@ responsible hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that can appear to the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; such as documentation .
the question is not that capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth , will survive --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is dis@@ solved by a D@@ yst@@ roph@@ y , similar to &quot; matrix &quot; , in which machines serve man and to put people their energy into research into the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what does it look , how could it look like these &quot; star Trek &quot; -@@ like u@@ topia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ opy ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you , in a brief outline , some examples .
in the field of companies : ask yourself a capital market in which you earn money while you work and where your capital goes from a job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then , the revenues come from capital and the rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction more between those who belong to the companies , which are not working in them , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , no major g@@ aps between investment and expenses , and ultimately no cont@@ empor@@ aneous tw@@ ins summit .
in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies had a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , created from the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , which is presented in the interest of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is trad@@ ed -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum which matches the trade defic@@ it or trading transfer of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment means .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to realise it .
today we have them , particularly before the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time a Liber@@ ary , in which they preferred individuals , and Marxist , because they are buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , global key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all others it is a world where we can introduce real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ?
the answer depends on how we have to decide .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do not , the technological development is causing so massive decline in the whole economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term st@@ agn@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ ing .
BG : in fact , and now we are at ease too .
Y@@ V : if you are not mist@@ aken , one does not think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein , which said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China , and yesterday at the speakers of the speakers , you said very clearly what you hold from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies , we have a s@@ emb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of the economy is bot@@ her@@ ed , -- the area of economy -- is a completely democr@@ atically @-@ free zone .
in a certain way , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today res@@ embles the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical as concerns the democratic development .
what we can observe now in China , res@@ embles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
China now propose to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells by hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many people might be curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sens@@ ed that that comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you take a look back at the first half of six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
namely , we say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the constant denial that ran down a massive over@@ throwing line by the eurozone and continues to be empha@@ sized the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this denial .
it is right to do . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , inside the European @-@ group , continues to deny the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union .
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what kind of change see you in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future when we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who has been in office after 6 months , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , he has no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
obviously , I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for an extension of the school programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the site of the don@@ ors to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring our government to case simply because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the fail@@ ures supported by the Eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they have carried out a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ don@@ ors who raised us to this policy was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a kol@@ os@@ s@@ ant error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming to someone who lives and loves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for when they are not survi@@ ving , the fre@@ ch@@ ant mur@@ ders will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have disast@@ rous consequences alone for Europe but for the whole world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , for which it appears to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy , most have never heard before , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate moments of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for too many of you .
it goes back to decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production facility from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course , this is a very serious industry .
there are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one .
he must find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right on this corner .
this curve is the rating division of over 2500 TV series on the I@@ MD@@ B website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this evaluation .
when your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , after you saw a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows are like &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve .
Roy Price does not focus on the left side of the turn , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; Tod@@ d@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
it turns out more thoughts on the middle ex@@ cre@@ ment , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight .
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy price is going to risk .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he is holding a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon there are any stuff out there , one can do something right ?
millions of viewers will take a look at these episodes .
however they don &apos;t know they are watching when watching this shows .
you are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything .
you capture when you start the show when you are p@@ auses , which parts you ski@@ ps or once again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce .
in fact they collect the data , process these and it is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can @-@ Sen@@ ator . &quot;
you made this show .
do anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average person -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of that curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lan@@ s at 7.5 -- therefore something about average , but not exactly what was written on Roy and his team .
about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through Data Analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses dates for it but he does something different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team informed about the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews they give to shows , their course , which shows them , etc .
then they use these data to find out these small details about the viewer : what shows them may , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com with four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a transm@@ itter .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit with this , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this corner . so exactly where they wanted .
of course , the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very knowled@@ geable , data diversi@@ fied companies .
they link this many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
where is that ?
because the logic somehow means that it should work with all .
if one colle@@ cts millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics than back @-@ up .
one can be optimized by very powerful computers .
the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good TV , or ?
when data analysis does not work , then this is a thing fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time in which we are more and more to statistics to take serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know here the company multi @-@ health system ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is here in prison and ask for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , will be decided if a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that is not that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes .
2009 , Google announced that it was obtained by data analytics qu@@ arri@@ es of flu , the worse type , predic@@ tions -- because of data analysis of Google research .
it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success po@@ ached in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked f@@ law@@ less , year by year , until it was no longer working ,
and no one could say why .
it was simply not working , this once again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data sav@@ our companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all of these errors , data flows in decisions of life - in the workplace , in the right @-@ hand installation , in medicine .
so we should prefer to ensure that data is helpful .
even I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics - an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able so many data to make serious decisions , such as decision for a cancer therapy .
or the development of a medication . over the years I realised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
must you ever solve a complex problem , do mainly two things :
as Er@@ stes rip this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a broad set you put the items back together to put a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not intended to compos@@ e the parts again and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool and we possess all : our brain .
when there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces again compos@@ e , even if the information is incomplete , in order to take a good hau@@ l -- especially when the brain is a expert .
therefore , I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and mind , where they also go in process .
they use data to better understand their audience for what else would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts again , and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which does not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they have used data to control all their choices , first when they had vi@@ ed for TV ideas , then elected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong , when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ap or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- precisely here at this moment .
I will begin with a technological demo later .
so far , I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should hear in retro@@ spect on the ball .
however , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a much more washed , such as data analytics , to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very heart@@ ening message that despite the great amount of data still fails to make decisions , an expert in what one does , and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
