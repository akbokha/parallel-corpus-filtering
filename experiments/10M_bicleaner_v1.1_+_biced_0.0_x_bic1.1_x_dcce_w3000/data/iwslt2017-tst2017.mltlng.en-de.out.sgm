<seg id="1">It is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize at the Pulitzer Prize.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA illegally chosen by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's another chapter that should make a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, where the CIA had literally evacuated up for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that mad sounds, you can read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, whom the chapter did not fall?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been chosen against Risen and urged him to name its alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the patterns of the government, whistleblowers to judge and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they are not able to protect the identity of the Muy that they do.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government headed off, he did something that many brave Reporter did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen has lived with the risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, though they have been campaigning for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and springs can always hide more and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of issuing and ending Risen to the statements, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, his telephone calls are secretly worried,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel-wise, with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-whistleblowers and risk factor.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama spoke in his attack, whistle-blowers to protect. but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments to face before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem particularly because the government has too much of its work than secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of whistle-blowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work in the game that is being protected by the first constitutional project because the government has more and more possibilities to spur all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology has allowed the government to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can take this from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which had not existed, as Risen has written its book and it is much safer than regular e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source of treatment system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet famous, which was developed by us called Aaron Swartz, and is today approved by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I work, developed further.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news page, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload documents or send information such as every usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server which only has the particular news.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government may no longer describe secretly, and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments from all over the world develop new spying technologies that threaten us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is in us to make sure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to surrender misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about Misss in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental processors, the alarm for contaminated water of Flint. or a pilgrimage-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover their crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leak of the story published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed "[what is that?] [we bade Robert Palmer of Global Witness].] [what does that mean?] [we bade Robert Palmer from Global Witness to a statement.] this week we were made of messages about a check of 11 million documents in Panama's soliced dressing (s) Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mospack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymes company. can you register it?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We see actually the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This already resulted in a very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also, there have been reports that a allies of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad briefing companies in tax havens has.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of child collages, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others that are nervous about the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agency se or a John-Grisham-Romans.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their property in tax havens, and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, this disclosure is phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, how secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and conceal their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seems very confusing this whole world and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a sailor-manger scene.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company what makes it nearly impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for criminal enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there has been no prominent Americans, who came in this disclosure, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle according to which these tax havens operate, has Mospack Fonseca less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data lease from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would look much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is that you need more information in some US countries, need to provide less information to set up a company than to get a librarian.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of inconsistency in the US has allowed employees to salute workers from debt to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed to be contracted, particularly anrandom investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how it looks like this in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent an embankering revenue to the offices of 13 arrivaling companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself as a African Minister, who wanted to bring evocative money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked it that all the proposals made for a lawyer made our investigator suggestions as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all pre-ministries. none of these lawyers took us to clients as clients, and of course they got not handed over money to someone else. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, who has subjected to our covert proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single leading issue, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to aggravate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very tribulation, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could ever be changed, as if it will always be the rich and powerful ones.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as salvaged optimum, I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen commitments to more transparency which concerns the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU captured in central registers at the national level, who really lies behind firms in Europe and who controlled it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not explain the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means of use to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlights.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in business who stand up and say:" "" "inconsistency is not good for business" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and commit themselves to ending this kind of intransparent laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparent, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering, finally finish.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost drained once and in the trunk of a red Mazzer.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design study, I made a Hinterhöfe.</seg>
<seg id="98">One type in the red Mazda left and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip around the country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you slip until today night?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I do not know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What is I now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Now I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him yet! he says he would go for peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to land in the trunk of an Dress.</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage space!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have a limatratze. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">A voice in my head said, "Eh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was then in bed, I starred at the blanket and thought: "Oh man! what I dropped me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild sea sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I climbed up from the bed, on the tippoint to the door, and shut my sleep-door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, is based in his classroom. he is now teachers.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as a stranger, actually friends, who were just waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">People on my air mattresses to sleep, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates moved out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design Conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it to be afraid of fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I talked about how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay at a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and founded so" "" "air-bed and breakfast" "" "[AIRBed and Breakfast" "" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we saw our last guest and the door into the castle fell, gazing Brian and I felt.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept for it.</seg>
<seg id="138">We presented our Investors: "we want to create a website where people will post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors can be closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite the foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would stop.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not, but.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who still is at comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, one stands on the things that you can well. we could desigate.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and Haptik -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to designate objects but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a fun test, which degree trust we asped.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your coming-time.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlock phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly approach to panic which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts are feeling when they open the first time the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS messages, you see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocking phone of a foreigner in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So feel most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time is who has actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce to Twitter that he serves as president of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would have been revealed once again with his name; if he told he whence he comes, how his dog or his children would be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that are all said: "he can truly be very good unwired handheld!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you then feel when you'd like to submit your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the confidence vital.</seg>
<seg id="173">At first we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for folks to give negative evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally we decided to wait for both the host and the guest who handed over their judgments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how most likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are related to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Very surprising, we trust the people most, which are most like us most.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social function.</seg>
<seg id="181">"" "" "" "it is exciting when you added to the call of a person -- in our case by assessments." ""</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three departments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stipulous similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deeply rooted likes.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we experienced that confidence is dependent on how much you are reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, such as "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell me a lot, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Tolle artwork in your apartment! I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not reckoned with was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismiss these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless efforts of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that previously did not been covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unauthorised partys or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I have worked on customer service in the customer service. all calls joined to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it hurts, if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the Anrufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us further.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million overnight stays there had only one fraction per a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">"" "" "" "for people trusted each other rightly." ""</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust is working, it can be marvelous.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host went him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers who pruning due to their own activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive to hospital by car, if you die, and wait while you get a pass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">And of course not every time goes off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I wondered:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But it is now simply to call "lease" but the cause is not justice.</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "Share Economy describes a trade which promises human relationships." ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People set a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today, it is fast comparing with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place that would be visited, a group there would wait to complete a group there and show a bar in a bar pentine area where you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when you could learn cooking from a five stars cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from the ground up with each other?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would share the thought of shared each day?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and shame.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces that were included in the government.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered by residents. students who were looking for a lead,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were sent to people whose children were moved. there were Incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. our platform alone will be a guest of 785 000 people in 191 countries to be guest in a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be as crazy as it was told us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invented the wheel completely.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there even earlier.</seg>
<seg id="246">There has been similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we know that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to reflect every time when a red Mazda goes past.</seg>
<seg id="253">We of course know that design can not solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we will be able to use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think, if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A creditors? a Expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, undering a brain-undering, a terrorist attack?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media it represents that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study surrendered that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Most likely people do not speak to their users.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual, Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not so born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to ousted me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I chose to wear the Hijab, my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified, "why oppressed you yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The prestige was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, and although compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to settle a perfect and unreachable beauty.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the basket.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought upon, presented in question, doubted and believed ultimately.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and long dedication, deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm always brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I do know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that somebody you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>

<seg id="289">"" "I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian American dream." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that horrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I just sat in my kitchen, had at the end my breakfast, looked up on the screen and saw the word 'Eil'.'</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes floods in buildings, people spranged from buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock changed quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">""... "I changed the television channel and heard:" ""... "Muslim terrorists" ""... "..." ""... "" ""... "" "..." "" "..." ""... "... Jihadist" ""... "" ""... "Zerbombs Mecca!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh, my god.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country had been attacked, but in the Nu, the works of others turned into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the United States in order to move into a new city and start building studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I drove myself -- so deep it went down into my seat, and I feared the first time being recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations having said: "be vigilant," sod careful, "" needy in good iluminated areas, "gatherings you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then, it was Friday during that week -- the day where Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings were saying," "" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be one destination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw this comprehensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably filtered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who held free to Muslims in the Free.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really Brandanations on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this country, our country attacked.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have defeated the anger of people to the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is to be Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslim and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor to be removed as a whole and a benign tumor if one can only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, instructors and Olympionicles.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make the closing of musk America safe?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people to other faith tolerant observable, and greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people will actually not be radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the Radical process, one has found that it is starting online. as Erstes the person can cut off their community, even from their family, so that the person believes that the person believes the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhur their behavior and its ideology is a traitor or from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">When we want to avoid radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a Mother, as a person, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their destiny, if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claiming their ideology to their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you poses a look at it, it does not driving them what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality to let them read these things into scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding beam told me recently a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would have imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radically religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said, the problem was just the opposite. every clergy which had spoken with whom she had spoken, and told her that her anger, her sense of the injustice in the world, she would just bring in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">"" "" "" "nothing inspired by nothing and something that could have happened to her anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists who spoke to a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam set the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse it for their anger, he showed a constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, preserved them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight, as the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy each day, our thought freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show, when we fear, we happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are rather accepting a authorised government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if one defines the people's messages in which negative about Muslims have reported, they voted more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims caught up the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-out of the Iraq war, and out of two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public in order to inflate the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning-sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may sense it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear smote us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectivisence, it is not just about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was in the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, gracious man, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such a sealed young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she assassinated, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He flowed eight times to Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or stayed safely at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We concise it and for us it was no easy decision, for it went out what America we want to leave to our children: one that would be able to control us by fear, or one where we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's headquarters we went away, with high expression on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out and put out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw was holding me.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked him and called our guests welcome, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, faithful and non-believers who have come to join us, but to join us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What are you going to choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number sure?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or are you connecting to those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have taken a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say those who might be claiming that you're holding a TEDTalk, a Memorial with deep draught, thus an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't fool yourself. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I tend to be as it permits.</seg>
<seg id="402">By looking at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever performed study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want to work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people usually appear like an exception, then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What started as a platform for bastion, is about to become a billiary business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Monitoring, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial ones. it is possible to do this in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-pouring into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. a few years ago she started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Thanks to connections, airers reach high speed and acceleration in the stem area.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to bear the burden, to deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our objective is to cross the boundaries of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system autonomous works, it must be collectively knowing where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find items. that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a family of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room, to determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands will be at the highest Eben. e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear-starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A grounding that tries to strike two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrflügler, it is efficient in the heat-flight efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starvation it can float, and thus, it has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hits is that they react hardy to turbulence such as wind farms.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which location the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often ask basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that confrun it to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots-controlled aircraft have been able to fly-controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a rear bow.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong discovered, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanical simplest remote machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No caps, hinges and cross-rups, no further actuators or rollers, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, happens in the interior very much, so that it can be stably able to move and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless it does not have the elegant algorithm of the slope. to get it to fly there, I have to lay it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood to throw it just when all look, is low, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in mogful, this machine is here, the omnip-head with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus, he receives the proper ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is filmed or even as he rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive streams of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly with flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller air equipment.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If one builds them, they behave like a high-performance squares.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, we goes wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic cases.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of culous, co-ordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took the usual Micro-Quadcopter -- every single side weighs less than a slice of bread -- and let them know with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly secure machine since dron wants to be on Broadway a flying lamp bullets.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the pay is in the development and the creation of the work.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magic our universe is, and that it enables creative, clogging sives to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive intellectual and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">Before 1.3 billion years ago, in a very far distant galaxies, two black holes are getting faster, they are turning so the mass of three-rigs in a tenths of pure energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">These short moment they luminous they brighter than all the stars along with all the galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But its energy do not put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time broadcasts himself and the universe was exploded in Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events initially timestly.</seg>
<seg id="476">Just 1.3 billion years ago it was just based on the life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has caused quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, Saurian, people and -- God stand for us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group decided to build a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech - a huge laser detector to seek the gravitational waves, which are by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they stopped for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized it as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades-long development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector LIGO: the laser interferometar gravitational observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the following period the precision of LIGO could substantially increase the recognition of recognition greatly improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, we now call it Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO started up for a final test run by some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two collide black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todill Father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All these, for what I had worked, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on the MIT. he has been studying Gravitational whales from black holes and their observatories like LIGO measurable signals. what are Gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a herb in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">During the shaft of the shaft, the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, faculty are often leading to the theory of relativity often a truly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "extend and dusting, stretching and dust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that Gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and disturbed by us during the waves of the waves. the Dehnung of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is called 20 Nullen after the comma, followed by a 1. Darby, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is absurd, those length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of a nuclear nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on engraving</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOOD, the hunt for the waves in the following: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are abundant.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are dark and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott holds gladly, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: face extracts, the size of your phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by doing that from multiple points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">At notes is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that will mean a lot for you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as sound and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is about Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to Gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple photos of objects in the universe with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least, for LIGO the measured frequencies are measured in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wavepattern in shall, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of listening, can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, what my colleague Scott has very long been employed.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotting holes, circulating just: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same plight with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement-key, shaped in the wave form.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - heard LIGO: [Surrendes sound] Jemand, who knows what to hear it, it recognises this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-fold sun mass, which will turn around as fast as the rods of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichting body in space, one with a mass of 29 Sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 probes, revolve each hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it, because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"" "" "" "LIGO leaves a completely new way to explore the universe as they have never been possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to all the louder and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practical or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A Supernova, for example. I would like to know why masculine stars in Supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about them about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen but at the core, which lies behind thousands kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never get through, because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if there would be more transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see her, since the Big Bang is distorted by his own light-lights.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves, it should be possible to return until the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of whom we didn't have any idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO found equal in the first sight of things which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at the MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this subject: Me: the kind of stars, black holes, how LIGO her observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies from prehistoric times. black holes are so-called for our archaeological work.</seg>

<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "a year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "in front of which I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Regardless of whether it made me nervous, bringing me into unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">I wanted to speak in the public domain?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">I wanted to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, though I feared, my fear was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, to keep speeches, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, that deeply changed my life to an unexpected Art. it all started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-free."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life setting in my family. from there I sweeping me to always play with them as soon as you ask myself, no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I effortless myself very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astounding side-effect: only recently, I was actually complete, that the 'yes' slogan to play with my children my career saved.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am Autorin. I think of things, awakes you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream-job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream-job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I productive television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for allowing for 70 hours to go out into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program provides hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The book for an episode of a TV channel may lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode alle nine days times four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three episodes, die simultaneously in production, mal four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series is going on on Thursday nights.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world I run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts made by myself, and not only produces, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans to camp and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world burn.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream-job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls. "</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you, so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now taking a company, a land or a classroom, so that I am talking about my job, so that you don't just get around on the computer rob and fantasiere, and it is right when I say, I understand that it does not work with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deeply deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is, when I put forces on, as my old I was on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a stroke you have a high tone, liefe a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational, and the best thing is the sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume when I declare them the sums that I am talking about writing, that writing my joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work with television production when I began to work and to work and to work, build and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. sums up!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, you do not want to be different from the size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not different to be different from size to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of things.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I did not fail for the failure, and I just know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more hiberle boundaries, the more work there are the more things simultaneously, the more I'm watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations they are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, passed, exaggerated, extended.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mama is a single working titanium.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mommy will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a song.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-bananas.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The amount of the engine is petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans-work, 15 hours days, practised weekends, no Reue, nothing delegate, a Titan slack does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Preshow-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and sums was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the job you love, suddenly turn?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "hash you out, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you are working to be a teacher like a banker who knows the sums, one who knows the sums, and knows how the sums doesn't know when the sums stops, if the sums stops, who is man then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress after me is a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, too late and she says," "" "Mama, lean you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no more than two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not name no more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it, when I am Titan bin and my sums betweere, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, lean you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "everbody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding as my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the lack of summing, I can do nothing except to stop.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country, which I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists-fiery fingers and humid nuts, delicate voices, waxle, and the song that let it go to slogans, or whatever the girl bark into "The ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere, peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me resolve itself.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy supply comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sums.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. it is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working environment, the titanium letins, which is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I'm in using broadcasts and TV hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The true sums is dependent on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums is the stream which comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True sums ignored the pressure of history, which is to enlighten tasks, the expectation and the print.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">True sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I am escaping God the wrong words: for which God told me that I am a Titan Poker?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so I can free myself as a workaholic of any kind.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice, unless I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not aned to me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I am always working, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace as an daho.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of man work better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "let me honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We go around in the garden, before and back, and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and playing ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We brake Seifenblasen.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly, absent, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ask for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play, till I ask myself: why have we ever stopped using the game?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always tell me if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naïve, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You will be right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My children want to play at most 15 minutes, up to them for them to make something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes there was a puppy or biscuit.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teen-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more will not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Anyone can get 15 minutes a bit, even to a bad-whune day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to do.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "Play" in general.</seg>

<seg id="761">Find out what is good to you.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums come back in my free time. the sums then seems to return if I am not working.</seg>

<seg id="769">It takes time but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fulfills me and my soul. she tempts me to discover new ideas. I am tempted to his path again. I take advantage of it to full and love my work again.</seg>

<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means his dream to live.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said yes' to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke, or after an accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very small ability to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was working for Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Surely they have heard from one of the most prominent, the "low-irrigation stimulation. it implanted a electrode deeply in the brain in order to influence the schematic of the neurons so that the neurological feature improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe pain and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a leader and worked in the emergency day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often, I accomodate patients with skull-deer-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at skull-brain-traumas, the brain goes off and the skull pressure are increasing.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save lives, you have to decrease the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Actually you sometimes have to remove a part of braked brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the braking brain, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, an biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue cell, comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw him under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you are still aware of the speciology essons that stem cells unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small neath of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they get very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells uncovered different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slow and after a few weeks they died even.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">These cells come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot potato cortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You get 4% of our big hirundancy cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe they are taking part in healing of the brain since we find them close to brain injury.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is however clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"" "" "" "we are facing a potential cell source, the brains of the brain." ""</seg>
<seg id="850">This had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic field and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark in the brain to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimplanted them at the Displacement of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autonomous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimpose the same cells in a braised brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">With the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain and we watched that they disappeared after several weeks as if they were taken again, they go back home. the space is already busy, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we add an injury to and reimplantied exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they washed away to mature neneurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch below the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we stripped in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkeys to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual workbook task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did so very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they had achieved a stable level of skill, we recorded in the motoric Cortex in the handcling area.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move her hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they didn't recover spontaneously, to some extent, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to relax with the help of plastic brain mechanism. they relax at some degree, just as in the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left they see the monkey, which grew spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can take about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not that precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the Reimplantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that we were very exciting for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can make them freeze and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other new ropathological models, for example with Parkinson.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them on humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne which is wonderful, I'm sure that even now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who may need that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I in any case.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at human.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Firstly, it depends on the admission of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it take us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then one must perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose patients to perform and evaluate treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to use this on a multicentralized study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them naturally.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as our inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an unchanging feeling.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism leads to democracy inevitably.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big afternoons in Beijing have shown beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely non-democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy dwindles with us in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">Earlier this year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - do not affect austerity policies which were produced in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my dissued friends who would say that democracy would be abolished when something would change.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yv, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save ourselves, but that we need a true and defective democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "for without democracy our societies become fit, our future dushed and our great, new technologies are wasted." ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatening our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twins" "" "Paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">One summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Shouldenberg, who casts its long shadow over the U.S., Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the school-mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its constraints.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is, however, is too anxious to invest there, where it would be productive and income may be brought in by which one could produce the debt-mountain, and also all those things could produce that humanity urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the last 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 billion dollars is invested in all the well-producing goods, such as industrial installations, machines, offices, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 billion dollars of US dollars for much money until you compare it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions are around, and absolutely nothing did except to mower the flank and the property prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and non-productive capital form the twin summit, which cannot be eliminated from the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe. therefore, a low demand powering the pessimism of investors, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the Orakel could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,</seg>
<seg id="925">Uncertain the circumstances cause this cause that oedipus kill him fatal.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haunts with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its exceedingly sophisticated capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to provide particularly all the technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe already. but before we continue, what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the corporate form, in which the open air and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy of course closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">It would however be a mistake to minate the significance of the athic democracy due to these ticollars.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decision of the atharian democracy was and is that she has entered the working poor and not only has the right to freedom of speech, but rather important and decisive that she has the right to approving political decision with the same voicing in matters of government officials.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long kept --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that is very bright it is also rapidly spread out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy, on the free citizen, concentrated and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for the ruling class.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was singled to politics, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone was made.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the timing of which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two are taking place by the economy and deprives them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are not as much as previously?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it is possible to be in government today and yet not in power, because the power of politics is wanders into the economy and separated the areas.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haunts with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is something like a flock of prey, who so sustainably the animals, of which they are underfed, decimed that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "similarly, it is with the economy that increases policy so far. the power of corporations increases, economic goods will grow, the economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are frightened to invest the cash flow of their business." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">The successful of capitalism the "Demos" is pushing out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the policy and the economy back together, and it would be better if the "Demos" retain control of such as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it didn't arise very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The theory of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can regain a stand like in the ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor can create!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by placing Niedriglohnologize by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as business and politics are separate areas, automation boosts the twin summit, the wasting waste, and the social conflicts lower, as it -- already very soon as I think it will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We need to restructure the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and thereby consider the re-united area, otherwise we end in a disease-responsible hyperautocracy that can appear to the movie "Matrix" such as documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not that capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is dissolved by a Dystrophy, similar to "matrix", in which machines serve man and to put people their energy into research into the universe, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks to the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what does it look, how could it look like these "star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopy?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you, in a brief outline, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: ask yourself a capital market in which you earn money while you work and where your capital goes from a job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, the revenues come from capital and the redeeming, and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who belong to the companies, which are not working in them, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and expenses, and ultimately no contemporaneous twins summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies had a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, created from the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], which is presented in the interest of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum which matches the trade deficit or trading transfer of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment means.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to realise it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, particularly before the background of a reunited politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time a Liberary, in which they preferred individuals, and Marxist, because they are buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can introduce real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar Dystrophy?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we have to decide.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography yourself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do we do not, the technological development is causing so massive decline in the whole economic demand that Larry Summers are called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">"" "" "" "by transferring this crisis from one part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low." ""</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely wiring.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are at ease too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not mistaken, one does not think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein, which said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China, and yesterday at the speakers of the speakers, you said very clearly what you hold from the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have a semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of the economy is bothered, -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratically-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain way, if I can say that provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical as concerns the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe now in China, resembles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now propose to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells by hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many people might be curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that that comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you take a look back at the first half of six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, we say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the constant denial that ran down a massive overthrowing line by the eurozone and continues to be emphasized the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is right to do. unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, inside the European-group, continues to deny the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union.</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, he happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what kind of change see you in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future when we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any Minister, who has been in office after 6 months, particularly in such a tense situation, he has no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Obviously, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for an extension of the school programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"" "" "" "I believed that there was an honest interest on the site of the donors to find a common solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government to case simply because they didn't want to deal with the failures supported by the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they have carried out a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's trodonors who raised us to this policy was a" "" "it was a kolossant error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolute.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming to someone who lives and loves." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"" "" "" "for when they are not surviving, the frechant murders will be demonic and destroy the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have disastrous consequences alone for Europe but for the whole world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to strike the path of a postmodern 1930, for which it appears to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">By Roy, most have never heard before, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate moments of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for too many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">It goes back to decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production facility from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very serious industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right on this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating division of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received this evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1050">When your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "" The Wire "" "" The Wire "" "" The Wire "" "," The Wire "" "," The Wire "" "," where, after you saw a season, your brain asks: "" "" where are more of these episodes? "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows are like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at the end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not focus on the left side of the turn, because I think you need special intelligence to provide "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">It turns out more thoughts on the middle excrement, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy price is going to risk.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he is holding a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon there are any stuff out there, one can do something right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers will take a look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they don't know they are watching when watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are observed by Roy and his team who will record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you are pauses, which parts you skips or once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact they collect the data, process these and it is the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom via four Republican-Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average person -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of that curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lans at 7.5 -- therefore something about average, but not exactly what was written on Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through Data Analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always searching for this a super show and he also uses dates for it but he does something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team informed about the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give to shows, their course, which shows them, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these small details about the viewer: what shows them may, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom with four senators but a drama series about a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has a hit with this, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this corner. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very knowledgeable, data diversified companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They link this many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">Where is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow means that it should work with all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics than back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One can be optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis does not work, then this is a thing frightening because we live in a time in which we are more and more to statistics to take serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company multi-health system?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is here in prison and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, will be decided if a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that is not that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that it was obtained by data analytics quarries of flu, the worse type, predictions -- because of data analysis of Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success poached in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawless, year by year, until it was no longer working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It was simply not working, this once again was a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data savour companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all of these errors, data flows in decisions of life - in the workplace, in the right-hand installation, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should prefer to ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Even I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very smart people unimaginable so many data to make serious decisions, such as decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I realised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">Must you ever solve a complex problem, do mainly two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As Erstes rip this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a broad set you put the items back together to put a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not intended to compose the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we possess all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">When there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces again compose, even if the information is incomplete, in order to take a good haul -- especially when the brain is a expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think I was Netflix so successful because they have used data and mind, where they also go in process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience for what else would not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts again, and make a show like "House of Cards" which does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They have used data to control all their choices, first when they had vied for TV ideas, then elected "Alpha House" as show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the dates." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"" "" "" "data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong, when data start to control our decisions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaap or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- precisely here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will begin with a technological demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should hear in retrospect on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a much more washed, such as data analytics, to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something exceptional at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very heartening message that despite the great amount of data still fails to make decisions, an expert in what one does, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
