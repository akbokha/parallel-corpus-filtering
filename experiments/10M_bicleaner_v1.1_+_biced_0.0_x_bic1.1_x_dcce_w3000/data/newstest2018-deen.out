Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view on the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people are to face today .
a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel is buried .
small @-@ gar@@ dener gives the most common cause of peasants .
the oldest official card of Munich fo@@ sters exciting stories to days .
it is annoying if maps are not up to date .
this knows everyone who had to take a thr@@ illing time , because the auto @-@ Nav@@ i instead had a green meadow instead of a envel@@ ope .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als in the state government , are anything but current - yet very short @-@ breaking .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Flick@@ r ep@@ p@@ ich , which one cannot realize as such .
in the vast surplus @-@ postcard for cities and villages were detailed , so @-@ called Ur@@ position @-@ sheets , incorporated .
these emerged according to data from the Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and origin@@ ate from the first survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leaders took part in Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War , with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country , and gave a to@@ po@@ graphical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops reached the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neigh@@ bor that created the idea of a region @-@ covered Bayern @-@ Card .
Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; to@@ po@@ graphical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ ball@@ ungs@@ verwaltung .
the certificate for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like to find all the other on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ isches Land .
the comparison of fruits / Gestern , the provincial capital , is the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ set , that appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
Send@@ ling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as Mün@@ chner district .
today , sub@@ mer@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses sub@@ types focus on 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after 1878 Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the insur@@ rection of Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the west @-@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when Hin@@ du@@ o@@ omen appears a small @-@ piece map with do@@ zens lines and numbers : hand@@ written number@@ ed Fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ s &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small pitches are evidence there today neither farmers left - but small gar@@ dener of the complex &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green space is drawn north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ room of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychi@@ atric medicine .
in the jungle leaf@@ let one reads in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig . or from the hei@@ g@@ th &quot; On the ventilation &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren institutions . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse one wi@@ ped once people with del@@ usions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard ruled by G@@ ud@@ den , the establishment - that psychiat@@ r@@ ist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs II .
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ank@@ le of the so @-@ called Irish .
he is also allowed to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ m@@ ates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients first place was first place , later was extended to 500 places .
sometime , this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Am@@ per @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , is one of the biggest psychiat@@ r@@ rien in Germany .
on the field of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , now young people meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Or@@ ders er@@ war@@ y the building complex 1920 and walked it into a youth @-@ home with educational institutions .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 we set up the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architectural structure at the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance house , which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was marked by 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the merch@@ ant street was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decisive change led the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies on December 1944 are a lot of holes in the city center .
a big family stayed today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a greeting @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof where these days are working and take place on 5 April 2017 in the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich for the second S @-@ Bahn .
with the slide bar the old Munich map is compared with the a@@ erial photograph of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ us .
civil rights released travel agency for Miss@@ our@@ i
the national association for the promotion of colored people has issued a warning for more colored people who travel to Miss@@ our@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policy and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel advisory for the federal state of Miss@@ our@@ i , which until 28 August 2017 , calls for A@@ fr@@ o American travellers , visitors and Miss@@ ou@@ ri@@ ans to take special attention by the state , as a series of frag@@ ile , ra@@ ils @-@ based inci@@ dents in the last time occur in the entire state and can be noted , &quot; stated in the statement of the group .
a recently adopted law by Miss@@ our@@ i , which makes it a man harder to gain discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ ution of the State , which dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to release the journey , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have injury to citizens &apos; rights , which will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are raised because of their skin colour , they are put together or killed , &quot; said the President of Miss@@ our@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints with such a frequency that we have not heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
the Group cited as r@@ assi@@ stic breach of black students at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under frag@@ ile conditions at the beginning of the year , after having lost no pet@@ rol in cust@@ ody during the journey through the state , and carried out by the police of Miss@@ our@@ i in cust@@ ody without a crime to be accused .
the Council also pointed to a recent report by the office of the general state of Miss@@ our@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are risen by 75 percent more frequently than budget@@ ing .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Miss@@ our@@ i , &quot; said chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready if there is Cau@@ row , or to know the relatives , that they are travelling by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miss@@ our@@ i recorded 100 Hass@@ en@@ y in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ en@@ bre@@ d &apos; reporting program , which reached the state regarding the number of such violations by the 16th place in the country .
the travel agency is also an answer to a new Miss@@ our@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil liberties Union ( AC@@ LU ) travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , published after the immigration law enforcement authorities , to conce@@ al local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to what the AC@@ PI contributes to a further element of seg@@ reg@@ ation .
travel documents are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but in recent times interested parties have the measure of response to certain laws and trends within the USA .
Wei@@ dec@@ ep@@ projekt is elementary
the fisher@@ man &apos;s spru@@ ce project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Bundest@@ ags Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have acquired an image about the site .
at the legitimacy of the family Schwen@@ n@@ mann met representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U local community together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann offers first insights into its operation where he cultivated 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows , and as many young animals , and in five apartments accommodate houses .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ mil@@ ch &quot; is for him the alternative disposal for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ n@@ mann .
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ ste comes only regional .
since he is also the Chairman of the fisher@@ man , he referred to the Wei@@ dec@@ aun@@ project as &quot; fundamental importance . &quot;
I can not manage such st@@ rolling surfaces in a profitable way .
the green space for a lot of work , much it must be processed with the motor@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and with the to@@ il to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ ous operation and served this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not conduct any bio@@ energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une recognized the importance of the Wei@@ dec@@ ay project and is pleased with the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported by farmers .
we hope that the re@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation of the surfaces might be gone out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and make sense of how they can continue their operation , &quot; said the Mayor .
the farmers have often been critical in criticism because of their support .
more than 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the unveil@@ ing surface is thus 40 hectares of which up to at least 20@@ 23 cannot be re@@ medi@@ ated .
the total cost of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded half of the Leader , a quarter of the fisher@@ man village .
thus , the farmer needs 12 610 euros , who had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of inc@@ eption .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Til@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did a really good job , without farmers and land@@ owners it will not go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiss was fixed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landmark line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes possible the state promotion of past@@ ures .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
a pre@@ condition is the presence of one of the L@@ PR group@@ ed .
in addition , the prot@@ rac@@ ted area must not be scar@@ ce ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation .
for the fisher@@ man &apos;s spru@@ ce project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 cells , who wish to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .
the unveil@@ ing surface of 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump will take the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans also appreciate this as any other - hence the pain@@ st@@ ine Stur@@ z Saddam H@@ uss@@ ein on the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew surely what he did when he began a symbolic battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to the dra@@ stic restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller went out the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of jet@@ ties and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators could have ha@@ ze him if he had done it .
but he attacked their meaning , and in particular the meaning that it was written , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta was coated , &quot; I do not want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ light@@ ens the world .
the poem which you refer , which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
Miller is properly correct , but as he form@@ ulate it , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the sho@@ ok words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your fort@@ less , your poor , / your crow@@ ned masses , who after that long , free to breathe , / the mis@@ erable waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there never has been a time in which the &quot; fin@@ er waste &quot; was better to see on our scre@@ ens .
Miller comm@@ ited not in liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly stated that these people are not welcome in tr@@ umps .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute . it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends , who put themselves in favor of placing their words on the basis for their death - knew very well that they are doing a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ anism , in a worn @-@ out classical portra@@ yal of the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in its poem the feminine figure is no longer abstr@@ ac@@ tly - it has received a voice .
and she gives yourself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p , and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just like Laz@@ arus changed the importance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to reg@@ ain this for a long time .
the grand scre@@ aming of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a sort of John the B@@ apt@@ ist for the coming from Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 , that the Statue of Liberty , was argu@@ ed that the American flame is said , that the American flame is doing in the re@@ im@@ ned World : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding .
it is said to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something like .
the significance of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they had seen from the exhau@@ stive , stri@@ ving , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journey on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense about seeing the world from the perspective of men who seek refu@@ ge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way but the hate who is their only source of power .
World@@ championship 2017 : Neil Black lo@@ bt Sch@@ ott@@ ish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle is reminded of a time when only two vill@@ i belonged to the team of Great Britain
the director of the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ headed Sch@@ ott@@ ish cont@@ ingent of the World Championships was a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland a special light develops and the Ath@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue doing it until we figure it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sh@@ ot@@ tic ath@@ lets think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish Ath@@ l@@ ete are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which are to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team chapel .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or where always they live or train , they went out of space and felt very proud and were highly motivated .
the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie did quite naturally , were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver med@@ an , who is over the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles to the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 car@@ r@@ ots in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s largest number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the Mu@@ ir S@@ old trail leads on this path and has held five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are who runs up to 1,500 m is another Scot@@ sman , which you should watch for a great season , which included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mann@@ ing capitals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team but also in some cases join the medals and at the Fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special about this team surrender to be that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour , but to know that my team @-@ mate for me have been voted for me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that are part of the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here to be established athletes , athletes who want to go to po@@ di@@ ets .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home World Championship .
so it is really important to place your home suppor@@ ter and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out and compete , and it &apos;s going to be so a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking from critics via Facebook : be@@ ating yourself not about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the un@@ folding of voters
the father of our land knew a bit of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers suggested it for everything from domestic policy up to his political principles .
he sent down in criticism , safe .
but he has not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly , and mu@@ te , we are led to the sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to the govern@@ or of Lar@@ ry Ah@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil War did not for@@ pl@@ ased it this week at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor did the k@@ position as fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; told many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type such as Hog@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can govern@@ or in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second @-@ highest consent of the 50 Gover@@ nor of the Nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has established a firm hand in the guidance of his state and strict adh@@ er@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to re@@ connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ ade of people who come to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum that is referred to as officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ in Amelia Ch@@ asse ins@@ ist the acts of the Govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of TRO@@ LL@@ EN or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ amm@@ ing people that swe@@ ating online the lash .
the post office spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , not a role .
they all said that their comments were respectful , thought@@ ful and not profound .
the pastor &apos;s pastor in his post and appe@@ aled to the Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyers Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ asser@@ ts , but she asked about Hass@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I deser@@ ted polit@@ ely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate speech and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them in the commentary area of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I also appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are ab@@ used by some more likely as a so @-@ called collec@@ tiv@@ ist use and is not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Gover@@ nor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated work &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would possibly be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a cr@@ itic or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical arti@@ st@@ itutes , to burn or burn demonstr@@ ators , and to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but that is exactly what is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah@@ an is not the first public official that is critic@@ ised for it that he implies Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tr@@ ump will l@@ m@@ ess from Twitter @-@ users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the President of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County is the first one of the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the US District Apostle James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she called a voters of her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , govern@@ or Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ LU , because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied in between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous &quot; letter to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had an anonymous t@@ roll .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who use p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms as &quot; Ju@@ ri@@ cola &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Valeri@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers who made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pet@@ itions , which has been critic@@ ised his point of view on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the Trade and the boat trip with the United Kingdom , great position , according to historical documents produced by the online Pap@@ ers by George Washington Project .
but he did not get them sil@@ enced .
freedom of expression , opinion and dis@@ course are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means that to accept .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th issue of Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who conducted the last year at the Ar@@ cher@@ field left until En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament @-@ amb@@ assador in the name of the association , and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he stuck this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British Gu@@ ales is looking forward to uph@@ old a master@@ y for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that really feels particularly &quot; said the player &quot; South@@ port was native .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was last year after I had won them out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to come back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
it was a really special time and one which we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year earlier this year .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you can also feel this extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I have played a solid play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how the way we have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

lower lungs through passive exposure
in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive cancer in lung cancer .
this result is the scientists of the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , per year of the pul@@ mon@@ ology of pul@@ mon@@ y cases are attributed to passive tobacco , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said study manager Heiko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when compared he moved to this topic from 1994 to date .
at that time there were 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cases because of passive cancer per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house sh@@ orts are proven to be very complex
construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie down in the period , &quot; says the manager of the place Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house &apos;s degrees , the situation was more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much ver@@ eb@@ erg@@ s , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which always hin@@ dered the construction work for the construction ru@@ pp of the company St@@ ump@@ p a major problem .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of motor@@ ists from red lights and un@@ lock is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .
the road is locked and only the regular buses were allowed to the passage .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cook the dinner , it uses no co@@ oker .
it even makes it rarely a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ine in the un@@ quiet ind@@ on@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally as &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the conden@@ sed tu@@ bers with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed out hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the loft - she has no furniture - where she also performs their daily work , such as clothes with trendy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a canopy space serves as a lat@@ ex .
as the youngest of the four wives , their hus@@ bands were not assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ ie is here common .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are here the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one says it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was received in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders should be obtained in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement that explo@@ des for independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds its control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or rule of law .
in 2003 the province became divided into Pap@@ ua and the West Pap@@ ua , with an independent part of Pap@@ ua New@@ gu@@ ine@@ as occupied the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
the city with approximately 19,@@ 000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ trees , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated fields that have been converted by R@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown trou@@ ts .
only very few Indon@@ esian have made their journey here , since journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , schol@@ ar Army P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to carry these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points on their lively , handmade t@@ amb@@ ten Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt , and her bright rock .
&quot; earlier we only had sheets of our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is the Indon@@ esian province , where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
the largest and profitable automobile mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high provincial capital in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort awarded a value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper .
furthermore , Pap@@ ua has wooden resources worth valued 78 billion US dollars .
but these ri@@ ches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indon@@ esian em@@ powerment that military is a first @-@ hand presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ al calls after greater autonomy and thre@@ aten these golden gre@@ ets and become un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military .
Mass@@ ac@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ ah Tribal Pro@@ state in the 1970 @-@ 1980 &apos;s became in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission on genocide .
in the region alone the Indon@@ esian police last year more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conclude Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ bane origin@@ ating from the year 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities and torture - rape and rel@@ ent@@ ations are especially popular according to another report - and the brutal exp@@ ul@@ arity of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as every week , Andreas Har@@ son@@ o says Indonesia @-@ researchers for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have reinforced , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is a 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants have come from the most populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning @-@ Kant@@ inen sell br@@ at@@ enes en chicken and gado @-@ gado , a mixed vegetables with stra@@ wberry .
local people are fighting to play here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai native local , who moved to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the mother @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
the Indon@@ esian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , in the crowd and were known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , did not address the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign .
the former car@@ p@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes , that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
actually , Pan@@ i@@ ai actually suffered only two months after the Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indon@@ esian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the ro@@ cked children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took notice of her tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , and swal@@ lowed the group with their gun , they said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fi@@ red into the group of children .
one child , the age of 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to put him into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and the things had escal@@ ated on the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground before the local police station and the military command@@ ing centre to ask justice .
they carried red cap@@ sul@@ ated fighters and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bir@@ ths im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as army P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag stones on police and military out@@ post .
when the mood had been heated , the soldiers were sent to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses perform more than three times resistance , they shoot it dead , &quot; it is in an official document of TIME that has not been released the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego k@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the elevated risk and called for tranquility and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes @-@ wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TIME on the ver@@ anda of his colour@@ ful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
kay@@ ame still does not know who car@@ ts , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the rows of the congreg@@ ated soldiers .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were p@@ ayed , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was made three times , as his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and sear@@ ched his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ esi@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ esi@@ ans just a name , the TIME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I k@@ issed him . &quot;
the editor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Rep@@ or@@ ters , that his officers did their station only &quot; secure &quot; because she would be attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others have been wo@@ unded .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate address , in which he sympath@@ iz@@ able sympath@@ ies in the families of the victims and sw@@ elled the historical abuse of the Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this eventu@@ ality to be solved immediately so that in future it will no longer happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he initiated a foreign mechanism to add historic rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries are before a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ year and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , the Nav@@ ac@@ itor made a retreat when he talked with TIME on June 5 at Jak@@ arta and said he did not have any plans , in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , will be governed by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wir@@ anto , which accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in the Pap@@ ua was already included , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to alleg@@ ations of such claims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear for years later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I are afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear have to discuss the incident .
he says he was be@@ aten up by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military came to me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday took the Indon@@ esian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to put an un@@ conscious man into the hospital , died a person and 17 other were inju@@ red , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was er@@ dr@@ unk , when he fis@@ her in a nearby river fis@@ her , died on the way to hospital .
depos@@ ited vill@@ agers protest@@ ed in front of the s@@ iting office of the company .
the police said that the vill@@ agers were on officers who were re@@ acted by having war@@ nuts .
but locals say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and a deadly .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will be reven@@ ge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witn@@ essed how the ship@@ pers were delivered quickly , so the TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am two days hidden in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai @-@ Parliament has called on to account the officials involved and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been a dor@@ man@@ ner@@ ed for the Indon@@ esian government .
the lack of its ev@@ ous development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal army , mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al which live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , who claimed to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by using spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indon@@ esian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ top guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to the last few years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ ary under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure the national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will never dive again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forget@@ table place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ content .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and pun@@ ish .
farming is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of Sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of emer@@ gen@@ cies cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian Ru@@ pi@@ as ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger number have arrived .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua have rarely got the capital or the necessary skills to compete for their own companies competitive .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on international media are ex@@ ited .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp was de@@ ported due to poor co @-@ ordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission for the film was given .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , the restrictions of reporting to up@@ lift transparency and development is not realised .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report of Indon@@ esian peac@@ efully ast@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and V@@ pap@@ ua : visa obj@@ ection and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbors Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pa@@ zi@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Inseln at the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dism@@ issed the pre@@ aches of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta . &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to a source that took part in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesia certainly has another presidential election but the Pap@@ ua say they will likely not be hi@@ red for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai associations , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Chief Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a peasant military , lives in arm@@ our educ@@ ating and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , see their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; blame &quot; that he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; you do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ sacrifice led a last symbolic act of the d@@ ope : the cor@@ pse of a sl@@ um was buried on a terrain precisely in front of the police and the military station .
they know their might never come for justice , but at least they do not forget the persons responsible for crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with soci@@ alized head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential doors in Dubai in Dubai to fle@@ e his play@@ back and w@@ ang hundreds of inhabitants from which 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building to fle@@ e .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years through the Hoch@@ haus which is f@@ eit@@ ed the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries have not been reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we were up with fire alarm and scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident , who writes its name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais Local authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ pm GMT ) the fire ext@@ ingu@@ ished and the building cooler .
the Government said , they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can be used issues relating to safety of materials , which are used in areas of areas of skyscr@@ apers throughout the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from fair@@ ing , Ou@@ ter@@ wear for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said , they believe that the system of plates to isolation and Bonn@@ et in the London Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower in June to have contributed to the rapid spread of a branch of industry , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through with its great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h city was the only supported for this sport @-@ revolutionary suggestion , Davis Cup sol@@ itary confin@@ ed only to play two winn@@ ings , Hau@@ ling does not support the required two @-@ third majority .
the although very long , but also very pointed five @-@ sentence classics stay with the tradition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our membership will not have the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to ensure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the applic@@ ants .
certainly not only in the vote was the proposal before before the proposal came to a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists of the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be in the first round the host &apos;s right next year .
in order to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements in terms of training courses etc are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to complete the Davis Cup less official media appointments .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers can manage items into plane , find a survey
a survey among passengers take out that more than 20 percent deliber@@ ately un@@ aware or un@@ consciously placed items in the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration is over , including at least 6 percent , who betra@@ y the plane , while they acci@@ dentally found knife , or other objects with blade .
less than 1 per cent donated , they have been bel@@ ated that they have been irrit@@ ated with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - provided by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ atos Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also confirmed that younger travellers would rather de@@ consider the rules .
from the respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 per cent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common objects that were deliber@@ ately presented to T@@ SA agents , were foods and liqui@@ ds .
more than 3 percent added to , kno@@ w@@ ingly items with blade by using the security checks , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.8 per cent of male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliber@@ ately brought embarrass@@ ed drugs into the plane .
the company said it was question@@ ed travellers around the country to find out how many different sm@@ ug@@ gling hot@@ ware would have brought down through the airport security and how many things were done clearly .
it is no surprise that people who were most sm@@ ug@@ ging most sm@@ ug@@ gling , kno@@ w@@ ingly or in@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly -- by security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company pointed out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a little complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often un@@ certain which liqui@@ ds can take them or how much of it .
so there is no surprise that the largest amount of liqui@@ ds in the T@@ SA can be pl@@ eted items .
a while , the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers .
liqui@@ ds are available on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ subscri@@ bing
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , he has hi@@ ther@@ to under@@ cut that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
besides the always tri@@ umph@@ ant numbers of sales growth and another gigantic power targets , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time to betra@@ y the latest quar@@ terly assessment for the first time , the cancellation of the new Mass market model 3 .
in the past few months Mus@@ k has often applied with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts .
now Mus@@ k , one : of the total 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre@@ orders have been re@@ trac@@ ted 6@@ 3,000 already again .
critics always had pointed out that it was only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in a cancellation Tes@@ la the 1000 euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; returned .
presently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , sp@@ ered Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
that cancellation of so far has been around 12 percent of all orders to be solved , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe .
its objective : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
over the last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles supplied .
2018 we are supposed to be together - all models put together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is evident .
according to Mus@@ k , some 2,000 reservations are currently being made .
those who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be ordered at the earliest , at the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never into practice with maximum inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum exposure .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but it comes to larger delays , then the im@@ binding reservations could be the problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent non @-@ satisfied customers from swe@@ ating in dro@@ ves .

&quot; &quot; &quot; pru@@ dent announced in June that he will be able to comply with his authority to give his authority more time to study the plan and to hin@@ der themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in local decisions or to hin@@ der the economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pru@@ dent , who in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Cou@@ l@@ ament@@ ary of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time , a reliable opponent inst@@ ated against environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , Pru@@ dential has repeatedly passed on blocking or delay the fossil fuels to the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal return for the Pru@@ dential Roll@@ back agenda .
the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in Washington decided that the EPA has passed his authority as he tried to implement the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks .
in one on Wednesday evening , pru@@ dent proposed that his rel@@ ational work with O@@ zone standards quite simply the willingness of EPA to engage in cooperation with the states by the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administrative divisions , the EPA has often not respected the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then servic@@ ed by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement reached an appointment for performing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Pru@@ dential , who did more than a dozen time in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority that there are us , serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EU &apos;s opinion said that Pru@@ dential will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all the other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to ensure that the provisions will be based on solid politics and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress is pushing for a broader setting of oz@@ on@@ ation .
one in the last month approved bill is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made in the Senate .
the New York @-@ general secret@@ ary Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who had w@@ ailed the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain the statutory pres@@ sures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our charges - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the sm@@ og who flows into their communities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York is closed in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Min@@ nes@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
floor @-@ Oz@@ on arises , when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refined , chemical plants , and other sources in the atmosphere of sunlight react .
the resulting sm@@ og can cause serious difficulty of people serious respir@@ problems , and each year contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health sector and the environ@@ ment@@ alists are rejo@@ iced about Pru@@ sia surprising change .
&quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we received , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue fighting the ide@@ ological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump Government to engage in environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ski celeb@@ rates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church

the wording of the certificate after stood on the tum@@ ble hill beyond the one @-@ time parish church , also a fabulous courtyard , to which the church or the patron saint belonged to the other and not the other way round .
so there are also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ ante Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was besides the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ bled to be seen still , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third one , of glorious sett@@ lers of the village .

the patron of pat@@ ron@@ ement was born of the earliest medieval egg law .
a Lord , who built a church , taken up , and occupied with a pastor , he remained faithful to this church and could well toler@@ ate this pecu@@ liar church .
related it was the right to use a pastor or to propos@@ ing a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ ers of the two zer@@ w@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell set then in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window was@@ hers were introduced and the bells were stolen .
the roof was imper@@ me@@ able .

only the church tower was allowed to stand .
in the New Year in 18@@ 34 , a storm the church tower and half rus@@ hed .
to prevent an un@@ happiness , the tower was interrupted .

the Association wants to check permission of bicycles
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not consider any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned towards the Land of Land@@ rat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim w@@ akes &quot; has requested Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval by 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at that time in Vier@@ sen only exists on the border line to swal@@ lows a wind force of wind concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentration of concentration camps but a exclusion of wind turbines for the remaining urban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier by amending the landing development plan a second wind@@ mill zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but who had not approved the district government Düsseldorf because of a form@@ id@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the lack of plan@@ ation legal requirement , the shared permits remains un@@ law@@ ful and therefore back to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Erk@@ ing , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council postpon@@ ed the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a approval of the District government is still out .
cold : &quot; thus , at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines are excluded . &quot;
the circle confirmed the receipt of the so@@ lic@@ itation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing have been given by the circle Vier@@ sen since past week , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with view on the ongoing process at the Court of Directors , the circle of Thursday did not want to express themselves in terms of reason@@ ing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW re , an subsidiary of NEW , is planning a surface at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind .
already last year , the company engaged in which the city of Vier@@ sen engaged in Central , P@@ acht@@ al agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of large districts .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , the power requirement of about 11 400 households will be covered - this corresponds with approximately one fifth of the power demand of all four @-@ four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Four@@ teenth town gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .

bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .

Tr@@ ump did after having sent from telephone calls from phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the bound@@ ary wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls from phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and Per@@ le@@ agues by Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump was called on a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned bound@@ ary wall .
the US President accused him , because he had the wall publicly quot@@ ed . saying , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern edge of the USA , and sw@@ elled to let Mexico charge for the project .
the trans@@ cription of his first calls with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ h@@ ight have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Rei@@ ff said that a trade for the US refugees trying to emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; and &quot; du@@ mm &quot; be and that the c@@ ess@@ ation on trade , which would be con@@ veys to him as a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after having said Mr Turn@@ h@@ stag , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists , run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice back
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and r@@ umped on the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had been able to reach the bridge , a group of white men cast out with v@@ ault in order to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle age in a needle @-@ stick @-@ march - took a long train at its cig@@ ar and looking forward by the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ soles are in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ aring the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
Schre@@ ie zer@@ ris@@ sen the silence , when a young black man by the passenger is dist@@ orted .
luckily this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22 , just a post@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; p@@ ouring almost all of them in the audience very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens go back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from the K@@ u Klu@@ by Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was charged on account of the Mor@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ concei@@ vable that in all these years no single person was arrested , although we know it in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks who helps in organising the after@@ math . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt in history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old congress of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him the post@@ ure as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been fixed .
&quot; we want prosec@@ ution , we want the ending , we want healing , we want healing , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tri@@ but@@ tering puts a du@@ el over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n@@ girl on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding areas are suspected .
but none were ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been working on an open foot for decades , citi@@ zenship , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , to give their vote in the summer their vote in the summer .
at about the same time as choosing the F@@ BI &apos;s black color but@@ cher Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - supp@@ os@@ edly because of a woman .
Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ or had been in the city that H@@ ester has slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby that contributed her , not by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent German land@@ owner , 600 Dollar to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins , Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey , to the prison .
but when they removed himself from the prison and then the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge appro@@ ached , Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b turned the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who has prepared and arranged Mor@@ de , closes this from an F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspir@@ acy between state and local prosec@@ ution , who was not only involved in the murder , evidence , and the identity of witnesses raised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks put it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a constitu@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass@@ ac@@ re &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you agree , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade of Cass@@ andra has led the annual post @-@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivi@@ d , ign@@ ant and is based in a kind of deep@@ est racism , of which many believe that he is no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to look at , and still harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we then have to face with it in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen or hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day there were almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black - into one room and listen , when a raft recorded a well @-@ played overview of the piece was started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ enes Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the C@@ lan@@ mit@@ ry for years but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh .
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story on life because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the tail scre@@ ams and it hat@@ red , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; I said n --- he , mer@@ gence of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ sel@@ dom is doing the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene lau@@ gh at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still mur@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t believe that white people back then &apos;@@ n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , we@@ aving is one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to meet the harsh &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shi@@ fts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this right not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four mur@@ dered people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , it says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman with a fun@@ eral dress is d@@ ressed , stands on the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and introduces Che@@ e Holidays gri@@ pping endeav@@ or &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
their voice breaks out with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spect@@ ators swe@@ at and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost even@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down only the road .
they all have almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the gra@@ vest@@ ments of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the Mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you place in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels s@@ cap@@ tiv@@ ated .
when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene loads the quantity to get closer and the ly@@ ch@@ name inspec@@ ted .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , regi@@ stering their counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other .
&quot; you are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ elt a little boy , as if he wanted to remember it .
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ chs@@ eil away and cry out their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ arm@@ t Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the nam@@ e@@ plate , who has played the c@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ sel@@ f@@ im@@ t two of his fellow @-@ players and then cr@@ ying them cr@@ ying in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per one of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience will get together with actors for dinner .
at one table , a white pair out from Atlanta was excited about the post@@ uring with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought hard to find words which has left the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... from people who look like you themselves and do what they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does this with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still goes on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s Hof at his table , he e@@ ats and reminds on civil rights .
he said he already began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ ure is in a certain way , because it describes the fri@@ ght of what we have end@@ ure , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I draw a positive attitude .
max quantity works as volunteers
they work at several locations in their volunteers .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in einf@@ urt at the furniture river , once a week I started out in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have worked on the school already in an open day @-@ day .
how are your experiences with it ?
amount : it is a nice , wide spectrum which I see here .
I have to do with different people , with juven@@ iles , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late job volunteer .
how does this come ?
quantity : I made S@@ LC .
and then a construction engineers , we say once , successfully ab@@ orted .
I have known for me that it &apos;s true for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I wonder@@ ed what do you do .
M@@ ach a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester at the winter term .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker @-@ training and graduate students in Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not something unusual , during the volunteer service several different approaches to have ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it is probably always up where you make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very diversi@@ fied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ care .
for me it was the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could see and see my own strengths , as it really proceeds .
An@@ ders in construction studies ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about to settle hi@@ ks .
one always has other people in the head who each have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee is whether a youth , who has been caught out of the family - you must always enter it in an individual way .
very interesting .
and you have no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so is life just .
Pear@@ son cur@@ f@@ ates further 3,000 jobs and cut the dividend to revi@@ ving the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will re @-@ create more 3,000 jobs and cut their inter@@ s@@ cri@@ ed by 72 per cent , as another restructuring programme will be started to overcome the pressure using which the company is facing .
the job@@ stri@@ fe , the Director @-@ General John Fall@@ on , predomin@@ antly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , announced in addition to its previous restructuring , which already lost 4,000 places .
Pear@@ son announced a plan to be paid out in May in a third week planning programme to raise a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business back by fast steps towards digital learning .
the company , which in the last month had expressed his involvement in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for fiscal year was unchanged , after spending 1 percent in the first half of the year .
con@@ vo@@ i @-@ attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO @-@ soldier with su@@ icide @-@ attack
a su@@ icide attacks has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldiers of N@@ ato and several other inju@@ red , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been inju@@ red , distributed a statement of N@@ ato .
confirmed local reports killed in the incident in the city of Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bom@@ bing ra@@ ids that Afghanistan met this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
the Monday k@@ ass@@ inated a self @-@ ass@@ ass@@ inated two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of N@@ ato , it is said to be the explosion on Thursday nights , as a joint Pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; people carried out improvis@@ ation . &quot;
the statement states that all the inju@@ red in a stable state and in the US military hospital are dealt with at the air@@ field of Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , which is known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July a su@@ icide @-@ car bom@@ b must be at least 30 people in a chie@@ fly district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they would have executed this attack .
on May 31st , a giant bom@@ bing began in the centre of the city more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the U.S. military forces went off the Taliban in its power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump are considering the number of US forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af gh@@ ani .
EPA returns to delay the delay of sm@@ ug@@ g normally for complaints
the U.S. Department of Environment Agency has a decision to toler@@ ate regulation of the Government of Obama who are oblig@@ ated to eradic@@ ate the states that sm@@ ug@@ ging the smooth@@ ness @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states the agency because of the in@@ mate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA approved the decision later on Wednesday to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zon@@ era 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency , with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ boss Scott Pru@@ itt in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pru@@ dent had announced the EPA in June the intention of EPA , to specify the O@@ zone specifications - in which in one part of the country &apos;s poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions must be defined , where in@@ cis@@ ions should be made to delay stric@@ ter air @-@ quality standards - in order to delay one year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , held on Tuesday k@@ esh on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is intended to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have spar@@ ked the back of the Democrats and Nature Reserve that are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the website of EPA has said that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can only reinforce the symptoms of as@@ thma &quot; such as as@@ thma .
Munici@@ pal wants community space
at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ ed lines the church decides in flight @-@ wing em@@ powers the establishment of a communal space in the future retirement system .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the lack of land is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
while it still has to last until the so far the church community belonged to the church council , but there is no longer a plan to plan for the project from a private investor to the project .
for this purpose there is a discussion of a common space .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat is offered , the community is going to arrive .
on the ground floor it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the common town sought to look at such a common room not only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ o@@ fair living , but open to the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failed to reconc@@ ile the decision by providing funds for the ongoing household already last autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the refurb@@ ishment area .
the establishment of a common range would be , T@@ j@@ ads reports , 60 percent by 30 percent .
the decision to sign@@ alling that to sign@@ aling the investor would throw him in this respect no bil@@ let between the legs , the finding that both pan@@ ni@@ ers - which is caused by ambient temperatures - as well as Pom@@ er@@ ach , which makes the iner@@ tia open and the construction of economic power@@ ing - as well as possible .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this supplement .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously happened to the Panel .
it is not that easy when it comes to community space .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many ones building that you are not prog@@ ressing so right now , that Leh@@ ne man comes out of the window from the window , says : &quot; I &apos;m struggling with it . &quot;
Yvonne Sta@@ iger would be interested in common areas - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a toler@@ ated sub@@ prevention in anyway &apos;s or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the purchase of the area one does not give rise to a grant , but may come a real , in the two @-@ case market , the bac@@ kl@@ ash is .
st@@ ig@@ ers application , to meet the decisions given accordingly , there will be three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , there is two counter@@ votes off the original program , including Stefan H@@ aller so sum@@ med up : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we order the decision , we make a big step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : h@@ ubs is sh@@ red@@ ded on road
at the qu@@ itting the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ long cyclists at the gar@@ ath captured by a car and badly inju@@ red .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year Langen@@ felder rose by 12.@@ 20 am with his bike on the bike path of the road Black Way from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the winner wanted to cross the road to the altitude of the street on the bushes .
a one in the same direction of car @-@ car leaders gave him priority .
as the Langen@@ felder on the road drove them , but he obviously did not appear on the counter@@ part .
he joined together with a car , which was a 66 @-@ year @-@ year assistance .
the man was hur@@ led to the streets .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought into a hospital with the ret@@ tu@@ gn@@ ation truck .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance enhancement in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in Har@@ z the nation@@ wide first &quot; star path &quot; is supposed to be developed .
this is planning the association ob@@ servatory San@@ kt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path is available in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to the information of many Har@@ z@@ visitors , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he uni@@ fying nature , science , movement and sport@@ y performance .
the members want to set up the planned route along the planned route and will inform about stars and star@@ charts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; installations in five to six locations in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ober@@ har@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ request leu@@ men St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the charts should be added by the Internet .
that is why a good mobile phone business plays a role in the selection selection .
even accessibility is a crit@@ erion .
later the con@@ servatory can be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the observer experienced a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star gets more lumin@@ aire than another , although he is much more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation can be a chosen star , and when it is best to see .
the association has already been operating at the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg built in Germany since 2014 .
the location in the heart of Har@@ z , the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany , as well as the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Galaxy and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galaxy were clearly visible with the naked eye .
since 2003 there has been an initiative of the promot@@ er Planet@@ arium Göttingen , something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the Planet@@ en@@ weg .
starting from B@@ har@@ ds hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the inside of our solar system , the Planet@@ en@@ weg leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the Astr@@ berg and to the astronom@@ ical ob@@ servatory and an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Munici@@ p@@ ality of Sed@@ na .
the ch@@ elen with the individual planets - including the Zwer@@ g@@ plan@@ eten de@@ gra@@ di@@ fied Plu@@ to at the end point - are placed precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink up so on a bowl of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters are within the sun approximately 70 centi@@ meters .
the entire distance of the planet we@@ m is good four kilometers .
while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march for the next fix@@ ation but would still last a year long .

after Gar@@ cias victory by a voting decision on the former four @-@ divisions world @-@ champion Ad@@ rien on Saturday in show@@ time both com@@ bat@@ ants are members of the Top @-@ Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it going to champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the couple of photos posed , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ a , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect scale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former pen@@ al weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have risen to Br@@ oner &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I want to go down on weight @-@ weight .
and he has to move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
these are demanding the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box@@ ing needs this battle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Klim@@ a asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that will fight the Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 Po@@ und debut in this year , in order to make a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their weight @-@ weight tit@@ el match in the forum on September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans were asked for him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and argu@@ ed later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , he ad@@ minister Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday &apos;s fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko was held with a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ battle Champion from River@@ side are very slow , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you did test the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum , which built himself up for his own struggle .
&quot; this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I have been waiting for the top &quot; Figh@@ ters , &quot; and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Last to tire @-@ plat@@ ter
during an accident on the A7 from Thursday afternoon four people were heavily inju@@ red .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira at 16.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in front of the junction is probably shortly after a tire plat@@ ter , probably after a tire plat@@ ter .
the truck with the right to the emb@@ ank@@ ment where he over@@ came and then lie on the roof at the GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ ST@@ RI@@ B@@ N .
the four in@@ doors - two adults and two children - were heavy inju@@ red during the accident .
during the first supply of the past by the rescue service , the A7 was suspended in direction north for about one hour , then the traffic could lead to the left strip on the left strip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dre@@ es chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that bringing the optimization of the defence formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was happy to be satisfied with the result , if not the two oppos@@ ites were on the 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites to much and we need to better adapt to Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge Mountains , the barrel @-@ chain is also to be optimized continuously .
and a gate after an un@@ cl@@ ash , the cav@@ al@@ ment do not want to be cat@@ ched even more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be so that no more than Michael ( ensing ) puts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is convinced that its team can even better cope with the experience in preparing the barrel chain , as with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ man Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure to be in the barrel chain on the half @-@ positions at KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Cast@@ elmann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; the requirement is that we are even better harmon@@ izing us and we don &apos;t afford to perform so many bugs . &quot;
of course , it also moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one decided to speak about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable start &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance may well be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can go on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly speak of a neat end of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of this , his co@@ aches wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the launch of the season of evalu@@ ations I take only after six to eight players , &quot; said Bet@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be dis@@ continued pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a we@@ ath@@ ering .
&quot; now they can start the season with a home play , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann thinks that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , since they had no serious and complete game like Fortuna against a asc@@ ension on the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 @-@ percentage where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ender of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
though guests from the Rhein@@ land is considered easier to favor@@ it on Sunday into the encounter last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take away it only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Funk@@ el , his balance sheet at just one defeat for an end from nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that you must hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; such is a statement that would be arrogan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subj@@ ected to a new method for medical assessment of its age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years of age . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( rid@@ t@@ sm@@ e@@ dic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started conducting testing last year .
they should be more precise in the assessment of age during the asylum proceedings , after the Swedish migrant authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations ) were critic@@ ized due to errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees .
until today , migrant sales has been mail@@ ed 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while further 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is question@@ ed .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are permanent during the past few months .
&quot; we do not see a huge difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local .
the high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have been over its age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there will be 44@@ 2 cases that &quot; suggest that the studied person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska dag@@ bl@@ ends the 5@@ 81 released results , they determined that in 243 these cases the person had been openly told that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age evaluation , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MR@@ T @-@ Record@@ ings made by Kni@@ ves , which are then analyzed for dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ized in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the End@@ ok@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they used sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t believe the type of measurement should be used .
the biological age in this way can be judged is very in@@ secure .
if we can &apos;t say it sure we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Go@@ er@@ sson from For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency considers the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , they can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child is un@@ correct as an adult .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are prog@@ ressing well .
on Wednesday , a seven tonnes were heavy from the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday .
&quot; we are very good in the time , it works great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Bau@@ manager at the Department of intersection and Transport in the Government of the Government Freiburg .
in April the works began at all three gentle bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
construction is planned for October and Easy is sure that the timing is respected .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge from concrete , which is d@@ ressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
as the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ constructed .
the two other bridges lead through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built out of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a h@@ tw@@ och@@ ka on the north side a 1,30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ els .
this is a bound@@ ary that is also used as a run@@ way .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is supposed to be a 2,20 m wide br@@ ück@@ els .
it is then that the pedestrian pass away .
the special thing is that it is about pre@@ f@@ ables , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the pat@@ ented Br@@ ück@@ els .
special finger@@ tips laid the embarrass@@ ed of Leit@@ ungen by the Bau@@ werk in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass @-@ fibre @-@ cable where many companies are connected .
the residents have been informed in advance of the work by a hand@@ book on the under@@ taking .
in addition , first fish and canc@@ ers had to be canc@@ eled .
for the bridges between the building and the umbrella in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic lights .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village , the road is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the Hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three sn@@ akes are combined with 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ ales in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est bei deutsch@@ em Pot@@ atoes
it is not so frequent to draw the parties on a rope , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ ce ) , coming together , which otherwise is difficult to put under a hat .
the parties in the camp of the Vol@@ can@@ als ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a wide alliance that shows on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ ales in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Boutiquehotel Stadthalle are invited to a poster &quot; large election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , together with Alexander Gau@@ land , formed the top duo for the German Bundestag , and the dep@@ uty member states of Stor@@ k .
but those , who are already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the after@@ math , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eif@@ el remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain square , will now take place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ rod@@ ite event in the Stadthalle .
a pretty picture that offers itself there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the World Forum , and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &apos; ur@@ deutscher potato that could also eat the Af@@ ales without any problems , &quot; says the woman who has brought him .
police has be@@ aten many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ; it also shows presence in the train station , which is only a few meters from the locations .
how did the Af@@ ales come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ ce Vol@@ can@@ ei@@ fel reports , he tried to ensure such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first wonder@@ ed in Dau@@ n , but there was a badge , because of the already built @-@ built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes does not have enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with views of the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 8 pm on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the Rh@@ en@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ ener , who are waiting for the Sp@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ as for the Bundestag , Alice &apos;s Wei@@ del , and the dep@@ uty chairman of the Stor@@ ch @-@ Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
unchanged is the police force , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour lasts the Af@@ rod@@ ite event , the guests of the court have a prolonged breath , but also there it is short after 9 pm .
the police can move down - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
ein An@@ hören mit dem Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i there in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kon@@ zer@@ te tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ kirche .
together with the Bulgarian @-@ Tromp@@ eter Miros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ tor &quot; meets classical German training with roots in concert music .
both Soli@@ sts are the winners and pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of many international competitions and have held sol@@ op@@ os@@ itions in European ais@@ les .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ t is at the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic Bell@@ i is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ sy is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire to cross the borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of the different gen@@ res .
this sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new gar@@ ment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; united with Bulgarian Folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz @-@ op@@ r@@ ator N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m , mix Classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating design work .
this core part of the program was presented only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogra@@ m has written this pecu@@ liar for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with its special acou@@ st@@ ics will be deliber@@ ately included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try all out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart completely open about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I add che@@ eses , I think , &apos; Oh what was cool , what comes as a neigh@@ bor ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the Horn@@ wood who had become her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately got bitter .
despite all , the am@@ sin@@ ette performer towards the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was serious in love with everyone whom I have posted .
or believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation Kri@@ sten gave Kri@@ sten to say that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been bew@@ il@@ dered or ham@@ pered .
I just liked it not to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially here , they suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school @-@ time , when they were rather dress like a Bu@@ b , &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really hurt me very badly .
when I eleven I said the kids , I would look like a book .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ gh@@ tened and ash@@ amed .
now , I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public sphere they do not like to their love life : &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way and let me angry .
and maybe some call me as un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before all the public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
. the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday morning at a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said govern@@ or Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a great pleasure ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I cannot help you if I am a more democratic govern@@ or . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; said Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised to be a HU@@ GE announcement in the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice not endor@@ sed the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .

For@@ bes notes that he possesses char@@ coal mining in five countries and inher@@ ited from his father a carbon business .
he is about 1,@@ 59 billion dollars worth .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday nights gave a statement in which it said , &quot; the Party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from being able to make our country back great . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of govern@@ or Justice in history is the announcement of govern@@ or Justice in history is the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , in@@ coming message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping @-@ sc@@ andal
the global leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian co@@ e , praised the Thursday what he described as an open exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to return to sport .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics , Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IAAF @-@ Congress at the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championship , that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said it &apos;s p@@ ity for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were car@@ ved from competitions , gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IAAF @-@ Congress for the maintenance of the For@@ bidden , which was recorded in November 2015 , after a report from the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) had found evidence on the subsi@@ dy &apos;s d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IAAF @-@ President Co@@ e said the Rep@@ or@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has seen in itself , that they have experienced some hot times and do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guid@@ eline was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spo@@ ilt system , &quot; he added
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start athle@@ tics at the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championship , which will start Friday in London according to the strict State criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IAAF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen said on Monday that Russia still meet some of the criteria for a re@@ setting .
Dro@@ geri@@ es were still inadequate and forbidden to work freely , he said re@@ por@@ ters in London according to a talk at the IAAF Council .

but he is also of high importance &quot; for a land which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said .
after the fun@@ eral service the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .

the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it says further in the message .

he worked on the Thames in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later woman , the sympath@@ iz@@ ations of the people always fle@@ e , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy state in his almost 50 @-@ year Reg@@ ency in the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ized .
my Danish project was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ k@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the pal@@ ate , which I smok@@ ed instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand social @-@ critical intelli@@ gent@@ sia , I could not hope for sight .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not ash@@ amed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Premier W@@ eil wants rapid re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP on the possible majority in Nieder@@ sachsen
pre@@ ten@@ se Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a swift re@@ election of the country , but doesn &apos;t want to withdraw .
because they spoke on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
previously , the surprising ex@@ iting of a Green party in Nieder@@ sachsen , the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) had over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the day @-@ day choice , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover thus lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the old Gre@@ ens MP El@@ ke T@@ westen ends up their move with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the election in its elec@@ toral candidates in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future at CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared it on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U Leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend his group to accommodate them .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Lower Austria , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new tag will be selected 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , the red @-@ green state government should now decide if it could ever go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil is however necessary for indispensable that the country decides on as quickly as its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on Tuesday about their further action .
the country @-@ Constitution also sees the possibility that the parliament con@@ du@@ cts the prime minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these options need to be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ges step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something k@@ uri@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the politicians in himself said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she grew as a p@@ endant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for a number of members for the return of their country @-@ convention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she receives her country &apos;s convention , which she has received over the green country , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the govern@@ ors Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presi@@ dents of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision from El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have deliber@@ ately decided not to give a speech in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even above the background that there were no differences of differences , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD @-@ lawyers Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the trans@@ ition of the East @-@ Sax@@ on parliamentary group of El@@ ke T@@ westen for the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote the commitment of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country tag .
the Austr@@ o @-@ West costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the politicians in place , &quot; in their ver@@ ily van@@ ity and in their fru@@ stration her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; critic@@ ized SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U compet@@ ed in Lower Saxony and tries to beat out these political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ ten@@ se CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ ktion@@ sh@@ ef Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler will recommend its urge to collect El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , thre@@ w his west , with face @-@ to @-@ face care@@ er@@ ings the result of the voting choice 2013 in 2013 .

agricultural producer in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contamin@@ ated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect against po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer rights and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ str@@ war@@ eh@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder represent the latest information on the respective eggs s@@ war@@ ms .
affected eggs should be anni@@ hil@@ ated or returned .
even though , after all , what we are currently aware , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di is taking the best possible crisis in crisis - all eggs are out of the offer , because the central role of the enlighten@@ ers from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really appreciated ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been appearing immediately , and since announ@@ cements in Germany it is in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessment can be retri@@ ev@@ able for consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade fair has the same as the manufacturer to bear care that the sold @-@ sold products are busi@@ ly and hygien@@ ically safe .
when in eggs the resi@@ dual content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not busi@@ ly .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time are not the factories to blame .
sitting operations and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the actual level of knowledge the factories is not immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must attri@@ bute them on the pres@@ ump@@ tu@@ ous illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is a little ri@@ rol@@ ment in the tr@@ ap@@ se .
is it missing only on the staff or also on the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
these were just the official controls that face the process .
the truth is also part of the fact that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled up to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why a consequ@@ ent explanation of such matters and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s prosec@@ ut@@ or in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are , of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have made many times a lot , I expect the responsible authorities to do a seam@@ less enlighten@@ ment .
is the regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m of food sk@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers and consumers have the right to access exclusively safe and competitive foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved ins@@ ect force in the food economy , consumer rights and consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ ed .
by the ar@@ ching means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers have got into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ law@@ ful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides in the attitude of living @-@ based animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be consistently working at all levels and working with high pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is inf@@ eri@@ ous and fully illumin@@ ated .
how to affect F@@ TA &apos;s financial rules on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ occupied issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s World News transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will be coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain by the UEF@@ A as the executive organization that has monitored the European game has the power , cre@@ ws from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules which have been launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A in Life , mean that you have to demonstrate that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( 262 million Euros ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar is received a sal@@ ary that will amount a number of ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PSG can make sure the money smoothly , so that N@@ ey@@ mar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy @-@ rich new@@ com@@ ic family of Qatar .
claim@@ ing must be a lot of money to purchase players but need to counter with legitimate obj@@ ections that allow them to break the break @-@ up point in their own business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that in their quest for success tremendous debt had passed on , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P lost its concentration on the debts of the club on the surveillance of their losses .
the change signi@@ fied that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then ran vigor@@ ously invested to improve the team and build a global brand - a tough@@ er case .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P award period , which until 2018 is running , clubs may accept losses in the amount of 30 million Euros .
and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen by the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor is Aleks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in still to cr@@ ying out of excessive spending .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P in front of The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PSG paid out the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ure , it can distribute the amount for b@@ illing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year treaty agreement , so that the resolution can be agreed for the next five years at the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 approved the PSG along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with most severe sanctions .
the PSG was given to $ 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was cut down to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the Mann@@ ing members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players will not be limited to usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is in search of clubs which could try to over@@ look their financial supervision by linked their income by companies acting with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ac@@ ic company could potentially enter the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ing the standard market rates would exceed the UEF@@ A this not as a legitimate income .
exactly what happened in 2014 , as the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was issued by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PSG payments to N@@ ey@@ mar come over payments of the World Cup 2022 into Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar have disp@@ uted that N@@ ey@@ mar WM Ambassador will be arranged and a such maneu@@ ver could simply figure out for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the recent sanctions imposed on PSG are that the UEF@@ A will still be more attentive to each attempt to observe the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PSG via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , fabulous on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .
the last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts for the last fiscal year will still need to be published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ sell &apos;s .
the association assumes that sales after signature by at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was clearly conf@@ uses to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claim@@ ing that he would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial d@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport in Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state which is financed by an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and it has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the past 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great player in order to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new f@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
Cho@@ col@@ at Frey abo@@ ard the Swiss made in the past few years .
now the close co @-@ operation faces a possible end : the airline is sending the order new .
Swiss @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the message agency , as a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
in accordance with current planning , the Air@@ line will initi@@ ate a new contract in the first half of the year 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subj@@ ected to one quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current suppliers Cho@@ col@@ at Frey we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small red @-@ white sli@@ ps panels of 14 grams to 14 grams per year , the air@@ planes in front of the landing to the passengers .
the Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs .
branch insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the order volume according to &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter reached an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more importantly the adver@@ sely is apparent : for a j@@ og@@ gi@@ ver it is an prestigious order .
how many applic@@ ants are there in the new ten@@ ders , the Swiss will not want to betra@@ y .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Frey wants to further advance a renewal of the contract regarding spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates was not available for an opinion .
chocolate charts are distributed over the Swiss since 2006 on board her flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with the native daughter , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had delivered with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablet .
the opportunity to place the logo conducted two years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
the airline works with different Swiss cho@@ col@@ ates .
at the long @-@ distance flights , customers of First Class were pampered by the Con@@ fis@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class Nas@@ chen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sh@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Frey .
recently , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is also distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Frey , both in Business and Economy Class .

nost@@ algia go into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the N@@ ian
this repet@@ ition of history is also a nost@@ alg@@ ically due to the glorious days of characters of the 80 @-@ years era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wer the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV rot@@ ten ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally an par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be tight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for an appe@@ aling cup of vegetables which by H. Jon Benjamin was spoken ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by acting on the core of the day - an actor of middle aged man - an actor could play children , which they grow , but still managed to reg@@ ain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years later , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his adults , who now play adult is less emotional , and his par@@ ody goes more after the casting principle , including a reef to the Stalin@@ ist films of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand Was@@ hing the Cr@@ adle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand , which illustrate the cradle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one point was a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ walter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wer ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a very successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as usual , EX@@ K@@ UR@@ SE is the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ en@@ bart von &quot; Singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it is the moments of adul@@ ter@@ ous mad@@ ness that could be like a kind of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion : &apos; WET Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years later , &quot; whose last scene will show the Ban@@ de , as it will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon might be reminded of another kind of nost@@ algia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the Film &quot; Atom@@ ic Blon@@ de &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ ing @-@ I@@ KO@@ NO@@ GRA@@ PH@@ Y .

the main roll@@ ers - a hard @-@ gentle Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of chann@@ eling Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some lovely walks for watching ( police are spending time to watch chess on TV , like Americans perhaps with soccer ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a dist@@ ressed propaganda wi@@ ama - a mur@@ derer who bears a re@@ ag@@ an mask , is often involved - that it is often like a single one .
for six long episodes it goes to that , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which has been re@@ arranged on a lower length , could lead his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef used to visit American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ oured a clu@@ sters .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to for@@ age for a schol@@ ar .
the fic@@ t@@ itious Romanian creator was not wrong : we make it even with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact of the drug @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ ka tomorrow were held in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart as numerous objects as well as the prosec@@ ution of prosec@@ uting on Friday .
at the age of 15 years 15 people were arrested and ar@@ rests in the ages between 25 and 77 and already ar@@ rest warran@@ t against them .
moreover , the police demanded greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundreds of thousands of Euros .
at the time of time Raz@@ or in Italy there were two people arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
the two will therefore be delivered to Germany pres@@ um@@ ably .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
altogether we were over 300 polic@@ emen in action .
the members of the Maf@@ ia is organised to fight against drugs , heavy violence , scattered murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and ext@@ or@@ tion .
even since summer 2016 , the prosec@@ ution has established the prosec@@ ution against organised drug @-@ trading in the South German area .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office in const@@ ancy and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the use of the grand@@ son will also be accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the Vis@@ i@@ ards of the investigations , above all Italian national , with a reference to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were un@@ folded in the morning in the morning , should go to the bank account .
affected large g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners tab in Germany has substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to some serious lack of lack in asylum @-@ procedures .
the representative for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen means , has made a media report about large g@@ aps in the off @-@ country register .
defects in the registered data could lead in asylum and deport@@ ations , &quot; some serious lack of lack , in an analysis that lies the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; .
in the Register , the statements are according to 10 million people with foreign nation@@ ality , including about 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long ago become more in life , or by citizens who have become the German citizen , and in the register are no longer emerging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty amounts of data can significantly slow@@ down significantly , &quot; it means the report continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about temporary people , EU citizens have captured all who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false assign@@ ments led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a crus@@ hed debate about dealing with travellers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is therefore obvious in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the Federal Government clearly has begun to return refugee family with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they returned from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this leads from an internal paper of the federal state for migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue Osnab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it is that the BA@@ MF lead such proceedings &quot; regarding families with children - except for inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper referred to a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees of the EU state to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason I write the office now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the admission capacity for families with min@@ ating children in Italy is significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy made for the reception and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ R ) is holding these commitments enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU countries would also return to refugees in the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inn@@ en@@ political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ized this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of decent work conditions , and a haz@@ ard of the child of childhood . &quot;

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0,25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and mit@@ igation on inflation must have a sharp rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; will remain &quot; as they kept the interest rates on family income in the midst of an increased pressure .
polic@@ y@@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank agreed with 6 to 2 , paying low interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members of this month , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened its support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly review report , the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , and warned that pressure on the autumn would continue to rise at just under 3 % .
but they sign@@ aled that over the next few years they would be necessary to breed by the Bre@@ xit would increase inflation and she said that the credit costs might cost more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut @-@ economic package that was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will require time to finance the funding plan to launch from the upcoming February cheap financial means for banks , though it was expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s decision on interest rate said the Bank : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) continues to be weak , as pressure on the real income of households continues to be charged to consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the interest rates shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain sp@@ ine of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to ev@@ acu@@ ate inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent that markets are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets , at present , they are expected to advance the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
however , the bank empha@@ sized that increases &quot; grad@@ ual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the resulting growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the growth forecasts published in May .
it continued its growth forecasts on 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell according to these messages compared to the dollar and the Euro .
the pound was about 0.5 % to 31 US dollars and fell by 0,4 % to 23@@ 8.@@ 15 euros .
the decision to not make any change after the recent dis@@ appointing growth rates have increased the increasing expectations for a fork @-@ height and GDP has risen by 0.2 % in the previous three months in the previous three months .
growth is expected to occur in the third quarter at 0.3 % , although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report proposed little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and low level in@@ feed , as the ti@@ ghtening first is getting worse before they get better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing monetary policy in the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will continue to recover from the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also reinforced by the rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak and attri@@ but@@ able , which is compens@@ ated for a part of lower consumption compens@@ ated .
the decision does a year after lo@@ wering interest rates on 0.25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU set @-@ up , which caused the decline of the sound .
the Bank is estimated that it will last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
before the last Jud@@ gment of the Bank on the interest rates the reputation was increased after a fork increased , since inflation climb@@ ed up pressure on hard and increased households , whereby three policy makers in July demanded an increase in 0.5 % .
inflation has declined in the last month of 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % although the Bank predicted that it was expected and will raise her again in the months to come .
the Bank said the exce@@ ed@@ ance in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; quite &quot; to sign up weak pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ reco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the shorter back@@ stage of sw@@ ap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the bor@@ is@@ ers would like to search for stores and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks very good for those with which the existing De@@ als exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages close , and many with toll free options and low cr@@ ats are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health service ) is meant to for@@ ge HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
patients will be granted after a struggle before the High Court against funding of the drug in the N@@ HS access to an &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV pre @-@ Pre@@ ventive treatment .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ ordin@@ ated pre@@ dispos@@ ed proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) which may decrease the risk risk to roughly 86 percent , now being supplied by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for valued 10,000 people .
he agreed to fund the process after the Appe@@ al Court had confirmed the authority of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year that the N@@ HS had the power to pay for pre@@ p despite the claim that local authorities should finance him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ endant was announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England @-@ leader Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) was referred to as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health hospitals in London , Brigh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first among people who will be able to sign up and to follow more clinics in October before it will be introduced in England in April 2018 .
pre @-@ positioning proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection drugs .
pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before the intercourse .
those who come to the treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated successfully .
in clinics , appropriate participants will be identified to agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ res and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be disclosed by anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a primary care physician can also register for possible participation in their local participating agents .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medicines during that week after an international competitive evaluation .
the study aims to assess the entire potential of pre@@ p by making clinical evidence as defined in a large scale , and is implemented .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV and over@@ hau@@ l HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p when it is targeted to vulnerable and endangered people , the opportunity to change the English HIV / epide@@ mic .
from September to people suffering from high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financial attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not with a negotiating with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p @-@ testing medicine was established , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , shadow @-@ Health Minister said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome after monthly , delays and hes@@ it@@ ant realization through the government .
the evidence show how transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention may be and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is done as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and to contribute to them that we make a step closer to bringing the spread of HIV to society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big living life : mezzanine and clever designer furniture have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court accommodation into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , won in 2014 by a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I sought after something that was similar to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceil@@ ings .
I have fallen in love with them and made an offer to that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square @-@ foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one bedroom estate with a screw@@ able layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and an intermediate space to make optimal use of the generous deck height .
&quot; I wanted high ceil@@ ings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; says she .
to this end she commissioned the Architektur@@ büro und Design@@ studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceil@@ ings to use and to create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the blan@@ ket was not big enough to place two spaces covered in one another so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate space where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the award .
&quot; the steel station is quite complicated , &quot; explained .
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so they were over@@ hau@@ led , without having had g@@ aps .
it was not just about building a simple platform , but to specify the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down the correct height . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height to place one another - with a lot of extra drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic cou@@ p@@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down to the gl@@ am@@ our@@ able residential area .
spra@@ ying gold furniture , silver , and vintage Serge Mou@@ ille L@@ igh@@ ting put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to leave him longer .
in the kitchen the mirror is felt like a window to another room .
at the entrance offer pi@@ eg@@ ted units place for all the seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ or@@ atory space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ d@@ able kitchen are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a clo@@ ak door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied MD@@ F door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , so if you are moving the door very easily , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agents will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the soil surface and use high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not forget you in the power so@@ ckets in the walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square speed from a bit as moderate in something quite amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar imm@@ unity
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former Director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business shall be divided .
Paul did not want to go back from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
along with her mother Anna , the brothers and family have accum@@ ulated at more than half a billion dollars , since the family has bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
here the family West@@ co Je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been investing in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is has offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her dead father , Col@@ in - by Paul as the main operator , and the domin@@ ating personality , &quot; in the family de Lut@@ is , about one third of the company , and Paul about a third .
a jurisdiction that implies , that Col@@ in is owned by 35,@@ 000 millions of dollars and Paul valued by 176 million dollars .
real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proposed resolutions have left him with which I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in his first aff@@ id@@ av@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place after several failed ass@@ essm@@ ents .
the brothers also struggle to control the existing business - including Col@@ in , such as Paul claims that excluded him .
col@@ in argu@@ ed that this is not true , but He casts Paul before , of ad@@ minister some poss@@ essions .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to present the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance was written that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides raised by law firms .
Ms. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought D@@ airy and Del@@ ik@@ at@@ ess@@ en@@ busin@@ ess@@ s from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they took the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood @-@ property where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is said that she and Luigi who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed her property to pass on her sons in 2012 .
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group , where Col@@ in maintains that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars have been paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has lasted very much , although he was a former AF@@ L pre@@ board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lut@@ is and her attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in rep@@ lied with SMS to say &quot; I can really not say a lot , &quot; because the case in front of the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother has decided to acc@@ use me and drag our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not have said that Paul and I would end in our current contest , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said , saying that he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope appeared to be past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump@@ tion of new St@@ ef plant is planning to restrict the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Polit@@ ico tells us that the new leader of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the message media - in the hope to keep the boss on a minimal course .
here is a piece of Rep@@ orter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as John F. Kelly , the new leader of the White House , called on his first working day with leading staff , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to fix : poor information , which got into the hands of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
cell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media channels .
President Tr@@ ump@@ suits on TV dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ite is still strong .
&quot; if can@@ did@@ at Tr@@ ump was up@@ set because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of positions obtained , &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ or Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite the Polit@@ ico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ icos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep t@@ ens Twitter habit under control , according to six former elec@@ toral campaign to ensure that his personal media intake involves a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter habit ever &quot; under control &quot; was , is ridicul@@ ous .
maybe this campaign os@@ cill@@ ors know something that we don &apos;t know other - that dru@@ pe twe@@ ets would have included more ign@@ itions without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that has not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his employees have made it out of him for several times , will keep away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has to prevent it from consistently that sn@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y is produced .
a part of the problem is that the people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by producing their dump material that may help their views from the world .
Polit@@ ico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ er , the president of strategic grounds of du@@ bi@@ ous information .
this was an example which was described by the Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump Beam@@ te say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press pages , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks , and that he gets out to find out how they come from .
that was what happened at the end of February when someone replaces the president mal@@ icious one of Article from Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ Prov@@ ok@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who proclaimed the dep@@ uty leader in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a p@@ ile of &quot; le@@ ak &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson were banned from Twitter because of pic@@ ks , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then St@@ allion Lic@@ ent@@ ef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document a system in order to get the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that worked ?
Kelly tries to do the same for three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as the priest , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors always strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
dormit@@ ory crimin@@ als get Post from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the assistance of the people will pray and raised .
the police throughout Europe are mail@@ ed this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous crimes on the run .
as the addresses of the sear@@ ched s@@ eb@@ re@@ aker are not known , they are given advice from the population and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday by the action , which follows the &quot; EU for W@@ anted &quot; Adv@@ ent Calendar of winter .
the experiences have shown that many vol@@ ts are hi@@ ding in holiday destinations , this was called the part of Euro@@ pol .
one has put together 21 post@@ cards for following crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website of www@@ .e@@ surrounds , over 2.5 million times it has been seen .
36 of the online sear@@ ched have so far been noted , at least eleven of them due to hin@@ ts of the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ age series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands meet again with some resol@@ ute travelers on war@@ fare that have negotiated one of the church drawn tow@@ ed dit@@ ch in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their sovereig@@ n homes .
the travellers have named their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , who is called the &quot; milli@@ on@@ ous series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , after they have only been abandoned in May without being deter@@ red by one of the council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch , in order to prevent their accidents .
the tacti@@ cal group found a gap in the defence force and expressed its vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a path .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the advice of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless is to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said , &quot; They are on the assembly evening , after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they cast lots down onto the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by sh@@ am to implement into effect as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May . they were moved and are now back .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle a long under@@ statement in order to protect their parks .
I live on the stre@@ ets@@ bro@@ ok Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my church dest@@ ress if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
a community who did not want to be called said , &quot; It &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , we have just seen the last round of this trav@@ eller only to be lo@@ oted by another round .
the figures have raised this time and you even have a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of a un@@ authorized camp on the country beyond the wor@@ mw@@ bro@@ ok Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ master@@ l . we take the necessary legal steps to move it as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to assist our arguments , it is very important that most people call on an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in polic@@ emen by calling them 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof there will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house against the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and is expected to be opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the dam@@ aging ambience of the Association , the 13th of April 2014 was lost around 30 000 nights per year and also revenue by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatic figures for refugees who arrived at the county coun@@ cils , the hotel building in the country hall is offered as collective accommodation , which was cat@@ ered for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions .
the city fet@@ ched the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting a development plan in order to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not disp@@ uted at that time in the council .
but in particular , Fre@@ den@@ stad@@ ts of the bourgeois @-@ bourgeois Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location , and already spoke of serious interested in the house at that time .
he should maintain right .
the Group Lu@@ isen@@ ist hotels with leader in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been a long period of construction , and when you enter the house , it will clear , what extensive renovation works are made .
so@@ ils have been made out , blan@@ kets to cover part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ style .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ built showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , there are new windows attached .
everything must be &quot; nice &quot; close to &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms want to speci@@ alize , will be explained in more detail .
both vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or busin@@ ess@@ men should feel at home in the hotel .
talks with OB Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourismus@@ dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already managed , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
looking forward to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine precisely .
just under one million Euro , he reck@@ on .
even the outside systems are brought into fore@@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant that is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre : us Sonder@@ angebote und Grand Jury ein
in the Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre um US @-@ President Donald Tr@@ ump , special insurance Robert Mu@@ eller shall be used for a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
in the past few weeks the Panel took up the work in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to deal with the thing trusted persons .
the paper weigh@@ ed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extends and intensified its investigation .
the CN@@ N channel reported it already reported first instructions of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums associated with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ tion son and Russian attorney .
us intelligence services accused the Krem@@ lin since long , dealt with in the presidential campaign 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there was agreements between the tr@@ umps election campaign and Moscow .
in the investigation of the investigation , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to this report , Mu@@ eller also reported more and more tr@@ umps priv@@ ates and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote some weeks ago that the special mid @-@ party Tr@@ ump has pe@@ ach in the center and I &apos;m looking for the accus@@ ation whether the president in the course of the affair may have ob@@ struc@@ ted the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and determine this evidence in possible inter@@ ruption , and to decide whether the prosec@@ ution should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called dock .
mostly they will be swit@@ ched on , if it is larger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure is always behind closed doors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Panel can also be swit@@ ched from the prosec@@ ut@@ or to take people on the hearing of E@@ ide .
according to the CN@@ N channels , pre @-@ lad@@ ungen have already been issued which was about the encounter of Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian leader .
individuals who were involved in the meeting may be called upon a statement , it was called in the report .
furthermore , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. were also tr@@ umps advis@@ er and father @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed Kus@@ h@@ ner as well as his dam@@ aging election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday nights in US television that show the inst@@ ant@@ ation that Mu@@ eller let himself go out in his work and that he should be necessary , if it would be necessary to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned to the end to decide on the survey of an indic@@ t@@ ment .
nevertheless , the introduction of the body is at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump .
among the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday nights received a speech in West Virginia , to present the Russia @-@ Aff@@ äre as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b said in an opinion , he didn &apos;t know anything from the installation of a Grand Jury .
but this work also usually in obe@@ di@@ men , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House feared all measures that acceler@@ ated the work of the Special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey told three times that not the president is determined .
you have no reason to believe that something has changed by it , it says in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been deplo@@ yed after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fallen .
because of this ration@@ ale , pre@@ aches have turned against tr@@ ump out loud , he will hin@@ der the judiciary .
Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him to be an attitude of investig@@ ators against the then national security advis@@ ors Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
after depic@@ tion of US media , the White House raised material for the special team and its employees .
the sol@@ dering spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to be released .
unlike an independent Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ent of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , where then , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could pro@@ ff@@ ed theoretically at the pres@@ ump@@ tions of the President of the State Department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bend that step but &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic transm@@ issions set out on Thursday , after which the special party could no longer be released so easily .
Antarc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg is in the Antarc@@ tic
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg was solved by the barely si@@ eben@@ times size of Berlin of the Ro@@ gue .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institut for Polar - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
having a tr@@ illion tonnes heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large KO@@ LO@@ SS t@@ rei@@ be now to the north and will need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , one of the biggest Eis@@ gig@@ antes , the researchers in the past three decades have registered .
a danger for people is not coming out of him .
how climate change has played a role in the inter@@ ruption of the ic@@ eberg , is un@@ clear according to researchers .
but in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of iron d@@ als in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact @-@ background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to the ground@@ work .
the KO@@ LO@@ SS now been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fig .
Schel@@ del@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks up regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ fig is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
north of the Ro@@ gue was the balance of w@@ axes and ab@@ orting a few years ago .
a complet@@ ful Schel@@ del@@ er was there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is some fact that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is in danger , because the more advanced edge has never moved back as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate stand under voltage and could dis@@ integrate , if at a key@@ point a piece is a piece .
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ sol@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , since they pus@@ hes on the water and pus@@ hes ice so much water as it gives after mel@@ ting himself .
however , the loss of the Sh@@ red@@ ness is that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can tran@@ sp@@ ins directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly result the sea level , however only in a little degree , the British research project write to the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s is after A@@ WI @-@ data with nearly 50 000 square kilometers , the fourth biggest stra@@ igh@@ s of the Antarc@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean roughly 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and not a direct connection to climate change , the ice sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British Sw@@ an@@ sea University .
&quot; this is the most advanced withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; he confirmed .
among scientists may be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ sol@@ s now continue to grow again or in the long run and potentially f@@ ou@@ ted , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers have not shr@@ ink the break@@ down of this gigantic ice @-@ ber@@ gs in the climate change , so in the last decades much of the Antarc@@ tica can be destroyed of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula .
this long bri@@ cks of Antarc@@ tica covers the South of South America .
according to data from the research program British Antarc@@ tic Sur@@ vey , the polar area of the Antarc@@ tic peninsula has declined since the 19@@ 50s to 28 000 square kilometres .
there was a decline in terms of temperature developments .

CD@@ U intends to run as a trainer
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy @-@ free places , the CD@@ U calls on to exchange from the Emplo@@ yers &apos; Association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the chal@@ k took 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration of M@@ ett@@ mann .
now once again 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day .
the courses in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 620 can@@ ings were to be scattered for the places this year .
nevertheless , the circle will continue to be able to cope with the desired requirements and tasks .
there is currently in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann , still in front of 50 .
among other things , physicians and engineers , as well as forces of the general administration .
the CD@@ U now aims to seize the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and now take the lead of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is to work out a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development according to the desire of the parties . &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term need for specialists , but to counter@@ act on the future @-@ oriented of the applic@@ ant .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and out , concrete measures for cross @-@ qualifications and include an educational model , calling for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach after a good approach .
because the circle has a lot of staff to do , which you did not know before .
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is on a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public employer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , a high number of employees , the disease or alter@@ s@@ out may be eliminated from the service .
highest time for action so that no more positions remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party even beyond the common request .
he discovered long ago in the cra@@ ft@@ day for a f@@ ist surprise when he asked the human resources to question publicly and the rest of the parties were flo@@ cked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nations wants all the opportunities to be ver@@ ified that allow a withdrawal from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; communist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if we cannot find a satisfactory solution here in short notice , the county seat should be with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the nation@@ ality cities - a pet , &quot; thus peoples .
thus , the CD@@ U tried to better pay the employees and officials when the collective bar@@ code is actually fores@@ een for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exact prescribed , increases or more money there is only when you switch to a higher level which is oriented at work years .
but the tasks of the circle has grown more and more over the past years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees are responsible for the provisions of the new pro@@ st@@ itutes master law .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , including Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ ktor Martin Richter a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone into NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned that the bail@@ boats for migrants in the Mediterranean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned that they will not continue to continue when they do not comply with new rules on their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not submit any new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said indoor Minister Marco Min@@ nit@@ i in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La STA@@ MP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ nit@@ is warning came one day after the Italian authorities had sei@@ zed a boat from the German aid organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth S@@ aving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because their team worked together effectively with trafficking collectors in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only for a year , refused to express an exhau@@ sti@@ ble alleg@@ ations of the Italian national state Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry to operate at the moment in the search and rescue operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can verify all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; youth R@@ ettet &apos; that supervis@@ es the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October .
it is assumed that his occupation is infl@@ atable migrants &apos; migrants that will be supplied to them directly by human dealers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gler can desc@@ end so that ships can be used again .
just such a meeting , was supp@@ os@@ edly only 1,3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the Law of the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of ev@@ apor@@ ates over the authority of the Italian coastal Guard , who supervis@@ es bail@@ out percent@@ ages in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other mot@@ if@@ s .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must above all have an Italian police police on board that supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Acti@@ va Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ law@@ ful , but acceptable , since they would not bring about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their bail@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate @-@ organization doctors are without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ nit@@ i said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ nit@@ i said that the number of migrants went back to rescue operations in Italy in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and the cooperation with local citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Citi@@ zens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for more talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and by Ch@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga are for e @-@ sport
will the sport @-@ stars in future be sitting in front of computer soles , instead of getting swe@@ ating in the wind and weather through the stadium ?
fact : e @-@ Sport has long been a serious industry to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high speeds .
these also have recognised the first federal lig@@ ament , which are increasingly being engaged in this area .
the beginning of 2015 made the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which established a E @-@ Sport Department in mid July and two professionals for computer game FIFA 17 under contract took .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire a brand new target group for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ mo@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that on this turn he is even going to rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coming weekend , the World Cup Association of FIFA in London is organizing the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs are confronted with each other .
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven are qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ y sees great potential in the E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ able a agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real soccer has to say in particular with the 14 @-@ 30 year @-@ old that young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the attempts to con@@ quer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , .
with prominent electric sport@@ s@@ men under contract , you might be able to be online much more often on these markets than once in the year to send the Federal Office to Asia once a year .
what is the exact thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the computer games computer games like &quot; League Of Leg@@ ends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competition levels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , like in normal sports , li@@ ds have established , in which the pros can compete against each other .
and in Asia , E @-@ Sports is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly ordinary .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ous has been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne is E @-@ Sport , because he is prof@@ ici@@ ently and many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased cardi@@ frequencies , stress action , hormonal changes .
moreover , it need cogn@@ itive abilities , a technical and tacti@@ cal understanding and a quick responsi@@ veness .
professional g@@ amer should not only be at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit@@ ter player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ oping is becoming ever more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
control controls are difficult for online play , and in the scene un@@ fail@@ ing the structures of classical sport .
the scientists rate the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the way international and this is like a large global family , there are no inter@@ cultur@@ ally shirts .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte , and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Rel@@ ein@@ ment software ( BI@@ U ) adds an rapid growth ahead of the E @-@ Sport .
in 2016 , Germany have been implemented 50 million euros in Germany , primarily on advertising , sponsor@@ ship and major tournaments .
in three years sales will be around 130 million .
about the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga are too little .
however , be the E @-@ Sport &quot; no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant .
international are many countries already further .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball ho@@ op Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the U.S. team n@@ RG @-@ ports .
Hollywood @-@ Schauspieler Ashton Kut@@ sche invested in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too much in Europe is doing a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sports was introduced as educational , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations according to Dut@@ y has meanwhile committed to setting a E @-@ Sport section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Executive Board of Rö@@ mer@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only in nost@@ algia to fall short , and the old days to be clar@@ ified , today is no longer enough .
it &apos;s about preserving the tradition of the association , but to align the company on the modern market at the same time .
&quot; we are living in a digit@@ ised world , &quot; says Dut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no doubt that only when football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy kick @-@ off to su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend to su@@ icide through lyrics and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to currency .
Carter was sentenced in June because of the per@@ me@@ able k@@ ill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is uns@@ ur@@ ned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy did a psychological illness .
in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ ature colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ oriented eyes when it was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have re@@ done Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility taken &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Car@@ ters attorney said it was a &quot; terrible struggle , whom they are completely de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot;
judge Gre@@ et : however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or ty@@ eg@@ rad , or all their cl@@ ergy , have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ ut@@ or read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , said that there is no day at which I smok@@ ed not the loss of my beloved Son .
I want that he is proud of me and as I per@@ ish with everything . I try , despite all of my p@@ ains that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roche &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosec@@ ution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she will never be part of the wedding of her brother or being a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no longer have this only person to have been working with me since my birth is a pain that I will keep in mind for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit a different icide , committ@@ ing su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy in 2014 was dead by a carbon mon@@ oph@@ onic po@@ ison@@ ing in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention to Him@@ self after Car@@ ters appear , revealed by the text that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g dich , spr@@ ink@@ le of a building , make you yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she told us in several messages that she had been sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention studied by the death of Roy , and ord@@ ained that by any press they would benefit from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few , the Carter defended , belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 because of the murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before being released two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich were allowed to open at the Audi Cup as a captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup @-@ winner has a big season - Extra motivation , as not .
something that was different at his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even though the extra clothing piece was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , there was of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er to see , he made himself cl@@ amp@@ ed bin@@ aries on his arm .
&quot; the coach did not have announced , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup tournament , after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain .
good , the agreement could have been better run than with the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of Coach was able to interpret K@@ imm@@ ich as well .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was in the youth play@@ ful , de@@ co@@ aches and straight out of the holiday have been chosen existing C @-@ El@@ f as player leader , but he .
sugar@@ s are distributed in the de@@ ar@@ est to those who you are much z@@ ut@@ ra who wants to keep in mood .
who@@ ever has been au@@ ser@@ ked , the heritage of Lah@@ m can only take advantage of a small Extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player to take over responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right rear , this is now its position , the white dri@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich in this start@@ led formation like the one who can take the ruin of the best in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played trou@@ pe .
he had the look for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .
Vid@@ al , to over@@ ride his missing fitness ( pop@@ up hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus began to establish the achievements of Asia @-@ travel ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le so , in their first appearance at the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot will not be negative .
this is all folding quite well .
Sü@@ le ran along with K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y prior to the defense , both ag@@ elled sovereig@@ n .
the well @-@ occupied Napoli @-@ storm is often hard , moreover , Sü@@ le tried to take up a few times in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave to the fact that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we expected it to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed his debut a decent performance .
game shift , Tem@@ ples : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
how unusual this Bavaria &apos;s world is still for the in@@ appro@@ achable , one looked after the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rud@@ y , for instance , were not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich went away after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
there , he cons@@ ented of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; what is going here I have now noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not need to bring the new one more .

designed often to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the land and the regional economy , when Evel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic minist@@ ries from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in office after more than a year , in which the new economic Minister Volker W@@ iss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
sp@@ amm@@ ers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ Pur@@ chase request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ur the old government .
Frank N@@ atus , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; W@@ iss@@ ing attacks the wishes of the economy , &quot; the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt &quot; has blocked .
the biggest turn@@ around sees N@@ atus in the infrastructure policy : the L@@ ück@@ en@@ closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now very close to the country &apos;s primary list .
again this year the Ministry hopes for a new creation process until 2021 should be the building right .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West um@@ ber@@ ing Trier , which is under the pres@@ sive requirement of the transport .
the aim is to take the circuit in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ an@@ spre@@ y Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
N@@ atus sees it a way to post regional , but internationally competing company .
the Chamber of Industry and Trade Chamber ( Chamber of Commerce ) Trier , like von W@@ iss@@ ing stim@@ ulated , at the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase the sales volumes in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .
in addition , W@@ iss@@ ing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company lo@@ aves the Chamber of Industry .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier looks in the new Master @-@ Bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
provided is an awar@@ ding of 1000 euro for the most sophisticated Master examination and 2500 Euro , if gradu@@ ates are self @-@ employed within ten years of the Master &apos;s apprenti@@ ces@@ hip .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road building , be quick facts to create , at the same time it faul@@ ts the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , captain of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers , that W@@ iss@@ ing wants to set mobility in the local operation are only 29 bodies yet occupied .
the Chamber of Industry demands to increase orders to external offices .
CD@@ U Fra@@ ction Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the b@@ illing station , the country invest@@ s 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in receipt of state roads as proposed .
Frank N@@ atus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the previous broad@@ band &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; broad@@ band &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 Diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a bac@@ kl@@ ash
one day before the announcement of Audi told BMW that it would be offering to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Group said , &quot; The company is the opinion that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and then moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described entrepreneurs as rec@@ alled .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance of carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ s and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for the neutr@@ alising of diesel engines prepared to install , take also what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also be charged with p@@ inn@@ ate the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to prevent the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ated devices that regulate the emissions when a car was tested , but when normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery , and could be put to court in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was involved in German criminal investigation , after the authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Audi accused , having installed a system to deal the emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen heavy in the study : the luxury automobile manufacturers contributes propor@@ tionally to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ons@@ asen and the lau@@ gh of the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was temporarily one of the best @-@ released Car@@ to@@ on illustr@@ ator , the b@@ oll@@ n@@ oses of his figures are its trademark .
also with 85 points of the Argentin@@ ian still and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; For there are too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he made himself an artist himself as a dra@@ ft@@ ish list - which was frustr@@ ated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when in my job lost , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60s , he managed to finish his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then also in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China found Mor@@ dil@@ lo many fans .
and again , the artists of cities inspire you to inspire .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures called in drawings by the Sch@@ ie@@ fen Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he has according to his own information according to the character still today , working on a daily basis for almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross und Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Plus@@ hes and watches are still finding a lot of spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon animations and a TV series with his figures .
the main person at the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in its drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ s@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures are speaking in the 3D @-@ Film , which aims to come to the Kin@@ ol@@ ein@@ wall .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore it is more likely to rely on the TV series , which is produced as his original design@@ ations .
lav@@ ender from Provence is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is due to the stra@@ ig@@ re of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases of communic@@ ating insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the farm Institute &apos;s CRI@@ E@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in the past few years has put the effects of climate change , which in spring has had a lot less rain and in autumn much more .
this has effects on lav@@ ender life .
there is also a small f@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwer@@ g@@ zi@@ k@@ ite sur@@ passes , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil lo@@ bes not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics highly .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have less parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of the dar@@ ker from the ground , but also the improvement of plants with a protective blend of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the City Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ür@@ ing@@ an R@@ hö@@ n celeb@@ rates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalists under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet with tw@@ o@@ chs to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what more secure it feels : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or at home .
security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ por@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdom@@ en .
there are drugs , politicians , busin@@ ess@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the outside list of the government or map , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no re@@ pri@@ eve of violence , and throughout the country the bodies pil@@ es of violence are more and more journalists . at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to have triggered the position in December 2012 and threats now existed at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is their publisher and their inspir@@ er from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is perceived deeply , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , that shows its middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , who demonstrate its smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porter debate about their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although in 2010 it was established by the Board of Directors to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee , the Committee adopted only two criminal off@@ ences according to the Committee under the Committee .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year are linked to drug @-@ trading and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists will rarely be brought before justice .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are uns@@ ur@@ ned , and although the terrain is now still mur@@ der@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of safety has little utility , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to wast@@ ing my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as we do not know the Why , we distr@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of the 15th of May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive it just a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ ol@@ la was raised by two men . he was shot out by his car and 12 times was shot on him , pres@@ um@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ öl@@ th river . &quot;
the sk@@ ar@@ cher ran away in his car and damaged it close by .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ours do not have to move freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ ar@@ rests in the past year and the delivery into the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the most bloody batt@@ ling areas of the country since ri@@ val@@ ed fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of reduced , two @-@ story mouse @-@ pi@@ geon for drug @-@ rounder , which are bigger than many houses for the Living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder of murder .
first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val@@ ing cardboard fr@@ actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected gang@@ members bought each specim@@ en of the output , as soon as they were delivered to time zones .
the second fault lies in these , Val@@ dez does not force them , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his k@@ ill@@ ings is seen as a milestone in the mex@@ ican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues ann@@ ah@@ ate that he would always be there .
he was a senior re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without sacrific@@ ing to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ ow@@ ry issue &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time the newspaper has earned a reputation because of the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and promotion .
they loved to publish hard @-@ reaching investigation without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories , which no one dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot award for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez has won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists during the persecution of Mexican drugs history , wherever they go .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live further , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drugs trading in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you need to take the task of having to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done with so many still@@ eries ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was flu@@ ent to a do@@ ck@@ workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and ratings , a teacher who knew how to survive .
it trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , going and sit there at the same table .
now ask them , was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also comp@@ elled them to ask their own assump@@ tions , how they can best handle their work and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their cann@@ y run@@ - and run@@ ways , &quot; to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ o@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high measure of self @-@ relationships and self @-@ holding .
tru@@ sting his own instin@@ cts .
if it smells , lead it away .
the trouble is said the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the matter with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activ@@ ist in Mexico .
outside there were two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ scale building in a mid @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half of the bai@@ z , some of the re@@ por@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who were the govern@@ or themselves as not trusted .
it has been months since the Rep@@ orter has gone to the mountain scenery , where the drugs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has been on three main stories .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Br@@ ders of the former known Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a wedding on the citi@@ zenship , which focused on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group that is at one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the state @-@ old , a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it came to pass , so caution was taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally produced by drugs and authorities .
a re@@ por@@ ters from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who belongs to the governing Institu@@ tional revolution party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the whole century of all political hierarchy .
recently , several Pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about pre@@ mat@@ ures in this e@@ at@@ ery , including a , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; was escap@@ ed from military attack .
only a few months before , the reader had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the ab@@ duction .
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and stick@@ ers protest@@ ing against the Mor@@ de of journalists who have become something they themselves were never expected : activists in the name of the press .
Rep@@ or@@ ator Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez schn@@ app@@ te a few signs and went over the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the state @-@ old .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez has been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in all the country journalists have spoken much more by entering the protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sal@@ aries and construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this day the director &apos;s Bo@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case Val@@ dez .
in a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the murder of Val@@ dez accused , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities , journalists and release them because they have said the truth .
she has since asked that she is once again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objecti@@ vity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico by organised crime to be surrounded by government officials and a common society . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journalist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters will not only be killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security gu@@ ards that accompanied by organised crime under a ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico do you because they wish to sne@@ ak the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the mor@@ de have a terri@@ fying effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the Blog@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern bor@@ der@@ line of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their body was found together with a note that was supp@@ os@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am , because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer @-@ keyboard and ear@@ phones in addition to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to include , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of the correspon@@ dent of lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as there were El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Cologne after the murder of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug card with an editorial guidance on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are f@@ lown out of their native states or even out of the country .
it is a painful .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are h@@ unted as evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer of Rub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , the 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ ranging decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who wanted to be poet , indicates that the drug @-@ stores make him scar@@ ed .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
to midnight on Friday last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all of their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to sum@@ s .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ ages and security gu@@ ards near the bathing Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
war escal@@ ated on how it was promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
on board basis , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
sir@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Boj@@ or@@ qu@@ ez thre@@ w a look at the police officers , the che@@ ache , to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid they did not show it .
below the terrific portrait of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day where Javier has been mur@@ dered , the practi@@ c@@ ant asked me to send it to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs spac@@ ing cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to avoid its enemies .
at first glance it looks like a statue , though a sc@@ ary .
now researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ horn of a Canadian mountain worker has been so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his schu@@ pp@@ y skin was from Roman Braun - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; quite peaceful past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fos@@ sil is a newly discovered species of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k , between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
be incredibly well preser@@ v@@ ed. state has expl@@ orer it as &quot; truly remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the ge@@ ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ fres@@ ser is the best preserved Fos@@ sil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was mine at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something of the surrounding isl@@ ets was lacking on the square , and decided to look more accurately .
he discovered the Fos@@ sil in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years , the wild beast within the 2,@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) to un@@ cover heavy stra@@ w@@ ling .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be unveil@@ ed .
&quot; if you just take a little bit with the eyes , you could almost think that it has slept , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the cre@@ ature is visible .
&quot; it will enter into the science &apos;s history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ fres@@ ser , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and res@@ embles , probably of meat @-@ prov@@ oked din@@ osau@@ rs .
the highly skilled din@@ osau@@ rs used one red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shield , which is known as counter @-@ circum@@ cis@@ ion , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix more in its surroundings and to do@@ dge its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old cre@@ ature from the family of N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs has made head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animals and called it Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta res@@ in to the Muse@@ um@@ st@@ echni@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours in order to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specim@@ en , there was Dr. Mitchell , and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sc@@ ales and arm@@ aments about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a widespread defence method in the animal @-@ rich , meaning that the tip of the cre@@ ature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising , since the size of the real @-@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exce@@ eds the animals living in today .
it points to that the din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by enough pressure due to meat @-@ sent din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution that fav@@ oured the conce@@ al of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the counter @-@ sh@@ aded - think of deer , Zeb@@ ra or G@@ ür@@ t@@ una - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey , that sign@@ aled that this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong rob@@ ber @-@ behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs , how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ans have to be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sk@@ als also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs was red .
scientists still examine the animal on information about his life , including his conc@@ er@@ ected intest@@ inal cord to figure out what it has eaten up as his final meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , went into a river served and driven out into the sea , where he s@@ ank on the back to the bottom .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today .
&quot; this N@@ od@@ osau@@ rs is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative skin , but also in three dimensions and the original form of the beast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outcome is that the animal looks almost exactly the same way as in the early cra@@ yon period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need much imagination to use it to re@@ construct . if you just take a little bit with your eyes , you could almost think he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k was a time , as a huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , who stood on two legs , the earth raised .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions of years after Bo@@ re@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was h@@ unted by some of its fri@@ gh@@ ted ancestors .
to this cause belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tonnes he@@ avier monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal of Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried after death in the sea and in mud .
the cre@@ ature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was mine at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is entirely off the mu@@ zzle until the thig@@ h .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that rag@@ ed from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the pan@@ dem@@ ic plant @-@ fres@@ ser was s@@ war@@ med by Western Canada until a flood@@ ed river flood@@ ed down to the open sea .
but the underwater ill@@ um@@ ination of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the hidden remains of this special specim@@ en are so well preserved that the skin @-@ fi@@ sts still den@@ oted mot@@ ran@@ ces along the din@@ osau@@ rs
like Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko , for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of preservation so &apos; rare like a win in the Lot@@ to .
the more I throw it , the more con@@ dens@@ ation it becomes .
hidden remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank plates that carry the skull of the beast .
its right foot @-@ fu@@ ck lies on his side , his five fingers are split upwards .
I can count the shed on his sole . &quot;
in the Thunder : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wo@@ unded
veh@@ ement accident on Thursday nights on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass@@ ages .
there are numerous wo@@ unded , long distances - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on Thursday morning at a mass @-@ head age approximately 20 people have been inju@@ red .
according to the first information of the police were around 17 o &apos;clock between the connecting Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( county of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , including even truck @-@ wag@@ ons .
the exact number of the recent years do not contain any information before .
it is a slight to medium @-@ heavy injuries , said a pol@@ ze@@ out pre@@ z@@ cher .
a large b@@ illed for lif@@ ebo@@ ot@@ vehicles was at the Un@@ fall@@ out station .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in Munich .
in the Munich Law of Munich there is a ten kilometres long retreat .
like an AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also came on the opposite way to massive disability - by numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade proved to have the characteristics of the vehicle @-@ gl@@ en@@ ker who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive sanctions .
shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
here it was a coll@@ ision between a car @-@ driver and a passenger cars .
a Res@@ cue @-@ Hel@@ ic@@ opter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced has : nothing is ar@@ ching sitting in the train and as@@ le@@ ep .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thoughts .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an uns@@ an@@ chor or t@@ ends the driver of the work@@ flow .
suspension lat@@ out .
but times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ et currently the righteous run@@ time control .
one confirms simply by mobile phone that you should be taken in place and de@@ valu@@ ations the ticket .
it is currently running a test operation on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , far we stretch it out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the rail@@ ways conversion without creativity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you need to use it , but need to meet certain requirements : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you have to also bought it via the app , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last one is necessary for a seat booking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works in the train , calling its map among &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the test customer then a button for the electronic score .
the Zug@@ companion will get on their mobile devices a message that the g@@ ast X is in the train and took the seating area Y .
comes the train station with the suspension lat@@ ched to square Y white he knows that there is a passenger with already de@@ valu@@ ed online ticket .
one can therefore continue to sleep , continue to keep on .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the rail@@ ways - which in turn requires the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to relax without a ticket control through our train , chec@@ ker in the DB Navigator software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will allow the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal development , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB tel@@ esc@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chapter Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives you , knows that besides bel@@ ong@@ ings and pas@@ ing trains the rides are among the biggest hass@@ les .
for many times , however , in any case , one of the ro@@ omm@@ end does not have all the documents that you need for the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the reference is missing or otherwise a document that you must set out .
the consequence of endless discussions between tension @-@ related and rides , resulting in a bad mood in the evenings or large spaces and delays in control of your own ticket and the Schaff@@ ner at the end takes time to take care of other matters .
still , only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just at the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further draw numbers on the same track are not activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist got to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
only one day after having arrived in New York City that sat in St. Louis on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat , which rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she was proud of a post by someone of the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it still is on the road , &quot; it says there .
b@@ aff@@ on since nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was about the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , killed live .
he post@@ ulates a picture of Brow@@ n@@ leb@@ ine &apos;s body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I kept Fer@@ rell at . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their fel@@ lowship .
she put her cell phone to a twe@@ et later in the evening on people at Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos from the police and people , the cri@@ bes , and by a man who contributed to his father who contributed a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
it observed a live @-@ feed , where a polic@@ eman got a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ ley dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , he said , a different polic@@ eman from his ri@@ f@@ le and cri@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of Fer@@ rell to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we used to have used and which we can make typical of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sh@@ aking fro@@ st .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 year old daughter from the house of her father , decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose stretching ? &quot; in the cin@@ emas starting from the 11th century .
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which is from the point of view of the people living in community and filled the streets to challenge answers .
when Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower gar@@ ment and a matching crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on drove the two a conversation , which she had countless times before this morning , &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember when I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; reminded them of what she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell soon .
&quot; what happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
she has to know and to see it and put it up .
she has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vis@@ m and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves .
even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally does not experience e@@ kl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women .
I feel I would prove her poor service to keep them away from them . &quot;
the first stop when they arrived at F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camping area , as the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ Prosec@@ ut@@ or of the portra@@ its .
there were Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner , who made lunch .
they made po@@ ckets before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new kind of acti@@ vis@@ m began to embrace with Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vis@@ m has totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that they were a student at the University of Miss@@ our@@ i @-@ St. Louis Presi@@ dents in the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted to only document it , what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document it or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ cism is nour@@ ished through countless cases of men , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ itted from their pain and its resistance to resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , their voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then member of the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his acti@@ vis@@ m around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt @-@ in@@ m@@ ates .
his involvement brought the project closer to the project along with six other locals followed by &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following browsers .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is on the movement &quot; not about a Messi@@ ah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the movie .
consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life , how she loves himself and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the conce@@ al@@ ment of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls has repeatedly called the role of the black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 , have influenced the film &quot; Black@@ me@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leaders have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must carry the main last of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an voted , to notice that &quot; the movement is kept true of black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it exists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen due to its identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence , even though she was at the front line , because with a life on these cru@@ ises , as a black , pregnant woman stands as much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the news cameras have long ago disappeared , but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is at currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway on a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area that it calls her home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
nevertheless they cl@@ oned to a song , and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose -- except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compare Siz@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV reader discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although it is still far from being built .
but the idea of a shopping center at the south @-@ end of the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct since the first presentation of 2009 people saw the population in supporters and opponents .
cold can barely be found on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one on the bit of the bit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) oder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sts ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compare w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Scholz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery will attract more customers in the city , of which the rest of the business will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct .
add to the gallery : the gallery is planned exactly on the property in which the farm hall stands , where 13 direct market @-@ mark@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of construction work it will be finished .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and indeed to Bed@@ a @-@ seat with possibility to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; we have been buying a week in the far@@ my@@ hall for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the crops always enjoy very much .
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after building the gallery there is an opportunity to keep this offer er@@ ect .
in other cities there is also this .
the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market @-@ mark@@ ers in a mark@@ eth@@ all in the gallery comes to the height of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; mar@@ qu@@ ettes in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ au@@ or or supermarket : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
you can see how many cargo stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since it is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that us at least remains the market hall .
because after all , the goods offered is fresh , mostly directly from the producers offered and is ob@@ end@@ purely inexpensive .
as you can see , shop transactions are located in a shopping centre only from larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , speci@@ aliz@@ ations are almost no longer and what still remains of it , will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a mark@@ eth@@ all fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit in Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farm@@ mark@@ ings during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery then actually comes .
or does it manage to distribute the tender bit of bit before , all transactions made from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and a shopping center that is empty , needs no one .
in my view it would have been better to promote a proper peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant hall there was thanks to the great many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore .
when the far@@ my@@ hall is broken , another piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ strange - hanging around the cables by the ceiling .
the 30 portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ cles , which you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former sec@@ rec@@ ess analy@@ st had been sentenced to 35 years imprisonment , after being considered secret diplomatic messages about the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming res@@ emb@@ lance ( an appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ vers@@ ine and landmark dis@@ assem@@ bling , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extrac@@ ted from Mann@@ ing , a sharp , if some intellectual comment does not only lead to the spatial ability of DNA data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already been talking about the identification as a woman , in 2013 was condemned for 20 accus@@ ations , including six bre@@ aches of the es@@ ying network , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison you have supp@@ ressed their image so much that there was only a single photo - a gr@@ itt , black @-@ white self @-@ head@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is obviously uncomfortable on a vehicle &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ in@@ bl@@ onde ti@@ lag@@ s - with which she was associated with .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of its 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
it produced the artist &apos;s portra@@ its of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette g@@ um and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um , extrac@@ ted the DNA from the drop in order to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper @-@ azin .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new show .
and she could not visit at this time and she was not photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked her if they wanted a DNA portrait .
the artist and their det@@ ain@@ ees M@@ use were re@@ ver@@ ted to un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ ec@@ onds which have several letters over the course of two years .
they called even one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ ped Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ly images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future in which the President Chel@@ ating Jud@@ gement would be transforming and it would be capable of seeing the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years were calling in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads to war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government , and against trans@@ gender equality to find new , hard drives , which he should really fix , continue to de@@ fl@@ ing .
when de@@ we@@ y @-@ hail from all these things were asked , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery described as a written artistic statement , Mann@@ ing , with its over@@ sized signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in its sur@@ name , is provided with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of C@@ s and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoff@@ te , represented by the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as ast@@ o@@ unding , at least in biological , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring will be that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is one side from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as they appear with a fre@@ igh@@ ts@@ ar@@ ef@@ on in the hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they talk your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , never to the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly out of a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gr@@ ail out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still don &apos;t want to watch , if I speak about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , of their own gen@@ om@@ ic sim@@ ulators , which unite like hor@@ des of protest .
that was also foc@@ uss@@ ed on how everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , which were written with a pencil on their genetic h@@ edge @-@ groups with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portra@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed together with Chelsea , like the movement , which is also hidden behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a habit of the University of Oxford for killing ,
a nation@@ wide human hunt is in progress for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which was chosen as susp@@ ects after a man has been put in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , for the Wyn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest warran@@ t was issued because of the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the ad@@ ress of the Cook Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several styles died .
a collabor@@ ative warning system by the police authorities have been reported that the bodies was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim to several injury to his body .
Corn@@ ell Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the place of action for dead , and det@@ ective the bul@@ ls as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ er , the Vice President of the University of University , said in an e @-@ mail statement , that La@@ them now be l@@ acked in evaluated and was excluded from the con@@ duction of the North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now an abstract matter which is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the authorities in every concei@@ vable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement imp@@ lied that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he meets the susp@@ ect to face the authorities .
&quot; the police have a concept of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi spoke , the police got a call from the building bai@@ li@@ ff of the Grand @-@ Plaza &apos;s building that had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is un@@ clear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the people : &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of mot@@ if@@ s including possible domestic occurrence . &quot;
&quot; we will close the W@@ ada &apos;s roadmap in the near future &quot; - Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian runner @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for restoration of Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ ADA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap R@@ US@@ ADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the W@@ ada &apos;s plan was updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM ann@@ ot@@ ted the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the code which describes the criteria for re@@ placing R@@ US@@ ADA and recently published on the website of the organisation .
according to Mut@@ ko , he contains nothing , what kind of Russia could cause concern .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria listed in the list described above , however , that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities must be reported the reported outcomes offered by the W@@ ada @-@ approved research of Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren state funded by the Russian sport in the Russian sport .

the start @-@ ups which will help your organization not to be over to the next u@@ ber
Amy Re@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the pol@@ ls are not working .
the answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - still worse - fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers do not let the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objecti@@ vity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t who operates the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the growth of helping companies to find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licens@@ ing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it allows companies to offer surveys , speci@@ als groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ n allow to deal with the C @-@ Suite ex@@ ecutives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure staff engagement .
salvation said that they have better insight into what your employees think and will feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to sn@@ ap surveys and pol@@ ls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that show at a glance which units have most gri@@ ev@@ ances and which ex@@ ecutives are low tuning results - so that you can indul@@ ge why .
companies come to view that at the top of the workplace culture , you will need to remain the next u@@ ber who has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since a former employee has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ as@@ sment , with those who have spoken , pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overall view of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and realise the poor behaviour and see an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the midst of the UFO flies in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
&quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent Company provides tailor @-@ made &quot; powder &quot; to collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report a bad behaviour .
and when the captain of the captain will be involved , dis@@ comforts goes directly to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ulators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that its staff is badly treated or dis@@ ethical , it can cost costly consequences due to consumers @-@ boy@@ cot@@ t , employees fluctu@@ ation and charges , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Conver@@ cent has been working for more than one year in order to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters .
sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem he had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said , there was no good opportunity to prosec@@ ute the complaints from employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent acts , problems , previously prepared by ex@@ ecutives , who were previously hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination , har@@ as@@ sment or im@@ pressing forces - quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree of view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group from Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment and law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to harvest ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the account@@ ability company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out due to ethical violations of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor the ethics , people used more hope than a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service provider , and load the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that supports joint venture capital investors which support both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conver@@ cent was granted $ 10 million in financing companies such as Sap@@ ph@@ ire vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital with which the whole capital was raised up to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gem@@ s secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his whole funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are barely surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is an increasing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more to be expected of their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just inser@@ ts .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company that their voices heard , and that the work you do is worth , then she feels more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Linked@@ In , which is used both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors will gain return if their portfolio companies are well run . companies work well if employees are committed and engaged .
if the Analytics tools of third promises to increase commitment and commitment to the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data about the staff &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , when an enterprise asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not coming quickly enough , or not at all , this dis@@ regards dis@@ appointments and employees .
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must have prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies to very much rely on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not followed by staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
take care of it ?
and who do not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who has now passed monthly staff members , was able to take action on the same day if an issue about G@@ lin@@ t reports , so salvation .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees it was due to the speed of making the decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company gets always new insights on employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better li@@ aison of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the break @-@ ins
it is going on 23 o &apos;clock that a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers based on one side of the new exercise areas of the team at the campus .
some have moved out of their tri@@ cot@@ he@@ als and show the back full of swe@@ at from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team the disabled minutes represent a mid@@ day break .
players who are written to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final exam@@ inations , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 at the water man football center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually prolonged their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 , in order to meet the already complete tim@@ eke@@ eping time of the player .
the compromise away from the two days is more than one day , where the break at the beginning of the camp was postpon@@ ed for the first time during the summer period and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during the summer school .
they should ab@@ ide in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 years before the formal games preparations for their pre@@ l@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the control of the N@@ CA@@ A , even when she added the busy routes of the players to add another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it down , they are plac@@ eable , they are great people .
I think once we arrive until Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , indic@@ ating the clear line of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale ships , which is already assigned with pedestri@@ ans , which is already being an easy task .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a sp@@ ire that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched from thinking that people also rent a room and then adjust it to an exercise .
if you have vide@@ ob@@ and of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking place 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I don &apos;t worry about that too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential article associated with fal@@ s@@ ings to the fact sheet pro@@ aud@@ itor of third parties and display their findings under the original contribution then the world &apos;s largest Online @-@ Social Network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake @-@ news .
the company said in an opinion on his website that will begin with the use of updated machinery learning methods to recognize possible mis@@ mel@@ ting and to send them to the fact @-@ checked that may display results of the fact test in the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has become a major political issue in Europe , whereby French voters have been flood@@ ed in advance of the presidential elections in May with wrong stories , and Germany will support a plan to pun@@ ished the social media networks as they did not succeed , h@@ iring post@@ ings as before the elections in September quickly .
on Thursday , Facebook in a separate declaration presented in German , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review .
&quot; in addition to finding what stories of fact aud@@ ited third parties are challenged , people want more context to make sound @-@ made decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Produc@@ er &apos;s for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associated article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his messages Fe@@ ed to decrease false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic Romans : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past the small Scot@@ ney Castle was shown in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 @-@ er years a si@@ p@@ ole .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years tum@@ ul@@ ent history of its comfortable seat in Be@@ w@@ l river valley in K@@ ent and is now a inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ gen Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says w@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos;s sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who illustrated in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , coming British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ a@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;@@ dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he expects unexpected emoti@@ onally .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ pressure on the side of a letter so re@@ acted by a double ag@@ enten in the 1700 &apos;s years ago , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; says .
&quot; this is his thum@@ b @-@ pressure !
and he always cra@@ w@@ l to smoke ; for that time , we ign@@ ed a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself alone .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who lived so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; To be honest : I forgot my welcome , &quot; ) it seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ d spent his days exploring the Vietnamese &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena @-@ heads at the walls and the bottles that centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he hi@@ ked through the land and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ owners , gar@@ dener and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only in 2006 the full access , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
as Rhodes a decade later , the employee started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , &quot; drive it on the attic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tag@@ eb@@ ücher , letters from the time of English Em@@ pi@@ res , cards which represent what poss@@ essed : &quot; you might think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go out of course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to write on bre@@ iter@@ er base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which is a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farmer &apos;s rise of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of a mo@@ ver that appeared 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; the farm arose in this area and I thought that an insur@@ rection was a good start .
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of Jes@@ uit &apos; , the family of Dar@@ rell hid during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell was represented in the 18th century by filled out a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes @-@ favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men seemed quite fast cro@@ oks to be increasing and to spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men ext@@ ingu@@ ished their school trains , by married rich old women - I introduce it to me as a bunch of good guys , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ nen . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences .
he has had a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness , for a com@@ ic @-@ novel about El@@ vi@@ y@@ be@@ mä@@ ki , behind him , the complex of a san@@ atori@@ ums from the early 20th century , which has since then returned from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the van@@ ity of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf started the town of Bad Honnef on Friday to launch a new roof stamp ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
and until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the slogan of the slogan .
at the end of August there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the creators of the promotion since yesterday on the post@@ ers at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; we think that ( obviously ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their yesterday un@@ locked web page .
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we strongly believe that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attr@@ acti@@ veness of our city very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the action it &apos;s going to be more than &quot; just a logo and a slogan , it is called on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ pointed promise , one that the city gives an un@@ mistak@@ able moment of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the town of Bad Honnef can be calculated for their new umbrella and campaign .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year in early August he advis@@ es in Ankara the Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ers and carrier in the officer &apos; officer .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish dispute forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was not held in the General Assembly , as formerly , but in the office of the prime minister .
in the couns@@ ell@@ ors , under the presidency of the Heads of Government , the five Vice @-@ president , as well as the ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Aus@@ wär@@ tiges Amt .
the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the transition .
the government moves the race to the military in the military .
general stab@@ ef Hul@@ usi Ak@@ ko remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y have been de@@ pl@@ eted .
since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erd@@ og@@ an approved the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of its alle@@ ged connections to the movement of exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire drawing of the put@@ sch .
against 4@@ 86 people who were immediately involved in the coup attempt , he is negotiating Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup Erd@@ og@@ an had been referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God hin@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to fully clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an has really got a handle on the army ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general rule there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , manifest@@ ing itself among others in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Groß@@ e@@ em@@ ans in the Army and the security staff goes any way further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid July Erd@@ og@@ an per decre@@ e further 73@@ 95 cou@@ ri@@ ans , including 23@@ 03 police officers and 54@@ 6 soldiers .
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an seemed t@@ amed to the military .
the gener@@ als run earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times pl@@ aster them under appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world state order .
after his election victory , Erd@@ og@@ an urged Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s power to take step back , not least among appeal to the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers , Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ rei@@ be targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; was a well @-@ called non @-@ called officer , who sought after the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extrem@@ ists and Sal@@ af@@ ists in just a few years . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not be N@@ ato .
anyway , in the alliance , there is doubts about the inf@@ ants in the emergency prepar@@ atory of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quot@@ ed by the media .
he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 5@@ 0,000 a year , str@@ ingent regulations for issu@@ ing visa for a temporary employment permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this bill will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way the citizens from other countries where Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who will have the financial means to support yourself and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quot@@ ed by the American media .
Ministry wants to re@@ sign the circuit for Renn@@ ingen
over the past few months the future of the race turned out was disp@@ uted - now it should be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the short distance is scheduled , on which the tourist train goes , will be built .
in order to guarantee the future of the race in the long term , according to the Department of the Ministry of Commerce this year , we shall begin to work on the track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g further to order and kid@@ neys , he knows the country to this mainly for tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated road secret@@ ary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the commission@@ ing of the course is approximately 2.5 million euros .
from this amount assumed the country 75 percent .
the contract , on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , I am going to be final .
the Ministry and the South@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as the operator can agree on the technical details already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the timetable that used vehicles and the quality standards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ shuttle will be ordered at the end of December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a particularly popular among the tourists popular railway connection between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot company , the route was tested by plenty of people to order them again in the future .
the circuit is also very thick in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t be any crazy about 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actual .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the ey@@ ec@@ color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny , but the company delivering plenty of it and we will see her more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern Sex@@ t@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ics with a sili@@ cone skin , which feels warm and with deliber@@ ately human reactions that are achieved by the artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to their beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the form of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his fingers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it will be more wor@@ rying because many robots had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would be a step@@ ping @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern Sex@@ t@@ olls have developed to robots with a sili@@ cone .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot can provide it for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that appe@@ aling it , such as sp@@ ic@@ is@@ ness .
and then there is the True Compan@@ ion golden Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programm@@ ed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ ame@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wendy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ med the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so may they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you do not like , etc .
during the day she has had its m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it may be tired to be fixed on conversation or she may be &quot; in &quot; &quot; mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many troub@@ ling aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the differ@@ ing female properties , the contra@@ sts on rape , if one gets a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : re@@ pres@@ cri@@ bing ) Far@@ rah , be@@ aten a most .
on his website true True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a VI@@ BRA@@ TOR why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however these sex robots are not only an fet@@ ish or just just a different sex vehicle .
their formation and their increasing refin@@ ement indicate a bit dar@@ ker and deeper within our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition .
most men will of course prevent no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R have noted its rising popularity , it still remains temporary on the edge of Consumer Culture .
but what has w@@ oven out of the edge @-@ zones , can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until them the free market gives permission .
however , there is a certain number of means that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where the rights of women are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has v@@ owed to have women sexually attacked .
the most aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the dev@@ out bodies and the sto@@ cked eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robot is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their buil@@ ders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the motion of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; figures &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing , which indicates the independence or anything that could b@@ other the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , you are sil@@ ly slaves .

tr@@ umps large performance ?
he turns Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the term of healthy human mind
it has become a bin@@ ders of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ ari@@ zed the U.S. elec@@ tor@@ ate , even have split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and harvest feast , there were some advice in the US newspaper with advice about how to deal with the hor@@ ror of d@@ ump relative .
we all supp@@ os@@ edly throw ourselves to burst our filter bu@@ bb@@ les .
less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps , families to come together .
I mention this because my c@@ ous@@ ins , a linear poet , which lives in Chicago and has long been busy with rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , who visited this week in New York .
they reminded me that the unit against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , struggling for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite pecu@@ liar on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks .
the left was in@@ vigor@@ ated by Tr@@ ump , but the de@@ stell@@ ing effect of his presidency did the force to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tick , we refer to the gr@@ ati@@ fying way that a day could no longer be ab@@ id@@ ated by one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a still horri@@ ble @-@ time scenario , in the Tr@@ ump rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alised &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
I find myself today of an active nost@@ algia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ gency involved - the dog on the au@@ d@@ ach who saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both tend to happen as a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump is going to be the next can@@ did@@ acy of Republi@@ can only be mentally healthy to qualify as in@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ous@@ ins was in town , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ri@@ al of New York car parks , and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if no caffeine is needed .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all cl@@ owns and the animals per@@ rot@@ ate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ om and the sound @-@ changing music gives this in a notable way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day than I found that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big rot@@ ary in the north of London .
the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , as here two two year old , a 11 year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ five years can go on it , and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to rate the kar@@ us@@ sell , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , in this week I was comp@@ elled to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before being able to go through my credit card .
in the Coffee @-@ House on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to get the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping the same - this to buy something over the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ting pressure on the server in order to interv@@ ene in a situation where no need is required .
the poor wife in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ zing , while I &apos;m tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us who moved to hospital in prison

as a symbol for granted , the 29 students of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schum@@ acher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eagle , which is growing in the chicken , but then the freedom is dischar@@ ged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this led the m@@ our@@ e Sch@@ ar a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Ch@@ icken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ ods from its chicken .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .

the young was different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , belonging to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wanted to wish every four @-@ win@@ egro@@ wer that he feels at his new school .
it followed by Dan@@ kes@@ face to the colleagues of the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who again jumps again with classes of lessons , and the parents representatives .

software update for diesel cars : what those affected are needed
how accurate does the software update take place ?
will the diesel driver take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel Summit , BMW , Opel and the VW Group software are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
it is intended to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from cars of emissions Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the trad@@ ed software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compul@@ sory updates previously applies only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ mel@@ software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their retro@@ fit has formally ordered the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Power @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the makers have announced an effective implementation in the next few months , but not yet another date .
Daimler has indicated , to write every person concerned .
if a inspection is sus@@ pen@@ sive , that will be done within the framework .
how long are the retro@@ fitting out of a total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ ana .
the relationship depends on the commitment of the producers and from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we have seen , we voluntarily act the auto @-@ producer on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will this update last ?
the retro@@ fitting themselves could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be it to make an appointment .
what are motor@@ ists who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is waiting for wast@@ ing .
probably foreign manufacturers would attract , so S@@ met@@ ana .
are now facing a massive prize di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea from Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but even in the regions where driving can thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there is so far no imp@@ air@@ ment for older diesel .
the ACE is waiting for a sale still to be seen .

we do the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , continues in R@@ ente next year .
the passage is already written - suitable applic@@ ants are r@@ ar .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he con@@ veys on the press .
he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for its successor .
at the same time , he wonder@@ ed that far no application will fulfil the requirements specification .
the city is looking for an architect or a construction engineer at the next time .
thus , in compliance with the regular notice dead@@ lines - there will be enough time for a drawing up .
da Has@@ lach for the Board of Directors as a sub @-@ rights law acts , the applic@@ ant must show appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city on any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill them out , the citizens would have to go to advice through Off@@ enburg .
but closer to the city and itself is important , W@@ acker says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , several major projects have accum@@ ulated at the W@@ acker &apos;s pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the town worth living , he is sure about the building and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ als and of the Lower @-@ car@@ park area around are .
the city @-@ bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium rehabilitation is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only the latter will strike with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates wh@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything in all waiting great tasks on my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
altern@@ ately , for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great play room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own private building and gar@@ dener could react to many quite flexible .
&quot; you can move much , &quot; as W@@ acker , and the design of its green zones is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
because the old city stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what it should fit , &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ised Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility .
he is a client , &quot; in the end everything goes here over my table . &quot;
for assistance and coordination he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working with Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor is long , W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really want to identify and stay in place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good company , but also for the further development of the city .
who wants to be@@ g Roland W@@ acker , should be advised for information from the city of Has@@ lach a completed graduate as a Dipl@@ omin@@ genie@@ ur or Bachelor with Fach@@ richtung Archit@@ ects and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction phases .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt under@@ stand high @-@ quality and low @-@ construction , construction @-@ areas , administration of urban property @-@ ships , urban operation house with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei , as well as a sub @-@ rights law , including monument protection .
bike on lines cast : from the central track locked
according to the police , the famous perpet@@ r@@ ator had accused the blue cycling distance from the railway line in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were so strongly damaged , that the her@@ on freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and are looking for the night lessons .
a bike @-@ sco@@ oter and a bike riders were observed by witnesses of the Tat@@ ort .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ .@@ ich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch for APA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or the perpet@@ rators have brought itself in great danger and also thre@@ aten the migration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides the damage to the L@@ ok and the plant , as well as the delays and costs for rail transport , nor can add passenger clients to the perpet@@ rators .
altogether , be out of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; the spokes@@ man said .
the damages were early on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south side @-@ track could be guided with no disability .
almost ten personal vessels were early Friday afternoon , two of them regard the remote traffic .
freight trains were not falling out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 meters above .
the insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( Infl@@ amed Dar@@ mer@@ ung ) to lin@@ dern
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digest@@ ive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study confirms exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients could alle@@ vi@@ ate with inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases .
the incur@@ able condition that affects the USA around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causing stomach cr@@ amps and bl@@ ender , recur@@ rent or bloody di@@ arr@@ ings , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during the suffer@@ ers usually come , meat and dairy products meet to relie@@ ve their symptoms , found researchers at the Washingtoner Universität gaining that the essential amino acid tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an increased from proteins to develop immune cells that develop a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that dam@@ aging micro @-@ bs who hide themselves in the food not to penet@@ rate into the body .
cells , the im@@ itable , infections , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without being ash@@ amed tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result from anti @-@ inflammat@@ ory diseases .
in experiments were determined that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice , which carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in its obj@@ ectors .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an - one of the stones of proteins - to wi@@ pe the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have made a connection between a bacter@@ ium art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - who is a normal part of the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ ane @-@ rich nutrition will be toler@@ ated , less anti @-@ inflammat@@ ory intest@@ inal intest@@ ine stim@@ ulated , if the same system is wir@@ ing with people .
the post@@ doc@@ toral officer in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ went a sort of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study partners had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but who had not been separated .
they suspected that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal tract .
the har@@ ms of mice were cut DNA sequ@@ entially and there were six species of bacterial infections , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them inf@@ alli@@ ed with mice .
mice were re@@ ared in a ster@@ ile environment so that they l@@ acked a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they were not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a fluid and then resulted in small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells , which were isolated by the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
as the active component of the liquid was puri@@ fied , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an metabol@@ ites that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an@@ gible were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells such as mice and that most of us see L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intest@@ inal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an accessory products made of L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in people such as mice but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ an were found in people with inflammat@@ ory Dar@@ mer@@ diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ ypto@@ ph@@ ane values in the presence of L. rep@@ ent@@ i can lead to an increase of this population . &quot;

new pre@@ cip@@ itation for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind had yet bo@@ died : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still SPD @-@ chief , S &amp; D Prime Minister , Prime Minister @-@ Democratic Prime Minister before elections were always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
merely no stor@@ ero@@ fire from the party central , merely no consensus from the covenant - so loud the most important desire of the election war .
since Martin Schulz , the party has changed , it has changed tremend@@ ously .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus , observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed national capitals .
what Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year , the head@@ wind would not be described in the approach .
there were deep @-@ fail@@ ures .
and indeed one by one .
after the start@@ ling end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal government sees a general signal against the Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and the Green Party .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green cannot simply be reli@@ ably governed , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising f@@ acti@@ onal leader of a Green party has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the pre @-@ day election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its red @-@ green coalition to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens @-@ federal enterprise leader Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the Ab@@ tr@@ ün@@ n@@ ty @-@ Sax@@ on parliamentary Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to give its mandate back .
the re@@ sig@@ nation to the CD@@ U means a clear delay of the voting .
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately give her mandate &quot; said the federal leader and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must all be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ted an SPD @-@ election , when on Friday morning the new Hi@@ obs@@ cur@@ ity passed the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister from Nieder@@ sachsen , stands for the remains of the green MPs El@@ ke T@@ westen on the CD@@ U without its own ruling majority .
it is the pro@@ visional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ cher started off with the un@@ fores@@ een defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no longer so@@ othing the comrades of the comrades .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia will be everything different .
this then became apparent - and it all became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into Tau@@ m@@ eln , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the party so smoothly .
the comrades had caught up again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just had the courage , the G @-@ 20 @-@ summit of Hamburg came from Hamburg .
and with it the next gra@@ b attack came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Scholz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ sk@@ ef , on this weekend , he lost his Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while he burned his city .
and because he added that in the crisis communication , it was pretty much wrong after that which one can do wrong .
since then , he has been fighting for his political survival .
now even Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ abor@@ tive and his role in the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has already been in criticism for longer .
Mi@@ ese Ab@@ question@@ e@@ values came along .
nevertheless , or maybe right therefore , W@@ eil has always tried to get stronger in the federal government in the past weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hannover to develop his power in Berlin , and in the midst of Martin Schulz continued to be hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him give him because they spoke out a stabil@@ isation of the party from we@@ dge .
well the exact opposite could occur .
on this , we@@ dge meets the im@@ part@@ isan tw@@ ist of the Bundestag in essence not fault .
and Schulz currently not at all .
at times the comrades take the right to hold their own ranks .
her anger is up to the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly on the female parliament@@ arians in T@@ west .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democr@@ acies over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the publisher network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms T@@ westen is not elected as director of her person as direct kan@@ ers , but also on the country list of the Dutch Green party , so the decl@@ ining member will continue .
the logical consequence would it be that she returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Head of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ain@@ ted a &quot; more democratic man@@ o@@ eu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ tor@@ ate four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan W@@ eil as Prime Minister President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who introduces the Lower SPD as a nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the German Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career of a future CD@@ U members &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ordered to clarify the backgrounds .
I will know if there has been more or there was ongoing commitment to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
Förder@@ gel@@ der for Ort@@ is@@ ern III
who wants to get out into the years to get a house , can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of Ste@@ g &apos;s development was received on Wednesday in received .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler was once again a glimp@@ se onto the present day .
since 1991 there has been in ou@@ ded view@@ areas .
at the time , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg have taken over two thirds of the total assets .
in the refurb@@ ishment phase II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy still stood at 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to foster inter@@ development and not only ex@@ clude new construction areas .
on 4 April , by the government of the government , Karlsruhe also received the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the convey@@ or sum of 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which cas@@ ed 500 000 Euros of the country , the rest of the municipality received .
how is now a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate as sh@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area ever interest to rolling .
in addition , the territory could then also post@@ p@@ one again .
the Ste@@ g represented on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
the cellar presented the contents of the Bund @-@ federal programme &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt , &quot; as part of which the re@@ group@@ ings would then be carried out .
the core of the program is the rev@@ itali@@ zation of inner cities , improving living / living conditions and to preserve and expand infrastructure .
the measures would be subject @-@ related , that is done per plot .
the refurb@@ ishment was then determined as a stat@@ ute .
the delivery period for the funding period runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year it would not once again be carried out the survey , within the framework of which the participants were able to fill out a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December the stat@@ utes should be assigned to the Stat@@ utes , so that in the coming year will begin with the divisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that any Comm@@ une will carry out the ag@@ gre@@ ed investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about to evaluate the urban du@@ ti@@ ers and decide when rolling is and to what extent .
for the respective ground there will also be a re@@ arrangement in the basic book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come again and have a picture of the situation , he spoke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be quest@@ ionn@@ aires which will be sent to the people in the coming weeks and will be filled up by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow camera is the &quot; building and property bow , &quot; with which among other things is concerned with the construc@@ tional state and the refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and motor@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made in size , distribution and residents of a residential area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; business bow &quot; can only be completed , if in building business rooms are operated .
however , to note , de@@ zel pointed out that a filled step is not at the same time a motion for funding .
furthermore , new measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler empha@@ sized that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; wind and gre@@ ening &quot; super@@ ti@@ oni@@ ere - who first comes , war@@ med first .
you can not book any sponsors for later . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conclusion , pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Advert@@ ising cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the decision of the White House , a nav@@ el helic@@ opter to fly to South La@@ wn for an event covering the American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers costs up according to the particulars of the military that have been left to the TIME magazine until 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is abo@@ ard was the heart of the event on July 17th at the White House with American design programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and leading officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helic@@ opter helic@@ opter was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft of Mississippi .
the military office of the White House required the presence of helic@@ op@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helic@@ opter trip to the South La@@ wn , following the records of Marine Hel@@ ic@@ opter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helic@@ opter .
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the com@@ mander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the altern@@ ate Marin@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation .
the news showed that the helic@@ opter arrived on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long stayed until the lawn was cle@@ ared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be del@@ ayed , due to the restriction of the services you would need a second team for the return flight .
the original flight number was during the helic@@ opter event , while the safety gu@@ ardian of the unit remained on the ground at the plane .
from the notes made available to the notes were not clear whether the second flight is required .
the H@@ atch Act ver@@ offers federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records data show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event does not viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one issue that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the com@@ mander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sound as if you are locked &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the dep@@ uty com@@ mander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events have political over@@ tones .
on the event , the President gave a cl@@ ash to the reform of the health reform reform in the Senate and he pro@@ pag@@ ated the efforts to susp@@ ect the government &apos;s instructions .
the use of the airplane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for political benefit is barely a new phenomenon .
Presi@@ dents are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is un@@ common .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February than that of its first Kamp@@ agn@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of announ@@ cements that can be used by its predec@@ essors through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states shows , made by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the dep@@ uty press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
h@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws are often carrying workouts in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn in order to deal with the U.S. President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House was done 58 exercises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event attracted over the training requirement for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helic@@ opter units , in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ president support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers had no burden on any of the other pro@@ ps that were introduced at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said the company had not been involved in putting the helic@@ opter in the South La@@ wn .
however , H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop budget@@ ary instructions for the presidential system , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ arians of the Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund is approved for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight lesson .
records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the hom@@ eb@@ ase of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ anti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helic@@ opter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for tax@@ pay@@ ers defined on the basis of the estimates for re@@ funds , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden cost which are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a Rand study from the year 2015 , the funding rates for Do@@ D does not include human resource costs , but consider the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time the former secret@@ ary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helic@@ opter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , even if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helic@@ opter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to empha@@ size this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helic@@ opter hosted , when he entered his circuit through the South La@@ wn in the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and slept with the media about its own fleet of dairy products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow starting at 11 am in Kiel with the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ re Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV on .
despite its five games still imm@@ ac@@ ulate the balance of the second tennis Bundes@@ liga has obtained the sense of reality .
Team@@ leaders Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays a similarly similar formation .
right on the rear position I find the team very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV , all the imports from the high north .
&quot; their plans and fin@@ s can even refer to ins@@ ets in the Davis Cup .
and they are also greatly in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ova@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Peder@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ us@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this is how difficult for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then you need a good fortune of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ uss team for the Trip to the high north is useful .
its debut for blue @-@ white could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he finished Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ ro@@ me his signature under the law to scr@@ apping the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his m@@ ast , the law to dro@@ ple@@ t , &quot; I packed the Congress a few &quot; constitutional requirements . &quot;
also the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels dre@@ amed against the U.S. pipe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the design is fores@@ een to pun@@ ish European businesses that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since that time , investors are concerned with the domestic O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed with other European firms to the construction of the Russian Baltic region Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is extensive .
nevertheless it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official Statement of the oil painting .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should not have to resur@@ rect the sanctions once an executive order .
twelve weapons are at your disposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at the top of the Group and which could really w@@ ander to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , Pablo Es@@ co@@ dbar K@@ iller is unveil@@ ed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from being over .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by Stream@@ ing Service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bö@@ se@@ wi@@ ped of the Show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of the drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate , &quot; as a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 company , &quot; only with more state bri@@ ber@@ ies and violent actions .
G@@ IL@@ BER@@ TO Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the map , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) and ch@@ epe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal is converted to Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silvest@@ re , Ker@@ ry Bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on 1 September .
roll back@@ wards : the city places 46 cu@@ ch@@ ants .
the city organiz@@ es the cas@@ ita lunch for itself .
with strong points of contact for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban nur@@ sery , the clock will be trac@@ ed .
to the 1st of September the city Kre@@ feld will take over the travel supply in the urban nur@@ sery &apos;s facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance , dep@@ uty leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; we all have been very happy . &quot;
bo@@ iled remains except for house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh water cooling .
the city operates in the fields of field 46 day@@ centre workshops , in 44 we get the children for mid@@ day , a hot meal .
last Kit@@ aj@@ ahr each sat with 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 hours of hours are taken care of , in the cas@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support when kids stay up to 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial forces , starting September 1 , Kitchen service : you warm the s@@ laugh@@ tered food , complement them around salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean off , rin@@ se the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a KING , &quot; says P@@ omm@@ ance .
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group@@ ed institutions - decide about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchens are now firmly committed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says M@@ omm@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the kitesur@@ fing experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and culinary lessons .
&quot; the children shall help to prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the ch@@ enk@@ pun@@ ished team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well known force in the k@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the mamm@@ als of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the exercise of the kitchen staff - will be done in future by special cleaning agents .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it turned out for the price comparison between self @-@ regulated and foreign award for the city as the most economical , it is out of the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces are newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours drop out at around 750 people in the educational area not so strongly in weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sonja P@@ omm@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ MB Scotland said , the company informed about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which makes next to other products ho@@ bs and gro@@ ve Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he spent more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that workers and trade unions were &quot; perceived as the first &quot; if their activities would change .
in a letter to the stores of the company called for G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express my concerns that the funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines are not driven forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can not gain clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members deeply concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentrate strongly on the local community and the large @-@ room Glas@@ go@@ w , a key pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , of the Loh@@ ns and of We@@ alth , and against the background of Bre@@ xit the rising of life costs and of chronic production slow@@ down , the eastern end of glass go@@ w urgently des@@ per@@ ing a thri@@ ving production of Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; the Fili@@ ph@@ us at T@@ oll@@ cross has only awarded a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly to this since we appreciate the continued commitment in staff and trade union representatives .
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies , who are in an extremely competitive and un@@ certain economic crisis , our business are constantly checked and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site , fully in place . should change our operations on the site , the employees and their trade @-@ union representatives will be the first to know this . &quot;
did the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago in N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the La League site likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to avoid the pi@@ vot@@ al pi@@ al , but do they have war@@ ded to Barcelona three years before the world attack ?
the sens@@ ational approach has hal@@ ted the transit window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record to break over the double the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba had returned to Manchester United States in the past season to Manchester United .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar is the most expensive player in the world and for the most @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PSG provides sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has imposed its way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans sur@@ rection he has given that the club has always given his best to care for him since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but the football world was warned three years ago by the PSG President against this prospect .
when Manchester City 2014 has expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi had a strict warning for every club , who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all the clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to have one of our players at their sign , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have passed this line , while the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG made clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by giving one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( report dep@@ rec@@ ated Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report about the mis@@ use cases ent@@ ailed Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the Miss@@ ing sc@@ andal with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is continuing to discussions .
Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated to publication from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as of the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the Emer@@ itus Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . , an exc@@ use .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would deep@@ en their deep regret on his own om@@ issions or their at that time false evaluation of operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ servat@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , on the other hand , critic@@ ized that in the reporting of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; speaking with regard to the remains in Regensburg nobody knows that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus the author &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of Italian bio @-@ ethics committees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday life experience and preparing public opinion that is normal to keep it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also prin@@ c@@ ess of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you would like to go to the church and that is an un@@ inhabited fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lows a very ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be done with bad children , how I was one , ready to finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to use today &apos;s standards for past decades as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse sei@@ zu@@ res often the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger on show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says author and histori@@ an Michael Hes@@ emann , who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in shelter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is shown in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ed attorney Ulrich Weber filed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 54@@ 7 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who has been working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; summary , so that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases were used physical and psychological violence .
particularly in high levels of emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be disast@@ rous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accused , that many victims inf@@ ants the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even connect positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann , despite the final report to the Miss@@ our@@ al sc@@ andal in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger his point of view .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report about the &quot; Pre@@ ferences of Non@@ violence &quot; to the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a conf@@ lic@@ ting image of Dom@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a great many students show up his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became tangible . in case a domain of musical has no top performance .
how do you consider his bi@@ graph this query report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when referring to the effort and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to look rather , why the name George R@@ atz@@ inger is not found at all .
they are dedicated exclusively to eight sites and he will clearly be acqu@@ itted from any suspic@@ ion of any means or co @-@ being among the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the non@@ violence in the pre @-@ school ex@@ propri@@ ate themselves outside its sphere of sphere .
you can throw at all , if you know too late or not take the first hint of not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; das Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ cher@@ asi@@ um , on which he said , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and Bon@@ b@@ ons , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always cle@@ ared from the grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ aining about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high levels of emoti@@ on@@ ality which has also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ er@@ brü@@ chen .
that he did not only b@@ apti@@ zed with chairs and bow@@ ed down the keys , but also ear@@ headed guys to the hair or ears , he himself gave himself to her , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , at his honour deli@@ ver@@ ance , however , must be said that such educ@@ ators were widespread in the frag@@ ile period , the 1960s and 19@@ 70s , widespread in parents like with teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
again , I have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state @-@ Gymnasium .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the non @-@ violence on the pre @-@ school , are the detached d@@ Bag@@ at@@ elles .
then you wonder if it is not with his famili@@ arity and his role as the brother of Benedi@@ kt X@@ VI@@ . to do that many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
at the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him still , still eag@@ er@@ ly down .
the truth but is : the report reli@@ eved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media was related to the report a lot about the abuse of abuse with the regime &apos;s regime .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also applies to any processing or co @-@ kno@@ b in terms of sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual band@@ ages claims to have become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were sanc@@ ti@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never aw@@ ed to talk with my father or mother in that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a subject of suffer@@ ers for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in illumin@@ ating sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are sil@@ enced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they don &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us who would have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do the Scr@@ ab@@ ble students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a survey student formed this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he had been troub@@ led ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely knowledge and could have been able to have the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really absurd , to accept that even him ... Bub@@ bles intru@@ der or more clear or rather opened , than toward their parents , dormit@@ ory conduc@@ tors , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in advance , students and / or their environment trusted in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what affects sexual abuse is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thus release from every co @-@ knowing .
thus , it cannot be thre@@ w , nor can it be prevented or brought to the display .
thus , there is also no reason to associate his good name with these contradic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to read in the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is taken out of the report .
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem , that in the coverage everything mixed and ver@@ ified to a huge melan@@ chol@@ y from sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere , in the midst of the Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely again a mis@@ use of the report .
there is namely , namely , between the pre @-@ school and the gramm@@ ar School of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence , as well as say we say other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report coinci@@ des from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ ago@@ gi@@ k , the cases in which Kn@@ aben from seasonal teachers have been pun@@ ched and nar@@ row@@ ed and including de@@ grading , ex@@ propri@@ ated themselves at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ and@@ al@@ ous states have to be ruled out .
but with those who had the cap@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger nothing to do because he got the boy only to face when she had already been in the room scr@@ at@@ ched .
on this one , as most witnesses raised , the theme of the pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
one was only happy to be escap@@ ed and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even heavenly &quot; states .
what was the other way to the domain thr@@ ust ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there has been a discipline , but there was no sa@@ wing violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases despite violence even connect positive memories with him . &quot;
so at most still the accus@@ ation , away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish herself and was not responsible for the processes at a school at which he didn &apos;t work and was responsible ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again since 1993 .
provided Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the boards consistently the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ et@@ ric system that even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out that the exam@@ inees continue to be performed in the pre@@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative pres@@ ets , he recommended ur@@ ther penet@@ rating .
it was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , when a test @-@ criminal has long been prohibited in Bavaria .
before , they ex@@ propri@@ ate themselves in a legal grey area , as each of us probably still knows .
it was difficult for him to cher@@ ish him , where the people were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted border had been exceeded .
but one can also not say he would always be away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the aud@@ ition of schools were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
princip@@ ality in Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Taxis said yes , it is unfair to use today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards on the dam@@ aging time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ out of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; says the danger , the Past to assess this moral place .
the prin@@ c@@ ess has quite right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre@@ school to ad@@ versity and violence against un@@ ne@@ al children &apos;s ri@@ mp@@ s , which already goes far beyond that time .
it is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally going on .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , because all that had nothing to do with him .
its means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ ing and moving to the hair and ears , were widely used in the 19@@ 70s .
when bodily punishment are then banned , he also has strictly out@@ law@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the picture of his Reg@@ ens@@ burger Zeit has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the topic of exam@@ inees to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : now , in the book we are talking about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen also played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t see at all that he reg@@ iment a strict reg@@ iment .
but that must once said once said , without such a perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the em@@ powerment un@@ qualified discipline , wouldn &apos;t have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural amb@@ assador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you do not even make a great singer and stand before every success , just in which area , still discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming themselves .
as for a person , because George R@@ atz@@ inger has experienced in discussions with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : by working on the book and in addition I have seen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well acquainted and repeatedly experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , land@@ gr@@ acious , deep unbeliev@@ ing and heart@@ ed people from which one could not imagine doing something for them .
I arrive regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is still today , 23 years after its Emer@@ it@@ ance , regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of their family .
those not for@@ given to him today that he was once in strict with them , so are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ licher teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly that may be - but also a lov@@ able respec@@ table child , to which they still look up and die it flat@@ ly .
and please , again quite clear : everything that we pre@@ aching to him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day .
we can be glad we have overcome this time for a long time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he has promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother , to make the medi@@ al s@@ cap@@ ego@@ ats .
there is the evil intention that behind it , only too obvious .
because the report , which was just released , reli@@ eved him .
now the stand @-@ areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . finally , finally in peace .
