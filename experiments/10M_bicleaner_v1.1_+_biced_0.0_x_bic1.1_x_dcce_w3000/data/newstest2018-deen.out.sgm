<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people are to face today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A Gruftkapelle, where now for the S-Bahn tunnel is buried.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-gardener gives the most common cause of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich fosters exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to take a thrilling time, because the auto-Navi instead had a green meadow instead of a envelope.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of Geoportals in the state government, are anything but current - yet very short-breaking.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a Flickr eppich, which one cannot realize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the vast surplus-postcard for cities and villages were detailed, so-called Urposition-sheets, incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to data from the Bayerisches Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864, and originate from the first survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leaders took part in Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War, with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country, and gave a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops reached the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbor that created the idea of a region-covered Bayern-Card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project further, founded the "topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bayerische Staatsballungsverwaltung.</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like to find all the other on the website of the Bayerisches Land.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of fruits / Gestern, the provincial capital, is the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subset, that appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as Münchner district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, submerling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses subtypes focus on 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after 1878 Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the west-park is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when Hinduoomen appears a small-piece map with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten numbered Flurpieces from the so-called "Urs" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small pitches are evidence there today neither farmers left - but small gardener of the complex" "" "Land in Sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is drawn north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 showroom of the October Revolution, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the jungle leaflet one reads in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "at Gasteig. or from the heigth" On the ventilation "- but also in large letters" Irren institutions. "</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse one wiped once people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lüke" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard ruled by Gudden, the establishment - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the Ankle of the so-called Irish.</seg>
<seg id="36">He is also allowed to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged in an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first place, later was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime, this capacity is no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, is one of the biggest psychiatrrien in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the field of the former Auer Anstalt, now young people meet in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Orders erwary the building complex 1920 and walked it into a youth-home with educational institutions.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich east, east residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015 we set up the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural structure at the Irrenaissance house, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was marked by 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the merchant street was named" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change led the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies on December 1944 are a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big family stayed today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a greeting-chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof where these days are working and take place on 5 April 2017 in the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slide bar the old Munich map is compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole in the Marius.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights released travel agency for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national association for the promotion of colored people has issued a warning for more colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which until 28 August 2017, calls for Afro American travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention by the state, as a series of fragile, rails-based incidents in the last time occur in the entire state and can be noted," stated in the statement of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it a man harder to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the State, which disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the journey, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have injury to citizens' rights, which will happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are raised because of their skin colour, they are put together or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints with such a frequency that we have not heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The Group cited as rassistic breach of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under fragile conditions at the beginning of the year, after having lost no petrol in custody during the journey through the state, and carried out by the police of Missouri in custody without a crime to be accused.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent report by the office of the general state of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are risen by 75 percent more frequently than budgeting.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," said chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready if there is Caurow, or to know the relatives, that they are travelling by the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 Hasseny in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassenbred 'reporting program, which reached the state regarding the number of such violations by the 16th place in the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel agency is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil liberties Union (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, published after the immigration law enforcement authorities, to conceal local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to what the ACPI contributes to a further element of segregation.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel documents are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times interested parties have the measure of response to certain laws and trends within the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidecepprojekt is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman's spruce project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestags Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have acquired an image about the site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the legitimacy of the family Schwennmann met representatives of the fisherman CDU local community together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann offers first insights into its operation where he cultivated 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows, and as many young animals, and in five apartments accommodate houses.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative disposal for the milk of his cows, so Schwennmann.</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaste comes only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also the Chairman of the fisherman, he referred to the Weidecaunproject as "fundamental importance."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not manage such strolling surfaces in a profitable way.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green space for a lot of work, much it must be processed with the motorsense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the conditions and with the toil to fight," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elterous operation and served this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct any bioenergy.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the importance of the Weidecay project and is pleased with the leaders." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported by farmers.</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the reforestation of the surfaces might be gone out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and make sense of how they can continue their operation," said the Mayor.</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers have often been critical in criticism because of their support.</seg>
<seg id="84">More than 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The unveiling surface is thus 40 hectares of which up to at least 2023 cannot be remediated.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded half of the Leader, a quarter of the fisherman village.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmer needs 12 610 euros, who had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of inception.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Tildemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you did a really good job, without farmers and landowners it will not go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss was fixed:" "" "here best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landmark line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes possible the state promotion of pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">A precondition is the presence of one of the LPR grouped.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the protracted area must not be scarce (Hanging over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman's spruce project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 cells, who wish to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The unveiling surface of 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump will take the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans also appreciate this as any other - hence the painstine Sturz Saddam Hussein on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, knew surely what he did when he began a symbolic battle with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction of the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller went out the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jetties and Liberty imitators could have haze him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning that it was written, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta was coated, "I do not want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer, which was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly correct, but as he formulate it, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the shook words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your fortless, your poor, / your crowned masses, who after that long, free to breathe, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There never has been a time in which the "finer waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller commited not in literary criticism - he clearly stated that these people are not welcome in trumps.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute. it is indeed a conflict around the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends, who put themselves in favor of placing their words on the basis for their death - knew very well that they are doing a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism, in a worn-out classical portrayal of the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in its poem the feminine figure is no longer abstractly - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives yourself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup, and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to regain this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The grand screaming of Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist for the coming from Trump, argued in 2010, that the Statue of Liberty, was argued that the American flame is said, that the American flame is doing in the reimned World: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something like.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they had seen from the exhaustive, striving, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journey on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense about seeing the world from the perspective of men who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not enlighten the way but the hate who is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle is reminded of a time when only two villi belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish Athlete are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which are to compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the crew to the team chapel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter if they were Scottish or where always they live or train, they went out of space and felt very proud and were highly motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the genuine feeling that Eiliie did quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medan, who is over the 400-m hurdles to the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 carrots in the British team are.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's largest number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Muir Sold trail leads on this path and has held five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare who runs up to 1,500 m is another Scotsman, which you should watch for a great season, which included the victory at the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the Manning capitals," "" "says that they are" "" "huge proud" "" "to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team but also in some cases join the medals and at the Finals." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about this team surrender to be that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour, but to know that my team-mate for me have been voted for me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that are part of the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here to be established athletes, athletes who want to go to podiets.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to place your home supporter and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete, and it's going to be so a great atmosphere out there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking from critics via Facebook: beating yourself not about a public office if you cannot tolerate the unfolding of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew a bit of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers suggested it for everything from domestic policy up to his political principles.</seg>

<seg id="177">He was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to reconnect with his voters and to debate his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockade of people who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is referred to as officially and by employees working with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse insist the acts of the Governors and argued that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>

<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP lost its concentration on the debts of the club on the surveillance of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change signified that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then ran vigorously invested to improve the team and build a global brand - a tougher case.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big living life: mezzanine and clever designer furniture have turned this little Earls Court accommodation into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, won in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I sought after something that was similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with them and made an offer to that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square-foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom estate with a screwable layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate space to make optimal use of the generous deck height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "says she.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end she commissioned the Architekturbüro und Designstudio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings to use and to create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The blanket was not big enough to place two spaces covered in one another so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate space where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to solve the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel station is quite complicated," explained.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces so they were overhauled, without having had gaps.</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform, but to specify the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or down the correct height. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible Erfan, two rooms in full height to place one another - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic couplight window from Retrouvius looks down to the glamourable residential area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Spraying gold furniture, silver, and vintage Serge Mouille Lighting put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to leave him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror is felt like a window to another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance offer piegted units place for all the seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamoratory space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchen are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a cloak door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went there," explains Erfan from the reinforced, furnified MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important, so if you are moving the door very easily," "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the basics - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agents will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the soil surface and use high quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not forget you in the power sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square speed from a bit as moderate in something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumption of new Stef plant is planning to restrict the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico tells us that the new leader of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the message media - in the hope to keep the boss on a minimal course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"" "" "" "as John F. Kelly, the new leader of the White House, called on his first working day with leading staff, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to fix: poor information, which got into the hands of the President." ""</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Cellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media channels.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumpsuits on TV dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his televisite is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidat Trump was upset because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of positions obtained," said the former election campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February opposite the Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote to the time that" "" "the key to keep tens Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaign to ensure that his personal media intake involves a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps Twitter habit ever "under control" was, is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe this campaign oscillors know something that we don't know other - that drupe tweets would have included more ignitions without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that has not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have made it out of him for several times, will keep away from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has to prevent it from consistently that snump controversy is produced.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that the people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by producing their dump material that may help their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the adviser, the president of strategic grounds of dubious information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by the Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump Beamte say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press pages, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he gets out to find out how they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was what happened at the end of February when someone replaces the president malicious one of Article from Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet-Provokateurs Charles C. Johnson, who proclaimed the deputy leader in Katie Walsh, "the source behind a pile of" leak "in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson were banned from Twitter because of picks, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that he has expressed false accusations in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Stallion Licentef Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document a system in order to get the trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that worked?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same for three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager as the priest, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors always strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned to the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the introduction of the body is at the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1523">A danger for people is not coming out of him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">How climate change has played a role in the interruption of the iceberg, is unclear according to researchers.</seg>
<seg id="1525">But in total, however, there have been a series of unusual interruptions of iron dals in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact-background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to the groundwork.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The KOLOSS now been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfig.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Scheldels swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks up regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfig is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of the Rogue was the balance of waxes and aborting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A completful Scheldeler was there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some fact that even the Larsen-C-Schelsols is in danger, because the more advanced edge has never moved back as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stand under voltage and could disintegrate, if at a keypoint a piece is a piece.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalists underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet with twochs to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what more secure it feels: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which in 2009 were the goal of an attack with granulates, or at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security professionals have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the outside list of the government or map, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no reprieve of violence, and throughout the country the bodies piles of violence are more and more journalists. at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto have triggered the position in December 2012 and threats now existed at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their publisher and their inspirer from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is perceived deeply, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, that shows its middle finger with the word "Justice" building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who demonstrate its smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporter debate about their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although in 2010 it was established by the Board of Directors to edit the cases of journalists, according to the Committee, the Committee adopted only two criminal offences according to the Committee under the Committee.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year are linked to drug-trading and organised crime, the murderers of journalists will rarely be brought before justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unsurned, and although the terrain is now still murderous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of safety has little utility, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to wasting my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "so long as we do not know the Why, we distrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of the 15th of May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive it just a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was raised by two men. he was shot out by his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Tölth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The skarcher ran away in his car and damaged it close by.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours do not have to move freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans rearrests in the past year and the delivery into the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battling areas of the country since rivaled factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of reduced, two-story mouse-pigeon for drug-rounder, which are bigger than many houses for the Living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace," if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Boorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder of murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cardboard fractions in the war with Guzmans Sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, suspected gangmembers bought each specimen of the output, as soon as they were delivered to time zones.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault lies in these, Valdez does not force them, after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killings is seen as a milestone in the mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues annahate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He was a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without sacrificing to the" "" "dowry issue" "", "said Boorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time the newspaper has earned a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and promotion.</seg>
<seg id="1848">They loved to publish hard-reaching investigation without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories, which no one dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, they received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot award for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez has won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists during the persecution of Mexican drugs history, wherever they go.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I would not be asked:" "" "what have you done with so many stilleries... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was fluent to a dockworkers, the friend who was generous with hugs and ratings, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">It trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, going and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them, was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also compelled them to ask their own assumptions, how they can best handle their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their canny run- and runways," to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Booquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high measure of self-relationships and self-holding.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trusting his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells, lead it away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the matter with Javier has happened."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa no longer - as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside there were two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were asked by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-scale building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half of the baiz, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who were the governor themselves as not trusted.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the Reporter has gone to the mountain scenery, where the drugs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has been on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the Brders of the former known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>

<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it came to pass, so caution was taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally produced by drugs and authorities.</seg>

<seg id="1881">Recently, several Pri-governors were accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prematures in this eatery, including a, in which a son of "El Chapo" was escaped from military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, the reader had seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the abduction.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the gearmored plant-fresser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something of the surrounding islets was lacking on the square, and decided to look more accurately.</seg>

<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the science's history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs copies - the mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-fresser, although it is covered with an armor and resembles, probably of meat-provoked dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The highly skilled dinosaurs used one red and white camouflage, to hide from predators, and used a shield, which is known as counter-circumcision, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix more in its surroundings and to dodge its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs has made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animals and called it Borealopelta resin to the Museumstechniker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours in order to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen, there was Dr. Mitchell, and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaded, a widespread defence method in the animal-rich, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprising, since the size of the real-realopelta far exceeds the animals living in today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to that the dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure due to meat-sent dinosaurs that the evolution that favoured the conceal of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who use the counter-shaded - think of deer, Zebra or Gürtuna - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey, that signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists still examine the animal on information about his life, including his concerected intestinal cord to figure out what it has eaten up as his final meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went into a river served and driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably more widespread than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which is from the point of view of the people living in community and filled the streets to challenge answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower garment and a matching crown, after Ferguson drove the two a conversation, which she had countless times before this morning, "over the black experience and the black state."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived at Ferguson, was at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camping area, as the activists were waiting for the possible non-Prosecutor of the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then member of the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field that is known for his activism around Todestrakt-inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought the project closer to the project along with six other locals followed by "Whose Streets?" in the years following browsers.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is on the movement "not about a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the movie.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Consequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, how she loves himself and marries her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unstrange - hanging around the cables by the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarcles, which you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former secrecess analyst had been sentenced to 35 years imprisonment, after being considered secret diplomatic messages about the website WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (an appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transversine and landmark disassembling, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Manning, a sharp, if some intellectual comment does not only lead to the spatial ability of DNA data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the inherent Determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already been talking about the identification as a woman, in 2013 was condemned for 20 accusations, including six breaches of the esying network, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison you have suppressed their image so much that there was only a single photo - a gritt, black-white self-headie, in which Manning is obviously uncomfortable on a vehicle's seat and carries a platinblonde tilags - with which she was associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist's portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette gum and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the drop in order to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper-azin.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new show.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit at this time and she was not photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked her if they wanted a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their detainees Muse were reverted to unequal Brieffeconds which have several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They called even one of Shoili Kanungo Illustriped Comic "Supply images," which foresaw a future in which the President Chelating Judgement would be transforming and it would be capable of seeing the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years were calling in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and starkes, since Donald Trump leads to war against informants from the government, and against transgender equality to find new, hard drives, which he should really fix, continue to defling.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When dewey-hail from all these things were asked, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery described as a written artistic statement, Manning, with its oversized signature, including (the "i" in its surname, is provided with a heart) an end to "automatic fragmentation, whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoffte, represented by the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astounding, at least in biological, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring will be that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is one side from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as they appear with a freightsarefon in the hand from the disciplines of the United States such as King-Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be any crazy about 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actual.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyeccolor of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny, but the company delivering plenty of it and we will see her more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sextolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robotics with a silicone skin, which feels warm and with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to their beliefs, "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot over the form of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it will be more worrying because many robots had" "" "personalities" "", "which would be a stepping-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sextolls have developed to robots with a silicone.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot can provide it for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that appealing it, such as spicisness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the True Companion golden Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," conveys the impression of shameness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "warmed the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So may they like what you like, and they don't like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she has had its moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it may be tired to be fixed on conversation or she may be" in "" mood "" ""! "" "</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many troubling aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the differing female properties, the contrasts on rape, if one gets a step towards Frigid (called here: represcribing) Farrah, beaten a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true True Companion Roxxxy with a VIBRATOR but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) have a VIBRATOR why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it is called on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However these sex robots are not only an fetish or just just a different sex vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their increasing refinement indicate a bit darker and deeper within our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course prevent no sex robots, and while the FRR have noted its rising popularity, it still remains temporary on the edge of Consumer Culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what has woven out of the edge-zones, can be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting, until them the free market gives permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">However, there is a certain number of means that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where the rights of women are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has vowed to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most awful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the devout bodies and the stocked eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the motion of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to its" "" "figures" "", "the robots are no real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing, which indicates the independence or anything that could bother the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, you are silly slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the expressions of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He turns Mitt Romney to the term of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binders of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the U.S. electorate, even have split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and harvest feast, there were some advice in the US newspaper with advice about how to deal with the horror of dump relative.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all supposedly throw ourselves to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trumps, families to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousins, a linear poet, which lives in Chicago and has long been busy with republicans in our family, who visited this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">They reminded me that the unit against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House is everyone who knows them, including the Republican kinship, struggling for decades due to politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a further context that this will also bring significant risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was invigorated by Trump, but the destelling effect of his presidency did the force to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalisation" "" "and tick, we refer to the gratifying way that a day could no longer be abidated by one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is a still horrible-time scenario, in the Trump republicans of the right wing, "normalised" that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as an epitome of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urgency involved - the dog on the audach who saw 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both tend to happen as a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going to be the next candidacy of Republican only be mentally healthy to qualify as inmeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousins was in town, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the Carrial of New York car parks, and the best three dollars that one can spend in the city if no caffeine is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns and the animals perrotate to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely gloom and the sound-changing music gives this in a notable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are becoming familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty years later, and I'm still not quite over the day than I found that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big rotary in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park-Karussell is still a strange experience, as here two two year old, a 11 year-old and two women in the 40-five years can go on it, and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have been able to rate the karussell, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, in this week I was compelled to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before being able to go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the Coffee-House on the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to get the rating with a 15% tipping the same - this to buy something over the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerting pressure on the server in order to intervene in a situation where no need is required.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study confirms exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients could alleviate with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects the USA around 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causing stomach cramps and blender, recurrent or bloody diarrings, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During the sufferers usually come, meat and dairy products meet to relieve their symptoms, found researchers at the Washingtoner Universität gaining that the essential amino acid tryptophan increased from proteins to develop immune cells that develop a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researchers, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that damaging micro-bs who hide themselves in the food not to penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, the imitable, infections, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without being ashamed tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result from anti-inflammatory diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments were determined that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice, which carry out a certain bacterium in its objectors.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the stones of proteins - to wipe the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have made a connection between a bacterium art - Lactobacillus reuteri - who is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to tryptophane-rich nutrition will be tolerated, less anti-inflammatory intestinal intestine stimulated, if the same system is wiring with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral officer in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan underwent a sort of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study partners had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but who had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The harms of mice were cut DNA sequentially and there were six species of bacterial infections, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them infallied with mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were reared in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they were not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grow in a fluid and then resulted in small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated by the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>

<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when referring to the effort and reads all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to look rather, why the name George Ratzinger is not found at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">They are dedicated exclusively to eight sites and he will clearly be acquitted from any suspicion of any means or co-being among the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the nonviolence in the pre-school expropriate themselves outside its sphere of sphere.</seg>

<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Again, I have experienced this in a worldly school, a state-Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the non-violence on the pre-school, are the detached dBagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">Then you wonder if it is not with his familiarity and his role as the brother of Benedikt XVI. to do that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him still, still eagerly down.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth but is: the report relieved Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media was related to the report a lot about the abuse of abuse with the regime's regime.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also applies to any processing or co-knob in terms of sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual bandages claims to have become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were sanctified.</seg>

<seg id="2935">The true problem in illuminating sexual abuse was and yet is that most victims are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "if they don't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus who would have been" "" "himself" "" "to be a colleague of the perpetrators." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Scrabble students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a survey student formed this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he had been troubled (Georg Ratzinger) timely knowledge and could have been able to have the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd, to accept that even him... Bubbles intruder or more clear or rather opened, than toward their parents, dormitory conductors, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that in advance, students and / or their environment trusted in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What affects sexual abuse is Georg Ratzinger thus release from every co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus, it cannot be threw, nor can it be prevented or brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Thus, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these contradicting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "non-violence" "" "was to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The previous Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is taken out of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem, that in the coverage everything mixed and verified to a huge melancholy from sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere, in the midst of the Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is namely, namely, between the pre-school and the grammar School of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence, as well as say we say other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report coincides from the time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogik, the cases in which Knaben from seasonal teachers have been punched and narrowed and including degrading, expropriated themselves at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those who had the capkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger nothing to do because he got the boy only to face when she had already been in the room scratched.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this one, as most witnesses raised, the theme of the preschool "tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even heavenly "states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was the other way to the domain thrust?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there has been a discipline, but there was no sawing violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were underestimated the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases despite violence even connect positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">So at most still the accusation, away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish herself and was not responsible for the processes at a school at which he didn't work and was responsible (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again since 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Provided Georg Ratzinger in front of the boards consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengetric system that even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out that the examinees continue to be performed in the preschool." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative presets, he recommended urther penetrating.</seg>
<seg id="2966">It was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, when a test-criminal has long been prohibited in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before, they expropriate themselves in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to cherish him, where the people were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can also not say he would always be away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the audition of schools were officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Principality in Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said yes, it is unfair to use today's pedagogical standards on the damaging time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallout of Anachronism," says the danger, the Past to assess this moral place.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not for what was broken in the preschool to adversity and violence against unneal children's rimps, which already goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It is all very awful and I am glad that it is finally going on.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protecting, because all that had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means for disciplining and punishment, thus earing and moving to the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When bodily punishment are then banned, he also has strictly outlawed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "the picture of his Regensburger Zeit has given Georg Ratzinger because in talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic of examinees to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: now, in the book we are talking about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, since the Domspatzen also played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't see at all that he regiment a strict regiment.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that must once said once said, without such a perfectionism, without the empowerment unqualified discipline, wouldn't have been possible to form an institution of world transpatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour.</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone, you do not even make a great singer and stand before every success, just in which area, still discipline, passion and self-overcoming themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2987">As for a person, because George Ratzinger has experienced in discussions with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: by working on the book and in addition I have seen Georg Ratzinger really well acquainted and repeatedly experienced as wonderful, humorous, landgracious, deep unbelieving and hearted people from which one could not imagine doing something for them.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I arrive regularly with how many former Domspatzen is still today, 23 years after its Emeritance, regularly contact him to read him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those not forgiven to him today that he was once in strict with them, so are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, väterlicher teacher - a stringent father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respectable child, to which they still look up and die it flatly.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite clear: everything that we preaching to him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he has prominently and has an even more prominent brother, to make the medial scapegoats.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention that behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just released, relieved him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand-areas, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen. finally, finally in peace.</seg>
