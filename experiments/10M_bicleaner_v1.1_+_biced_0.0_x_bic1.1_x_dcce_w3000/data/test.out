gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the pyramid pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with a horseback ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CHI@@ O : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyr@@ amide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses reminded of their celebrations , they are hunting in fast g@@ op@@ p home for the feed for@@ ges .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the horse @-@ career ended again already again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament awards - again in the vicinity of horses .
he was fed up with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse they didn &apos;t take care of photographs .
long was the first time in Aachen , and with it also at CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid over@@ thre@@ w the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small g@@ ala , the Golden Sport@@ pyr@@ amide .
on awards it lacks the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ rä@@ z , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already sw@@ elling him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the pyramid pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sport@@ y achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger fo@@ sters the offspring .
and thus it was the prize of the 25,000 euro in the same way .
with 15 further outstanding sports athletes , the two @-@ ma@@ stered winners on Saturday were recorded on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent are the Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ete Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the herds Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob Young Peter Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Jud@@ oka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , der Spring@@ pioneer Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard .
many of these cost@@ ume were arrived on Saturday to Aachen .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative society went into the jumping stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and tr@@ umps policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal of TT@@ P - they want both the Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. Presi@@ dential applic@@ ants are involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a foundation request .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep it rather small in a doubt and war@@ ns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to wre@@ ak the economy to death and regulated to death he says .
on the other hand , it would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ f legal regulations , and it is strong for large tax reform with lower controls - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is saying , the state has determined to fulfil certain duties , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money for it .
therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
in the m@@ ors will be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ t@@ right .
the democratic applic@@ ants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes into the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by state @-@ critical tea apart@@ y wing of the Republi@@ can .
on Tr@@ ump , there could be even cross @-@ party discussion .
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build char@@ coal power plants and restore the coal production in the United States .
oil production is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement is intended to den@@ ounce .
President Clinton is aiming to expand renewable energies with her investment programme : &quot; a country becomes the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it is probably to be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - as well as with international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ acial trade deal , do both not want to sign .
at the same time , however , they would not want to isol@@ ate US international trade but just want to protect American jobs .
the should then also be paid better , calls for around Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a fam@@ il@@ ance .
he wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump will do in that question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be down , then he says , he does not need to be altered .
but the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him before , so that budget defic@@ it would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton is at least demand from the rich , that they will pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fle@@ eing woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who fle@@ e to fle@@ e , almost certainly their everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has laid their little son in the arms .
he sho@@ cked with big eyes curi@@ ously in the room .
his mother ple@@ ad on the top plate .
until they noticed that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and k@@ issed the little .
the scene appears normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is a leader in Con@@ dro@@ bs@@ s , a sponsor for social assistance services in Bavaria , and is dealing among others with the issue women on the flight .
the four women in the kitchen are fle@@ eing .
they live in Munich in the north of one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for children and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs@@ ds set up the facility with Pro Family and Mün@@ chner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are none - even as a visitor .
the exception is a guard ahead of the door .
&quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives there has taken on their escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; men fle@@ e for wars because they are persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them a glimp@@ se of hope for Europe . &quot;
in women there are many other reasons for escape , &quot; many ste@@ ward secre@@ tly , because they see no other way away . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , constra@@ ints , Ehr@@ en@@ mor@@ den , slavery or constra@@ ints .
this is driving them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ g for example for a bottle of water call an sexual act is not rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end as soon as they gather in Germany , ir@@ re , tells .
also here , all @-@ related women in refugee vacation have often been considered to be a min@@ der@@ less and hard@@ ship re@@ used .
this leads to some 90 percent of women living in Munich &apos;s stay in Munich &apos;s Munich , appreci@@ ates her .
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women have been so familiar with nothing that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because they often do not help to help bro@@ aden it more accommodation only for them , challenges B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria the seven district rule is responsible for the provision of refugees .
on the question , if they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some will respond with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in accommodations of the governments .
even in Sw@@ abi@@ ans alone , women are not divided separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are some common stories or separate houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are to be separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacking the privacy , or being placed together in men and women , it can lead to - ongoing - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the washing rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible for women , stands in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this protective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indi@@ gest@@ ion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can get the difference to the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since joining around , we have been dealing with us , we have a long qu@@ eue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assist@@ ants : demands for new working @-@ measures
the assist@@ ants have called its union to standardi@@ ze new workers &quot; struggles for their disputes with respect to a new contract .
the Junior doc@@ toral Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( b@@ ma ) has requested its entire advice , from beginning of September , more employment measures .
the J@@ DC said that the Minister had failed to address the concerns over the contract .
assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract in July that was agreed with the b@@ ma .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; question@@ ably quiet &quot; of problems that resulted in the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given that the J@@ DC Management has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and def@@ ends official new negotiations on all its concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a response to the silence of the Government , the J@@ DC board has today provided a formal request to a special meeting of the b@@ ma Council for a continuous program of escal@@ ating working measures , starting in early September .
the disputes led to that assist@@ ants in this year was sixth , the first coinci@@ dences in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the b@@ ma assistant Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana joined the election to reject the agreed agreement conditions , which were recommended by the b@@ ma .
he shared b@@ ma members during the sessions that were still managed before the vote through 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical correspon@@ dents , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
following the vote , the Minister of Health Minister said , Mr Jerem@@ y Hunt , that the Treaty of physicians to be introduced in England .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and the official end of the eight months long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin war@@ n his Turkish counter @-@ players in the hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es Hall , I cannot conc@@ ede that Ankara cannot reconc@@ ile this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles left vic@@ alli@@ ed and he barely exposed warmth of , even for its cau@@ ti@@ ous conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , talked to his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even be improved .
the next day drive a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an proved to have heard that it would never be somewhat horri@@ ble .
I seemed to see his enthusiasm more about the opposite .
but one of Putin ex@@ as@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his intro@@ duc@@ tions : the fire of a Russian figh@@ ter plane on the border with Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s response at this time was devast@@ ated .
Putin informed him and accused Ankara , Russia fell in the back .
the leaving was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
the ne@@ ve@@ able build up will be difficult if it is not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed .
months long the state @-@ controlled media resulted in a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as would the Tur@@ ks to blame for everything .
the alleg@@ ations of leading officials were to have benef@@ ited their own family from il@@ licit oil trade in areas of Syria , which is controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this veh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was just because Putin received the president of Erd@@ og@@ an the Ent@@ schul@@ digung , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire clearly lie on hand .
Erd@@ og@@ an , first and foremost , all friends who can get , after having spent the last month at a failed , close to his ten@@ se .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey , notably the ban on charter flights , which each year brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is reduced by nearly 90 % .
in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are made .
you count on a delay in the Mediterranean Sea .
this week pre@@ di@@ ct the public watch , cheap fruits and vegetables , once the Turkish agriculture will be allowed to be imported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an added political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it has seen the reaction to the tried of power to power as a weak answer .
to this end , the continuing Gro@@ ll report on the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian state of State won in Ankara with certainty for a bonus that he sought after the sovereig@@ n state support for the elected state organs .
that is well for Moscow prosper@@ ous a self @-@ compreh@@ ension , that even has a deep @-@ sitting fear of reg@@ im@@ itation .
the summit in this Gl@@ anz@@ full Palace in the Sea gave it to Russia and Turkey , one as it described me a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Allianz of aliens . &quot; two countries who feel transported from the West and badly feel badly and can now t@@ ally themselves .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently had the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are supporting antagon@@ istic sides .
it could be signi@@ fying that after almost three hours of initial talk , both Presi@@ dents met on the press conference they had not even touched upon this issue .
the President of Turkey clearly ver@@ ified to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to empha@@ size this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no clear consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but after months of open host@@ il@@ ities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey was off the Russian struggle , it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside the country no longer available
the R@@ BS mark is to reduced more to a back@@ office according to the head of the Bank &apos;s leading office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS were linked to the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since she had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period trademarks have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sports with millions of Po@@ und on sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all r@@ s@@ our References , the de@@ centralized head@@ quarter and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ l .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer @-@ shop that will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand r@@ s@@ b will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand , among which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say that we are not pursuing a global goals , but local goals .
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities for something completely , and our employees are working among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue his six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ tive ability of different brands in his sport @-@ sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to evolve to the Bank of brands , for how we focus ourselves in inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the board of the board .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that for our customers we would have had a great bank and had these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can re @-@ make these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come .

the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie sho@@ ok on Friday its 3,@@ 000@@ ten British profit at New@@ market .
he placed on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which will be trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local racing track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Itali@@ ans is the sixth Jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the flat @-@ race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ month winner of D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it is in New@@ market because I am here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a great meeting ; it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very hum@@ ble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ek as he gets the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the barriers - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the pen@@ sion@@ ed 20 @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ed Victor Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nin@@ ja Der@@ by ysi@@ eger I had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 Car@@ rier@@ esi@@ on
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of moder@@ nity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tacti@@ cal intelle@@ ct that diff@@ ers from the other in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic Ambassador for Race , his enthusiasm and char@@ ma enthusiastic fans for many years already for this sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie at a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 profits , if he wouldn &apos;t just be a weekly and big @-@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered nearly 30 years of winners , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an unbelievable jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
von Fl@@ ying Fin@@ ishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mo@@ unts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of British Flach@@ au in two decades .
it was nerve rac@@ king .
a whole series of major tournament win , including his famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ ous Seven &apos; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash , and received a drug ban .
three years ago , he had the beginning of trouble when he returned to his sixth month , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y its du@@ kes and return to his form .
and he is still for a long time at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier , that he wants to continue on competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years .
Russia Putin l@@ ated Stab@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin brought unexpected his rod Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years of the closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as special officer for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it says that Putin without st@@ ating reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s have been ordered by his duties as chairman of the Russian presi@@ dence administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was de@@ dep@@ uty since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn he was born , he concluded his gradu@@ ation at the renowned State Department of Moscow International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the emb@@ assy of Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin website it is ( on Russian ) that he later became the leader and the heads of the government .
he said about his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to alle@@ vi@@ ate your work as head of state regarding leg@@ alists and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and have advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow myst@@ ifying .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov has long been one of the closest deleg@@ ates Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as a leader , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , that aired on television , both men said that the St@@ ef St@@ ef comes back on his own request .
but despite the le@@ ak for the cameras , here are only a few of them - mostly now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the consequence of a kind of power to be performed ?
the white is currently no one .
but the official statement - that a man who was once being praised as a potential president at once the Russian environmental policy - came across large sc@@ ep@@ ti@@ cism .
in his remarks on Putin , who are quot@@ ed on the Krem@@ lin website , says Ivan@@ ov . &quot; it is true that I have asked you in early 2012 in an interview , give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complain about four years .
as it turns out , I have been chair of the Russian presi@@ dence for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .

en@@ ig@@ ma be@@ f@@ eries in the garden in Ban@@ ff land@@ ings
a resident of gangs asked for the identification of fish help , who is de@@ af in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act on the 75 fish@@ ings around Sand@@ als , which were sp@@ elled from a fountain .

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means the bridge collap@@ sed with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closure of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is the completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 she@@ aths .
the £ 1,35 billion expensive project is supposed to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown , built a visit today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment during the construction of the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
we are all witnesses of a cra@@ ft@@ sman@@ ship of a truly ep@@ ic degree of this project with more than 30.000 tons of concrete and steel , which alone was used for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the Br@@ ück@@ er a tricky activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the passengers .
in total , nearly 79 % of total bri@@ cks are at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks today gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the deck , which means the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to his place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure will be a significant milestone in each ro@@ ast@@ ing project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project provides a tr@@ end@@ setting trend @-@ setting and deep @-@ construction .
after installing the last road section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap in the north or country side .
this was reached by foot of the northern Zu@@ bring@@ er@@ brücke 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 metres long , about 6,000 tons , weighing about 3 % at the top .
heal , as the toler@@ ances , on which the team runs , win@@ ch - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
save in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive today &quot;
three men have &quot; happiness or being alive after they were tos@@ sed by a fishing boat from fro@@ g@@ ey .
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI Professional station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm , after a crew ob@@ serving the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty effort to swim while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat is close to itself and placed us the worst thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station from Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; luckily the strong winds used the boat apart from their reach until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man at the age of 60 exhausted and at a drilling without life@@ jacket has been found .
they all arrived on board the coastal boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were cast into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot @-@ engine was ad@@ owed over a p@@ c@@ ram , but at the se@@ wing of the bot of the person , which was ste@@ ered by the boat .
someone has t@@ ended today about these men today .

this alert was then his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm its brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went with her partner from the house .
in the street they met the ex @-@ partner of the male .

who builds a budget of cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and green@@ ry shall continue to mean a lot stronger in future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you respond to bad news that Braunschweig will lose some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hand@@ craft Living &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programm@@ ed .
first and foremost , it is the question : who is supposed to build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Juncker leader of Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas in future will have to hide 20 per cent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the affordable apartments can also be established in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the major dispute in the Town Hall is however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want investors to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as as 20 percent of apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new municipal housing programme which is going to cost million and still has to be financed , will provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left still wants hard@@ ship for investors .
regardless of its , so Brat@@ mann , may be a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; will the concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept design &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be implemented for additional responsibilities in the construction administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the professionals .
however , the program is not entirely up : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , those should be built in any case .
but how do you compare the loss of more about 1300 favourable apartments , whose support will be extended in the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments only by 2020 .
to prevent this , the budget@@ ary political spokes@@ woman of Nicole Palm , should now be b@@ apti@@ zed any ties by the town .
furthermore , you would have to be thought of re@@ ap the apartments back into the prize .
this is possible in the West town .
one fell sw@@ oop to solve the problem .
because in the West town the dates are running on the end of the year .
some 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of affordable apartments there .
only : this is the owners , the housing companies do not .
for the number of social housing researchers in the West town is again dra@@ st@@ ically , re@@ moves from the goal of so @-@ called b@@ aking mixture .
a concentration of social @-@ weak in only a few urban areas will not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens hope that there will be no movement in the discussion yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fr@@ ame@@ Director Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean is that a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it &apos;s amazed to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and child to play no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , scre@@ ens on scre@@ ens , has been painted over the last decade of many .
Pok@@ emon Go is about to pick people up from the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games , and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were created on the characters , which were created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later made a cartoon animations , game cards and other spin@@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena in the popular culture , the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand early July something .
the market introduction in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players move out with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons which will be trac@@ ed with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screens@@ hot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , shut up with the boat and j@@ umped out for the search of the sofa .
in the US the game introduced a considerable rise in incre@@ ments , which with@@ draws the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogra@@ m , an App for Apple Watch , distributed to 35.@@ 000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after market launch of the game , the number of succ@@ essive people exercising each day 30 minutes by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get involved in the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ge on do@@ ve ears , because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look promising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless the importance of sport can not be assessed .
those who regularly drives sports , reduces its opportunities to climb to cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight loss , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to cause them here .
but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it takes people to do something outdoors , that they are fun .
thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
however , there are also m@@ oll@@ ric toys that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it mean ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow up our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game do .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
because of poker &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the Apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , and being able to help many people on hunting , more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old gymn@@ ast er@@ umb@@ bells ring on Thursday for the Mehr@@ kamp@@ ft@@ it@@ el and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world prior to the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
your overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ ers@@ sc@@ as@@ sm@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ alli@@ g@@ ator Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans : Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ bo on the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken during the individual multi @-@ day women during the upcoming summer season in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth heter@@ osex@@ ual American female that wins a Multi@@ kamp@@ ft@@ it@@ el and a total of the fifth , while it soli@@ di@@ fies its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke out in tears when its end result was shown and her long journey took place at this moment .
this success presents them in the same league like unique Ath@@ l@@ ets , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has domin@@ ates its sport , 15 world cup - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lou rescue on from her told she is the best Tur@@ ner@@ ist that I have ever seen . &quot;
they expected a final test in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the Americans at Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace perfect after they won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ season of women at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , won

though it existed , during their long way of getting to the top that never the future is planned , it is not really true .
part of its soil exercises - which contain its typical Tum@@ bling pass - is on Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
it is not an accident .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school cur@@ se in the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in which Bo@@ or@@ man were trained .
it has no more lost competition for the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will last as long as it needs .

the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze wa@@ ist in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year old teams &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ master &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is called by the Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ny &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a jump . &quot; &quot; &quot;

police : 3 victims in mass fall in case of music listening in the car
according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass destruction of Phoenix while they pulled down in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , they said the authorities .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator hum@@ bled eight shots from a pur@@ ist weapon , while on the co @-@ driver of the car stood and flew with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber of prey , since the Att@@ acker doesn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags , or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by an adult victim .
the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ ite by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the op@@ ot@@ ine investig@@ ates the investig@@ ator to become a close look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine ass@@ aul@@ ts of seven people and two were wo@@ unded .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , an subsidiary of C@@ BS , the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects had used several vehicles , including a brown ch@@ iss@@ ant from the late 199@@ 0@@ s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators arose , the evidence revealed that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed upon their inju@@ ries@@ . and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness shared the police with that it was not un@@ common to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which was on an empty pick@@ up truck for half an hour before the triple murder and it is understood that it was the work of the serial mass .
investig@@ ator found pat@@ ron@@ kl@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as frag@@ ments from the engine space .
mother of a 6 @-@ year old with micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
as most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto the singing , toys , and of course its mother .
but , as the least of his retirement has enjoyed Ed@@ mund micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that didn &apos;t know his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto during their pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought , I managed not .
I do not create this .
I did not let myself down .
what is wrong at all -- of course one has left it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and her became indicated that Ed@@ mund could never recognize them , and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ote him to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ uto .
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of walking .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cr@@ um@@ bling to his third year and he can still not speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and biking .
he likes to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something &quot; ago . &quot;
&quot; we bring him said &quot; speech near , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical character language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some characters alone .
micro@@ c@@ ephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ders or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how life will influence the life of those with the ci@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ ding of the emotional price of a certain future .
I always asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pre@@ diction for a long time because I don &apos;t expect that someone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful pre@@ cip@@ itation for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects that were caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine doing among the Women &apos;s Bush in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics , and that is more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer past@@ es since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie , Her@@ nan@@ dez , who are inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic , is round , makes every proud .
this team is finally reflected the United States .
it has soli@@ di@@ fies the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female companions has been an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this is strength .
on the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising ol@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and the Americas .
now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thir@@ teen world cup in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez to be how they anticipated , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ routines .
on Thursday she was the fourth , heter@@ osex@@ ual amer@@ ican , who won the event for women at an individual multi @-@ event event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are seeing the top of this sport , but we do not see Turn@@ table throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie sm@@ ote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it in the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; L@@ ords Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will have only four ships in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a train@@ ee .
but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns is a de@@ ar@@ er sport and gymn@@ asts maintained primarily into private turn@@ around who are maintained by parents , who are for training , placement , travel , and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued .
the majority of these Turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the gymn@@ asts receive their overall training and this is a long @-@ term and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , assistant of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained her athletes , since they started with the gymn@@ ast@@ ics .
we need to fence the communities countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and easy accessible turn@@ around .
I was founded my Turn@@ table of 20 years .
we offer free and affordable tur@@ bo in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 ur@@ bane you@@ ths ( especially black and His@@ panic ) for national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to provide young high @-@ quality gymn@@ ast@@ ics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport .
gymn@@ ast@@ ics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and certainty for the mind .
this combination provides li@@ fel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to get up to the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the wood of the ol@@ ymp@@ ic team of Mann@@ schafts@@ ild@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass will motiv@@ ate her so many young girls with different background to start their way to becoming a healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organize more strikes , after they rejected Jerem@@ y H@@ unts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute concerning the changes by accepting a re@@ formed treaty with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assistant doctors who voted upon a choice , rejected him .
in July , the plans set out plans to introduce the Treaty in compul@@ sory , and said that N@@ HS would be det@@ ri@@ mental to a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistant doctors are supposed to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekends in order to improve care of the need to need .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the b@@ ma comm@@ itt@@ ees delivered last night into a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have serious concerns , in particular that it will meet the current availability crisis and administ@@ ering it to treat all doctors . &quot;
for just eight weeks , which still remain until the first group of doctors are under the new contract , progress is made and the time is running out .
efforts from the b@@ ma to resolve conflicts through talks to take part in government &apos;s sake and sometimes per@@ ishing at a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
that happened during the promise , Jerem@@ y Hunt made only the last month ago that his door would ever stand out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hunt have to act now , lift the up@@ lift and speak the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he should not do so , the assistant have made it clear that they are prepared to perform further work measures .
the last strike in the end of April saw a delay of almost 13,@@ 000 Rout@@ ine@@ operations and 100,000 terminals , since sick and specialist doctors were involved in providing doctors on stri@@ k@@ post@@ nat@@ s .
the ministers had hop@@ ed to termin@@ ate the dispute over changes by giving acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the b@@ ma wants to be a better wave @-@ payment for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director @-@ Director of the N@@ HS , invited the assistance to quit the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour measures will achieve not only little , but off@@ ended teams and service providers and prepare the patients , investors and their families , worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
over the past two months we have spoken to the Com@@ itt@@ ee of assist@@ ants and responded positively to concerns with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries responded positively to the concerns with regard to pre@@ m@@ ity and wh@@ ist@@ le @-@ experiences .
the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those working from a vocational training period , training courses and gender , mutual respect for training , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health , concerning the respect of agreements with the b@@ ma in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ pro Tag@@ - medication that can reduce heart ar@@ ky
thousands of cardi@@ ac arc@@ tic will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after the authorities advised to adopt this more people for a longer period .
tri@@ but@@ ing drug poli@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repet@@ itive heart health care for people with a her@@ ed@@ itary disease .
the drug is administ@@ ered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of stroke , or a further heart attack .

the regul@@ ators N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has been recommended for a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of this suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart@@ beat and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulate fatty material in the arter@@ ies which form a b@@ lows .
when the Bel@@ ag diver@@ ts , it can cause a blood pressure that con@@ gest@@ ed the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack .
when the blood pressure breaks out , it can flow through the blood stream flow and the blood flow towards the brain , which causes a stroke .
people who have already had a heart attack , subject to a higher risk of having a further risk .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ot@@ les more likely .
the executive board of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg thu@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Health @-@ related Research Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary education , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with disast@@ rous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse impact on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively during the reduction of further heart attack and stroke are among people who had already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from them .
the information on the effectiveness and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all limited the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the executive bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ata has been displ@@ aced in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government report due to corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ urs has led to wi@@ dening Bulgarian elections in Muslim communities is un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored and marked as a crus@@ hing government report today .
the former cabinet @-@ member Sir Eric Pic@@ kles attacks the police , elec@@ toral observer and Rath@@ äuser for this evidence to have ignored the evidence of elec@@ toral abuse due to &quot; super@@ sensitive approach in Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption ce@@ ase@@ fire , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives was so bad that it should be allowed the police to judge un@@ locking tap@@ es outside of elec@@ toral cu@@ pol@@ l .
he suggests that voters should take a reference to prove in elections to prove their identity .
currently a voters must just call its name and address .
the report proposes to surrender to the finger of a person unless they give off their elec@@ toral voice to prevent someone you choose twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lowers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to gain more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official commission or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only for election , but also the municipal government before the wider fight against corruption and financial fraud , which thus comes up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in east London .
last year , a special court decided that the acting Mayor Mr@@ ą@@ g decided to ro@@ de to the corrupt and illegal practices of his place .
the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; on cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he had sil@@ ently brought his critics with r@@ attle and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man shall have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is reli@@ ev@@ ous duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 people were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which a person choosing as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed in particular wor@@ rying about fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ent brief@@ ing - for the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations in order to clean the elec@@ toral system , including the fo@@ yer of wisdom to prove the identity
in his report it is said : &quot; evidence has been exer@@ ted that pressure on the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , particularly women and young people to vote according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ i or ban@@ ana background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensiti@@ v@@ ities to the Eth@@ nie and Religion have ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations in order to clean the system , including the ban , political activ@@ ist letters , in order to stop &quot; elec@@ toral position . &quot;
the report that is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration testing , in order to prevent the elec@@ toral directory to Im@@ mig@@ r@@ ations@@ - and welfare purposes .
consider options to ask for voters in order to ask for your reference .
do not take you to the finger of a person once they released their voice to avoid that someone cho@@ oses two times .
systematic review on the nation@@ ality of a person to make sure they are author@@ ised .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to automatic brief@@ ing .
pro@@ hibition that political activists can edit full envel@@ ope and re @-@ ass@@ ing of letters .
the police have the authority to judge un@@ lock for elec@@ t@@ ying stations .
a bill changed , which facilit@@ ates a indic@@ t@@ ment due to inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the repression of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Law in 1983 ) .
phot@@ oc@@ op@@ ters in multi @-@ gy@@ ms .
requirement that only English may be used in the Elec@@ tions ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees consistently en@@ force that voters are going to enter the elec@@ toral role .
Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal off@@ ences was made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his de@@ pu@@ ties for a lit@@ an@@ ship to corrupt and illegal practices un@@ developed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ izes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ aul@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the V@@ alls V@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the tri@@ part@@ ing part of Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears as the mother of parli@@ aments a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and dec@@ eived spread of elec@@ toral sc@@ ams and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

except K@@ ates Doppel@@ may@@ in on the wheel railway , many people on the Internet suggests , just like a certain ar@@ cher of the Zw@@ illing by A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in Archery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ lit .

buyer in Pri@@ mark have been heard about women who under@@ go the shop in the shop sham@@ eless@@ ly under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman went out her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ tro@@ users .
to wor@@ sen the situation they mu@@ stered her how she looked at it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf .
you encounter further and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , an .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman sam@@ pled the under@@ p@@ ants before she placed them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tasted the under@@ wear , &quot; she left again and left the business without shopping . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the sal@@ ut@@ ment , they took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the ground , moved its own ti@@ ghts and p@@ ants and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little discreet place to do it - it just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ red when they with@@ drew the under@@ p@@ ants you obviously did not like them , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three further under@@ p@@ ants before she finally decided that her was nothing to reg@@ ain and went off .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she observed someone watching or thinking about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants they had tried . &quot;
Ms Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; how re@@ pro@@ se to think that anyone would take away from home who had another person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
Ms Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , employees tried to pull the pieces of clothing from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and figure out that another woman had it out and went again and they were not washed off . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurring on Tuesday 9th August in our office in folk music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons terms
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ ta could make it safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to handle armed ri@@ rob@@ bers to distance .
regardless of whether you are se@@ ated at the front or from behind , this video will show you how you rot@@ ate the Sp@@ ie@@ e for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at you from behind , then you should turn out to turn out so you can see your att@@ acker and walk &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder . before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the dead and turn out , whereas the att@@ acker is cro@@ oked before p@@ ains , the gun from his hands . strike it with the run into the face and move back down@@ wards as they set the weapon on it .
when att@@ ackers broke down from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the drop line , gra@@ b the weapon and turn it so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
shift at the same time the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the gun from his grip on before they move back down@@ wards and establish the weapon on it .
does it sound difficult ?
take a look at the video to see exactly how it was Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ mon@@ y .
but remember that in a smoking at the saf@@ est , your money is too crowded - if you are not a Kra@@ a Grand@@ master .

&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results in the day@@ light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought that has been used to sink the sink of a bow toil@@ ette that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive but in fact they are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria , as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing was left , what he was spot@@ ted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr W@@ right became known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate his own and wonderful things .
from public terrain to stations to stations to dish@@ on@@ oting of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud . &quot;
in the film he got his reputation in any case .
the single thing he wanted , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sam@@ pling showed a L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ric of over 4000 units .
in comparison to that , L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers are fresh and less than 60 .
but there was a Russian rest@@ room , which he refused to dism@@ iss its L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ers over 4000 units , while fresh@@ ly washed their hands a less than 60
Lord W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &apos; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to the worst thing I have to go to a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is sitting here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company furn@@ ish Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us who contains both lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ inal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and New categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ ma@@ a said : &quot; we wanted to really see the consumer something new .
something that &apos;s fascinating to look to and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming with that we had said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary , we could provide the consumer of more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have put my respect for Ian , if he had learned some of things which I have advised him to le@@ ct , like the ek@@ ol@@ ous Russian toilet that will be shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things when it was simpler to give Ian to Ian , to so@@ cks and others where this was quite difficult .
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
in a conducted by Vali@@ o conducted survey of 84 percent of all respon@@ dents lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us , in particular with the well being of stomach and intest@@ inal and 58 per cent , they said at least occasionally produce products containing attached great lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us .

this was a very difficult case since it was extremely difficult to view its actions and to view its deeds for its neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have gone wrong to us and have provided us with the information provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will end some neighbors Tro@@ st and teaches the message that ant@@ iso@@ forms will not be toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a rare moment in which the usually large sp@@ uri@@ g and self @-@ confident dis@@ ultimate bl@@ ot@@ on@@ aire as something like concerns raised , such as correspon@@ dents .
after having cast 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ik@@ al Christians , who asked for assistance in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
the gu@@ ilt are false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , and he once again took his famous mon@@ ks .
Republi@@ can Hoch@@ bur@@ gen w@@ ack@@ ets
Ut@@ ah is normally a safe bank for the Republi@@ can .
a survey of Sur@@ vey@@ ors from June according to Tr@@ ump and his Kon@@ cur@@ rent@@ in from the democr@@ ats , Clinton and Clinton , ensu@@ ed .

in an interview under the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question how he would stop to stop the Pre @-@ march Clin@@ tons again : &quot; exactly as I have done so far . &quot;
and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards , this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he will make nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth to tell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not reveal it for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , either that was fine , it said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the press , the party Tr@@ ump should be threatened with the aid of his elec@@ toral campaign , he should not be able to present any better results . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ken@@ ia Ath@@ ath@@ l@@ ets threatened with the second d@@ oping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ ge@@ ma@@ ch .
after a bed @-@ out attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .

a ken@@ ed functional had indicated that the former Spr@@ inter and present Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village took a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter lam@@ b F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this is the team guide Ken@@ iz@@ ations had been reported from the d@@ oping ri@@ val agencies .
the World Association of IAAF has requested the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to ex@@ pose its own investigations into being a IAAF @-@ speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions of the IO@@ C , the IAAF will carry a assessment , it says in a IAAF @-@ declaration .
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the d@@ oping control station and is referred to as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal , and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ ia Chef de mission Stephan Ara@@ p so@@ i .
he was in the possession of the ac@@ cred@@ itation of athletes , who stood on the list for training inspec@@ tions of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 in Beijing F@@ WC @-@ Four@@ ter over 800 metres .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics of Michael Rot@@ me had been de@@ duc@@ ted by the Rio Olympics .
he is supposed to have informed about money @-@ payments for his country about rise of d@@ oping testing .
media report believes that he was arrested in Nairobi on his return at the Airport of Nairobi .
Kenya stands at the IO@@ C in numerous d@@ oping technology for some time under particular observation .
in the announcement of the IO@@ C &apos;s announcement of more than 2000 d@@ oping , prior to the Rio Olympics , it was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into Vis@@ ier .
the world @-@ anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the year .
in a consequence , W@@ ada Kenya took over from the list of countries whose d@@ oping fight against the rules of the W@@ ada are .
Kenya is regarded as the great runner nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing most medals .
in a series of television findings of the ARD , more and again pro@@ sp@@ ed , that in Kenya , d@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there will be a significant ment@@ ality of sport .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und also called for a similar study in Kenya as he had provided them in the Russian athle@@ tics .

Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
the Shakespeare @-@ Year presented the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love @-@ couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .

a Musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins master@@ piece .
the artistic leadership Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of Classical and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare .
in Orch@@ ester@@ graben the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conduc@@ tors of Dud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; war@@ med er .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are lots of Latin American ingredients within their pace and mel@@ ody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we are Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s music really in our blood !
at this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays an older mar@@ sh@@ y Maria .
she reminds with melan@@ chol@@ y about her kindness with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because they are musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there was Mary as a personality .
it says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pret@@ ty , oh so Pret@@ ty , I feel Pret@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; they res@@ embles me very , my Italian character I as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Dud@@ amel is full of praise for the operator : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremendous amount of funding .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compliments : &quot; Dud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
to rigi@@ d is for him a necessity .
you see it in each of his movements , in his ga@@ ze , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather sou@@ theastern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is all important at all !
for the American film@@ maker Philip WM . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
we have gone to the refugees , at that time the puertor@@ ic@@ ans have gone to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same issues and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armenia and Greeks have already been wi@@ ped out or marketed in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k who is also the CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement , provided also the escape of many towers abroad .
more Tur@@ ks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition .
the fire of fire as a Gü@@ len does destroy teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .

as the newspaper reported among appeal to figures of the Federal Ministry of Finance , the Tur@@ ks issued the largest group in Germany because of political persecution , recognized asylum in Germany .
on June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 men and thus almost 29 per cent of all as the asylum entitled ( 39.@@ 625 ) .
in this survey , not the struggle against war , poverty , or fu@@ tility , are not worthwhile .
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are solely political , thus by state side , individual persec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it is w@@ eh@@ e@@ &quot;
stran@@ ger Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia must not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 the early @-@ day choice will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because after far it does not happen : summer Holidays , He@@ at and Land@@ rats@@ wahlen 1945 - this fits itself .
the locals , who are to become convinced of the elec@@ toral ministers are on vacation .
the most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the country are on the island , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country .
to achieve this , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the post@@ ers hanging , ballo@@ ons , leaf@@ s , fl@@ yers and at the end of the vote apply just aw@@ kward .
until the 4th of September 2016 , the election and the last Feri@@ eb@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to give even an election campaign in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern close to the people .
the hot phase if one can actually say it has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear for his office .
the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thr@@ illing will be as strong ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ ales and what remains at the end Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ st@@ aug@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous vot@@ al campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents .
he travels through country , distributed ro@@ ses and chat a little bit with the people , just as it is already his legendary . Harald Ring@@ storff was doing .
otherwise Sou@@ l@@ ering has gotten old feet and ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the gu@@ ilt in the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of the af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We will create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have acceler@@ ated the rise of right @-@ wing guns , which will probably be able to cost the nice office now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with her nickname minister , the Interior Minister Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , when you are at the right place for the wrong time .
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel on major manifest@@ ations ; Merkel Par@@ ag@@ sw@@ ahl@@ ten located in the northeast .
but the audience vote did not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; def@@ endant Vincent Co@@ ated , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it too bad to anyone out from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U is largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual election campaign on market places and in front shopping centers with umbre@@ llas and air ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so Kok@@ ert , I just play a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the Union has marked that you cr@@ um@@ ble on the land the basis that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people again .
you are at the same time as the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the parts of the country barely any other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ toral campa@@ ign@@ ant at his collabor@@ ators is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go there where people are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a lot has been at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called for an especially committed campaign .
in surveys , the S &amp; Ds also last 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just below the after@@ math ( 19 ) .
by the election of 2011 , the SPD had still been clearly gained by 35.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , Classifieds , with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , to make the leap into the day of land .
they make a modern virtu@@ e out of the holiday needs and lay their presidential campaign into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the national Chairman of Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ toral cont@@ est@@ ant placed on a trace search for native voice @-@ like among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ dat@@ in , kur@@ v@@ t straight line with a hous@@ ebo@@ at by the mec@@ kl@@ atic lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Restau@@ ration : Gast@@ ein suffer from Cor@@ ruption
in the speed , with which the B 27 is assembled , there is nothing to complain about .
for those who are responsible for the developers , who start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end up at 8@@ pm , there is anything @-@ contained praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything pretty pron@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet @-@ Tank@@ stelle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
construction site could be moved to the south at half @-@ time plan@@ ing to the south , until the end of October everything should be ready .
yellow is also the entry of those responsible for the construction work , approximately when it comes to setting up cru@@ ising cru@@ ises .
since the construction site on Monday to the south is f@@ og@@ ging and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße into Of@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted up and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has again in itself , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens can now drive from the B 27 again from Of@@ De@@ dingen from the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ev@@ asion through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the Vice @-@ technical management of the Corporate Executive Vice President Florian King .
the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar@@ ach@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ nerst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ on have more traffic noise , because many ble@@ aches were examined and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age .
what led to some of the truck in areas of living @-@ areas .
as also the speed limit are not viol@@ ated , the community also urged the vehicle &apos;s vehicle from the grid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable escal@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who even made the situation on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there had been two to three per minute .
the fastest war with 77 points per hour in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone on the road .
since the building has been de@@ duc@@ ted , it was quiet .
for the busin@@ ess@@ men on the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the street again .
at the maps we do not like to let business people like .
but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation with them has led to sales volumes , everyone is asked to look at .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; therefore , for other companies , for whom the sanctions has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Auto@@ haus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mild decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also one that is obviously missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ exploited are the local along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds significant words .
this is already a threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants I met &quot; hard . &quot;
it failed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we need to be glad about each euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the turnover bu@@ sti@@ ff@@ led by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weit über 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street of the street is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cast back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to release him .
if I had had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been released , politics could have responded differently .
instead , government presi@@ dents Jörg Schmidt on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial balance , with the Note , the Gast@@ stätte benef@@ ited otherwise from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now , they also expos@@ es the dis@@ advantages that surrender through the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such a little funding was dealt with .
on all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his host will pass on .
finally , the family enterprise since 17@@ 15 is settled , he refers to the long history .
that other tri@@ mm@@ ers are less often pre@@ paid because of the complicated traffic performance , he can understand .
if you can not go down , it is also elsewhere .
that his tribe left again after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , has no doubt that G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird @-@ gri@@ t , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of B 27 @-@ construction on its cust@@ um@@ ers for the greatest crisis , who has experienced its guest care in its long @-@ standing history .
six months construction work , this is already brutal .
ever , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws is being rob@@ bed .
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Mai@@ zi@@ ère has now laid a thick security package .
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ite status have to do with terror ?
and what does the co @-@ condition mean to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ c@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not calling for anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
also in it , I took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister of the Interior , however , it was due to the results and was part of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commercial consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach a little time is pet@@ ri@@ fied before it presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are now the more extensive .
some is known , announced that a new security office is intended to take care of the b@@ aking encryp@@ ted communication is not new .
also , it is not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU guidelines to air passenger data and weapons .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the safety authorities is not surprising .
in the part de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , a second run for proposals that has not been to do with the SPD : he wants to place sympath@@ iz@@ ations for terrorist groups under punishment , and ji@@ ha@@ dists amo@@ unted to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ Man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he still consider this to be reasonable and challenging even anything , which has already no chances for the co @-@ conditioning system .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also .
they are partially in themselves : he is planning quick procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people before exp@@ ul@@ sion .
refugees who are targeted to the country should be purpos@@ ed to release their own smartphones and declare social media account for a security examination .
at D@@ ul@@ ets for expired asylum seek@@ ers he wants to make some even worse than before - such as such , the off@@ ences , or their Pap@@ ers consciously throw away to conce@@ al their identity .
some of this is political and legal secre@@ tly .
Man@@ ches also has un@@ balanced and can be answered questions .
and on some points - for the un@@ equal treatment of thought involving for example - raises the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be expressed in wast@@ ing that the attacks from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were refugees .
in addition , many people in face of the high refugee are concerned about safety .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that the people deeply employed , let him not cl@@ ing at times in election hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is big .
and yes , there are constitu@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD will therefore take place on the subject of internal security as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days it went up between the two parties .
only a criminal argument about the features of the Federal Police , then via a security policy of some Uni@@ ons in the Interior , where the resort continues to challenge a ban of Bur@@ ka ban and a recur@@ ring from the dual citi@@ zenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère enjoys even here about different sounds .
from a turn of the Double @-@ pass , he will consider nothing .
we have no discussion in Germany .
they are newly awakening , sei does not make sense .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he did un@@ constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is cl@@ ashed at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has only needs to show off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is quite a lot in what arguments could be worried .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the SPD is currently trying to prof@@ iled themselves on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ pond Sig@@ mar Gabriel signal a cau@@ ti@@ ous call for conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Volkswagen is still coming through .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the exp@@ ul@@ ent numbers are worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the recall campaign there is a vort@@ ex around a term .
Volkswagen will go for the second half @-@ year with the disp@@ at@@ ches .
Europe &apos;s largest car builder in the course of the year can continue to push for a plus in spite of the diesel engines , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July the core mar@@ mo@@ ist VW mainly weak@@ ened in Western Europe and resi@@ ded it once again for the total sale , as that divided in the D@@ ax @-@ listed company .
in July , the VW brand sold in July by 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the hom@@ age Germany the exp@@ ul@@ sions were made by almost a six@@ ty .
leading owners Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the we@@ aker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition I have given it in some core markets with &quot; altered economic conditions &quot; for a department of purchase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey I also rejected the British V@@ ot@@ um for the withdrawal from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the abor@@ tu@@ aries first es@@ ised first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
a great support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the most affected area of the Nieder@@ sachsen goes on to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is only a pan@@ cre@@ ation of 0.9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech .
consolidated company Fred Kap@@ pler was able to exhibit a sales department from January to July .
1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen in this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with one software subscription .
VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops alone in Germany .
in the course of conversion , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles there will be no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power .
the car@@ makers set the client after conversion a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; warranty &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel .
cause or legal tru@@ ths .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen @-@ organ , its German customers now had a guarantee for a whis@@ per@@ ated diesel @-@ models .
this would have confirmed this from the past Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ ative in the Federal Department of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Department of Transport has been confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has complete the supply of my investig@@ ative commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; diver@@ gen@@ ces of it will not be accepted , &quot; explained the Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry .
VW has adopted the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after conversion , no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place and all types of authorized vehicles have been unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it had been in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast term &quot; warranty &quot; looks the opportunity to provide customers for example a half year after conversion , with an engine damages to a workshop - and that could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of et@@ w@@ ai@@ ve other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ ary andal , to an au@@ c@@ ant with regard to possible guarantees of warran@@ ties , as it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ re@@ see demands from rich spar@@ ks in future criminal proceedings - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank President Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day@@ ships &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it a signal : normal austerity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must not fear for their pen@@ alties for pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store banks money on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0,4 percent criminal law .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ alen from September by Privat@@ e- and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or Ticket .
&quot; the first 100 Euro is free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in future EUR 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul .
he has taken up 40 million Euros for a while , which could be lifted from one day to another , and could not be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank account for me on the central bank account and now cause 0,4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for any million 4000 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost that he returns to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sec@@ ted principle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash simply lies in the Tres@@ ors of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced four trans@@ itions , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding , and are rarely used on other plant forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is caused by a substantial costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bear alone , be &quot; operating economic permanently not possible . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their charges for account , credit cards or transfer .
with pris@@ ons for deposits from three million Euros had made the Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gian and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Alten@@ burger Land with their Skat@@ eboard @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 Head@@ lines .
Michael Kem@@ mer , captain of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay compensation for deposits , this is the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks to be much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ re@@ see there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Kli@@ ch@@ el , which is made from the property a bit l@@ ush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 ge@@ cooperative Gen@@ ossen@@ schaft bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no more popular banks known for deposit account for deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;

destination plates : who does actually purchase sound @-@ plates ?
lon@@ ely men love middle aged love .
before you w@@ ander to the commentary box , to so@@ w him under the p@@ seud@@ onym un@@ all@@ form@@ ations of men with r@@ ust insul@@ ations , this statement leads from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lica of sound plates is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life @-@ nost@@ algia .
those who have recently bought a plate have been preview for ages 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely com@@ er@@ group .
it is also not a hormone characterized by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate cou@@ riers keep their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I walk in a busy road in Soh@@ o , a hum@@ ble sight , before I stop , my hands get and somewhat determin@@ ants such as : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let us take a look at it .
even if the heart falls fast on its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - are still a handful of special record staff .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand up to various men in such stores and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ go@@ w , 55 , which I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data q@@ ty : eight men aged man ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data middle ) , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collectors , question me ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
this sound@@ ed , pic@@ tured ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates which he could not afford as they appeared and re @-@ buy articles that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are out of the late six@@ ties , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things which I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend their own time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much .
this is my push .
WE@@ Z , 25 , which works with S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers whom he meets the You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
however , he also not@@ ices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and see how to buy their old records .
from the conversations that I have managed , people usually have been dra@@ fted so as to 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who sold once their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs , to get back their records , &quot; says he .
that would explain the boom to followers of a certain age .
but what about the alle@@ ged emotional significance of plates ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to realize that record stores provide a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded community .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took notice of the contra@@ sting payment system .
some pole @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound boards , from objects that in@@ voke the happ@@ ier exchange of youth .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to look mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; flood@@ ed a staff of a flat @-@ stack .
a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record the last month they have not yet heard .
the survey also found that 41 % do have a turn@@ table that never use , while 7 % of those who purchase a disk , do not own turn@@ table .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I am bl@@ aded by a p@@ ile to the Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data q@@ ty : three men aged middle ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ nival .
&quot; someone just came here especially here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ ar sound@@ ing plate so that I can put them into the shelf . &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more products @-@ duty , less musical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ table player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older who only get started .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the sil@@ ls almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I deer .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and women aged man .
even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts new@@ ester synth@@ esi@@ - and sex@@ ach@@ servic@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz , from loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them does not see lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ reg@@ im@@ en are difficult to as@@ certain when you stand in next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in the business for several minutes and looks at the so@@ ws of the plates .
it is more of a window @-@ w@@ ool than a big one .
you do not earn much , therefore the collector of sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from one computer or another , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a de@@ pl@@ ished si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is truly unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of turn@@ tables : urban clothes .
while I share the ten@@ se , the Je@@ ans @-@ Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , I watch a group of young teen@@ ager , who will be group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter become superior to buy a cros@@ ley player .
on the left is a stair@@ ways , a wall full of plates of Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
nobody looks at her - maybe because she is only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp it .
it is pure &quot; turn@@ table &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money to the industry , and some customers can send to the depths of So@@ y for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , who is the one that ranks the most for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research was revealed , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are , let them , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the great number of female gath@@ ers and disco@@ s that exist in reality , record ju@@ ices and On@@ line@@ for@@ s .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the st@@ rolling through turn@@ tables of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while gaz@@ ing the star@@ ing view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year old moder@@ ator , holding about the shoulders of un@@ fores@@ een men aged man .

French Court issued an offer on demol@@ ition of stores in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais , do@@ zens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais , in which thousands of refugees live , settle down .
in an court proceedings this week ar@@ gues the authorities in Calais that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ visional businesses , in which individuals within the camp goods , of cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ soft , sell hairdres@@ ser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in tent@@ ative restaurants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pre@@ f@@ ecture , argu@@ ed that these places would be de@@ ed down , because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire@@ side and risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
humanitarian groups agreed to the court that the business and restaurants are important , since the free meals that were offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups that would offer enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they come out that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a judgment in Lille decided that there is no legal basis for exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 pro@@ visional business , but they ad@@ mits that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Calais &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the food outlets , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely people live , which live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet hits between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by low @-@ cus@@ hion , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is non @-@ profit @-@ operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um , for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the pet@@ ition to maintain the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian he said that closing time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for the children of which the last eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid agencies help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Auberge des Mig@@ rants dro@@ w@@ ned on Friday that the number of victims in the jungle have risen to over 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep rise in new ank@@ ings in the course of summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany law@@ ful will have to adjust himself to the next generation speed of speed : in different federal states , inter alia in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective in a position .
the fut@@ urist@@ ic @-@ acting end@@ ogen@@ ic trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can for example be deplo@@ yed at un@@ event@@ ful points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway building or to set bridges bridges , with a temporary lift , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary b@@ lit@@ zer for compliance with speed limit .
a durable complex can be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery is holding in un@@ interrupted measurement operation five days , the case data is encryp@@ ted via a mo@@ dem .
laser measurement technology can also be captured across several tracks at the same time .
variable speeds as well as flow har@@ b@@ ings by time , stri@@ pes and vehicle class can also be monitored .

great Britain takes place in silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold gets lost
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the shape of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji ert@@ ted a master@@ class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , desc@@ ending , line @-@ breaking and ro@@ her strength to gain gold - its first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color .
the defeat was failed because of the non @-@ bad drum &apos;s price of the silver med@@ al - Great Britain on this day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament where they could swal@@ low New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the oks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
however , irrespective of this form had a 15 @-@ man team be@@ aten in one form .
it might be for GB a sol@@ ace - but it is likely not - that at least a br@@ ite morning will have a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef Ben Ryan , the former administrator of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
just eight years ago , she lost her playing at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this b@@ appe will over@@ see , but the progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji was mar@@ vel@@ ous and allowed the attacks GB@@ s out of fun cap@@ es .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at the time when one was driving in driving buses . the World Series winners go 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ w@@ ai put another attack on the right corner , which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly put the ball up .
a rag@@ ing t@@ oss of Mitchell stops the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa reached a third goal , but it has reli@@ ed Fi@@ ji only up .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a is located in the right corner a touch@@ down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for the GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still a minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ cip@@ her by additional weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed to line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still p@@ itted .
so it is also .
the GB introduced basic changes to the half time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant intermediate @-@ play of fe@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on launched an attempt for the UK , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game had been running long in favor of the South @-@ cons@@ ular , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not hard to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s play@@ ful approach .
M@@ ata V@@ ili@@ ame continued the i @-@ Tü@@ pfel@@ chen , with a further attempt in the last seconds .
the wh@@ ff r@@ ön@@ ed , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged up and the GB k@@ ick@@ ed crus@@ h@@ ingly defeated in the lawn .
earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain went to South Africa in a scar@@ ce half @-@ match from the race - Great transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown put the b@@ oks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive stal@@ em@@ ate and recorded a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late premiere of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ seaside team , secured the profit - and therefore the silver med@@ al .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with cancer of the trainer for a stroke of rowing
there will be no &apos; gold in gold than those games and that wants to hot .
from the first rowing machine to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , which enter the story , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if it was only the two who sat at the Ru@@ th@@ sat , there were three votes in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they ended up to the second ol@@ ag@@ old in two branches without a tax membership , the first women in the history of the British Sports which had such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all you have been uns@@ ur@@ ped im@@ iter , which is also un@@ matched .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which does not reflec@@ ting the kind of tri@@ umph@@ s .
behind each gold in a row , a batt@@ ali@@ on is contributing to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and there was nobody an assistant than the co@@ aches who would not know if he was diagnosed this day , when he was diagnosed with him cancer .
how he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had the bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not , he spreads throughout .
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which held the break to a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the correct term .
I needed money , therefore I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 foot , 30 foot , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were lying .
this is how it starts .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even larger .
in the in@@ medi@@ ality of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve rac@@ king morning and tried to process his own an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties .
St@@ anning , who as captain in the Royal Ar@@ til@@ l@@ ery Reg@@ iment was in use in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an em@@ ural wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
we just repeat , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best coach of the world .
I could not have wished for a better person with the train@@ ee or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race lost during the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not compete with .
even within the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to tap , the p@@ anning and glo@@ ve had a lot in reserve .
we were very tr@@ apped at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay ab@@ ide in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried out .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we simply wanted to get a good result , going out and win the race what we did .
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ Adventure Steve Back@@ shall .
now she is just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that could have put a lot of pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ad .
it was all so new to me and I was stu@@ ffy .
here it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years as exempl@@ ary for clarity taken care of
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose group , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes to retirement .
the association is considered as &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water served as a model for the large water manufacturers .
this was the sole part of his time at the original Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
little later the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken government announced the tw@@ ist association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ av@@ arian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the twen@@ ties , 28 years as managing director .
now he was re@@ tired in retirement at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association with its headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , is promoted approximately 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides for 32 places and past@@ el with about 5@@ 500 residents .
member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
for more cities and communities there are water ship@@ ments .
the current chairman , lat@@ itude of the mayor of the Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 as a water@@ pot was appointed and appointed in 1988 as Managing Director of the purpose .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they cover from water management and maintenance activities , the budget creation , calcul@@ ating fees and posts through to Emer@@ gen@@ ts at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding events they called the commission@@ ing and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property sales in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , which re@@ produce a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the re @-@ generating of water pipes ( 2004 ) .
there has been no inter@@ st@@ agn@@ ation and one repeat@@ ed@@ ely recorded anything again because water life is bot@@ her@@ ed and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised G@@ öl@@ ler loyal , reliable and proper service throughout 31 years .
he has reconc@@ iled himself with a lot of passion for his water purpose . he lived with the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present the successful pract@@ itioner of the su@@ ction group for the nit@@ rates of the district cour@@ ge in front of the water@@ forum of the district of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
but he got a lot of praise and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert g@@ öl@@ ler received his turn by water@@ mark Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ vers who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he drew the fountain and the re@@ structure of the con@@ federation .
the biggest challenge and the hard@@ est bet were the pel@@ burst in the flood on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night round , so that the villages were supplied with water .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn , one can even maintain once , because you filled the flood of P@@ ett@@ stadt in full .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was passed to Daniel St@@ ürmer on Lau@@ ter , which acts the follow @-@ up by Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the run , after him he became publicly known .
by now more than Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1,80 metres tall , mus@@ cular , brown burned and has a gl@@ at@@ se .
by now the police released a photo of him .
it is however a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a gl@@ uc@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could even carry the gun in itself , so the police .
who Sven S. sees , the 110 should call .
the police speaks of a &quot; Co@@ vering at . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck did not want to make any information regarding the issu@@ er or the relationship between the perpet@@ rators and the victims ; however , they confirmed that a person was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a k@@ ill@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - light view for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in milli@@ on@@ aires .
financial bur@@ dens that dro@@ w@@ ned the industry from the Ö@@ kost@@ rom @-@ Förderung , are from the table .
it lead in the liberation of renewable energy sources at the holding systems for the so @-@ called suit@@ case production in the German steel industry , &quot; said &quot; Bundes@@ minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ ag@@ aus@@ gabe ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of strong negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the European Commission had planned initially planned , the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ cho@@ ke to generate electricity for our own consumption to ask for so@@ ot@@ ass .
the steel industry was dro@@ w@@ ned with an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there now will be a sales agreement with the EU Commission for talks with competition comm@@ iss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the Vest@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel drives will be replaced , in case of an ec@@ ution case of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on its independence .
in this way , the status quo of the previous regime will be largely determined .
particular importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 under over@@ capacity and a substantial prize .
last year , the situation further intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer in China given rise to dimin@@ ishing domestic demand in the world market .
European manufacturers cast Chinese steel @-@ cutting @-@ dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has more relaxed .
at the one hand , typ@@ ed Ein@@ fu@@ hr@@ z@@ öl@@ le on imported effect , to the others have bot@@ t@@ led the economic prospects in China .
clearly , how lasting the price is rec@@ u@@ perate .
the German Bran@@ ch Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp remained cau@@ ti@@ ous on Thursday .
last but last , the prices did last more smoothly .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not finally want to close individual works aside .
steel industry in German steel industry was about 86@@ 000 people at the end of 2015 .
in July the German steel manufacturer remain war@@ y despite rising prices and increasing orders .
they produced excess of 3.4 million tons good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year , as the economic re@@ unification of steel is divided into Friday .
after a short increase in May the completed quantity went back in the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is around 2 percent below the previous year .
in the coming months the association will be counting on an improved order situation with a rising expansion .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher gradu@@ ation they occupy the feeling of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ ings in a sen@@ iors .
&quot; sing me - emoti@@ onally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a sample it feels balanced , cheerful and overall vivi@@ d , she says .
however , in doing so , they are doing something good with their health and mind .
because singing is the same as a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ ker of the German senior citizens .
most sen@@ iors singers in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ ke .
through the regular co@@ existence , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures often solve , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to the other and learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says h@@ ac@@ sts .
because they exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
who@@ ever calls his lungs regularly , it does not become so fast in everyday life as quickly as the bu@@ ste .
even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen is often a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz tells about the German labour market for sen@@ iors .
in the older generations the joint venture had a much higher priority , and it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , they explained .
L@@ enz often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often linked to positive feelings of their youth .
through li@@ tex@@ tex@@ te and especially tun@@ es themselves den@@ oun@@ ces themselves inter@@ rup@@ tly denied people in long past events .
in addition , the head also requires a particular performance , explains L@@ enz .
simultaneously focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singer , which is a great cogn@@ itive challenge .
especially older people who live alone , so do not only practice itself on yourself .
another positive feature is the recognition that one drives through the singing in the choir , thinks of h@@ ac@@ sts .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem grows by the singing in the choir .
to show themselves , if I am for something long , I will better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to begin with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have , betra@@ y L@@ enz .
one does not s@@ ings alone - in 50 Zin@@ o@@ es , who h@@ ears there if sometimes a sound is going to it ?
looking for the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says h@@ ac@@ ke .
sing someone from the acquain@@ t@@ ances in a sen@@ iors , you can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church advance .
many elderly cho@@ irs will also be found on the Internet .
anyone who doesn &apos;t have access to the internet can ask family , friends or neighbours around help with the internet .
who lust has to sing , should necessarily join a chor@@ us , betra@@ ys h@@ ac@@ sts .
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - this is true for all ages .
cats reaction sensitive as a cr@@ ater to the mo@@ p of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , which effect has the set of kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
to their surprise the Mi@@ do also left the males not cold - but they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always equal .
female cats can recognize the arousal level of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ y at the Mi@@ ing of the Small On@@ es .
they react by ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens travelling in great need as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary University and the Medical School of Hanover ( MH@@ H ) .
separately , K@@ ater also react to the rest of kittens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the acoustic differences between the di@@ gest of less and strongly arous@@ ed vir@@ ons for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Biolog@@ ine Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding von der MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BMC Evol@@ u@@ tionary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation the researchers had already figured out that the duration and height of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their help is differenti@@ ated .
observed are a total of nine adult be@@ ater and eight que@@ ens from the animal @-@ keeping of the MH@@ H .
they were performed for a har@@ p of little ones who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
for the others they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more potent kittens , which were additionally raised up @-@ to @-@ date .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample of endurance .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted differ@@ ed on the hor@@ ror , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
it turned more quickly to the speakers when this cri@@ p of the very arous@@ ed kittens played .
this ability would be alle@@ ged or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have ever responded to , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men in baby ker@@ gs .
also showed some studies that women more sensitive to inf@@ ants were re@@ acted , quite as if they were already mothers or not , reported the Biolog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Pod@@ olski works with &quot; g@@ ala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r is in Turkey a football @-@ legend .
in Turkey it has been ar@@ du@@ red against the most popular football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey is once again held an important football match .
in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ val@@ ry between Istanbul and Luke pod@@ ol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clearly stated : &quot; Business as &quot; is announced .
even in the aband@@ on@@ ment of the outlet , after the overthrow of the referendum in July , the government , the daily routine of norm@@ alb@@ ür@@ k shall not be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
but even before the football did not stop .
against the earlier Star@@ k@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r presented the prosec@@ ution in a ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
therefore , by now , in America the South of South America was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ k@@ r is to be adh@@ er@@ ents to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the coup attempt .
while the initially applies to 90 days , it is still valid until October , actually that actually does not affect the life of most Tur@@ ks but as good as no effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the n@@ igh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ gu@@ ards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places in the whole country , Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday is closed on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into adh@@ er@@ ents and opponents of earth@@ gans .
especially fans of the workers club squares are traditionally not counted among the friends of the president .
what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks , but in view of the dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military coup .
and even the fans agree , no matter whether you take heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sett@@ ling .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be particularly affected by Luke Pod@@ olski .
his sporting value placed the Köl@@ ner in the season &apos;s past . proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first time @-@ time as a top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ her@@ ah@@ ce he recorded the 1 : 0 @-@ winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ AT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ er him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the award .
thanks &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a conc@@ il@@ able finish .
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; also appeared in the European League early .
in the South @-@ per Li@@ g there was only too rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to gain something .
&quot; we managed to do that and that is the most important , &quot; said Pod@@ olski .
for Master Alb@@ añ@@ as ran the game year better .
especially thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who with 26 Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ re@@ es as a sw@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sh@@ ütz@@ nig , placed the basics at the 14th century .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of 31 year @-@ old .
in the case of the AC Florence , the G@@ ome@@ z had failed to settle for a bor@@ row@@ ed g@@ ome@@ z after the coup attempt only after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario want to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kick@@ er &quot; Club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , the tri@@ m would need to be willing to reno@@ un@@ ce around a third of his to 7.5 million Euros , to make sense : &quot; his sal@@ ary with Florence we can not pay . &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes have medals and medals in Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Just@@ in Gat@@ lin was closed twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others led athle@@ tics le@@ tics and sin@@ ner can just lau@@ gh it - they fight in Rio to medals .
the topic D@@ oping still determines the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had w@@ m@@ ed out after a d@@ oping lock their starting right briefly before the games had w@@ ailed in their start ( 100 meters breast ) gr@@ acious .
it was offered a strange scene : with a laid @-@ up smile she was sm@@ elled even into the hall and had prov@@ oked it with their performance .
as determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee storm .
but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite the d@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
Just@@ in Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion can even faster than before , he is more than 100 m in 9,80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time ma@@ yp@@ ad had to sit down in 2010 a six month column after taking the pain of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after a surgery I had strong tooth @-@ pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old had defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was tested the Olympics of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ in from 2010 to 2016 having tested positive effects of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ic amine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic be@@ ating the cau@@ ti@@ ous in@@ gest@@ ion and was in@@ hib@@ ited six months .
the four most distant thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the big gol@@ f@@ aves .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ enter ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympics and two Mal@@ v@@ ous World Champion over 400 m , 2010 was well tested and 21 months been locked in 2010 .
a means of penis enlargement had been bl@@ amed , st@@ alled Mer@@ enter .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the so far @-@ fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : probably hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete were detected as many medals .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on has released its world championship title from 2005 to nine years later , after having been determined testosterone d@@ oping .
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to also im@@ print Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ titles 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
the bronze medals of the Olympic Games in 2008 received due to a premiere of the International Criminal Tribunal .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m it is in place two of the world @-@ tran@@ g@@ list .
Li@@ u Hong Kong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the world welding and gold f@@ avo@@ red was first tested in May , but must still launch in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year old world cup , references to the intake of a forbidden supplement has been found , the spar@@ re of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency W@@ ada fell mil@@ de and ran out on July 13th .
bom@@ bing in Thailand - Öster@@ mature ) - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ öl@@ l , Fri@@ day@@ early .
they suffered swi@@ vels and had been treated in the hospital , but I already have left it again .
I plan your home trip to the beginning of September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the vacations of Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g , and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ on , are also Austrian citizens , either still un@@ clear .
the State Department also stand in close contact with local authorities , so snor@@ ing .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok in Hu@@ a H@@ in , initially on Thursday nights , two bom@@ bs were explo@@ ded .
according to police , they were killed a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in , and about 20 people have been inju@@ red , including Austrian citizens , three Germans , three belonging to countries and three Itali@@ ans .
Fre@@ ak@@ early went up again two spr@@ inkl@@ es , so according to the authorities , another man was killed .
also from ph@@ uk@@ et , he was reported in the morning a bom@@ bs .
in the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver has been viol@@ ated .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country then explo@@ ded a further bom@@ b , which sl@@ ated an urban structure .
the spray attachment is gone according to the authorities in a cau@@ li@@ flower before the Re@@ vier Pl@@ aster police in the air .
finally , the det@@ on@@ ations called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several wo@@ unded .
one of the connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it meant .
&quot; the bom@@ b attacks bring the same hand , &quot; said military eg@@ ener@@ al Dan@@ ai Crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ ag@@ early on journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless too early to express themselves about possible motives - though it is all about the actions of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bing m@@ ates in the south of the country .
in contrast , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebel@@ lion or with the international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only logical sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather the fact that the bom@@ bs have been laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta .
in recent days the authorities would have kept secret comments on imp@@ ending proposals in the south of the country - however they have not been informed about the exact time and places .
still be un@@ clear , the group behind the attacks .
the police issued their officials across the country to enhance security around major government building and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ bs , but they usually do not oppose tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in , a palace , which was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the most impressive bom@@ bing it@@ ism , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to contribute to his homepage , the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high safety risks ( security level 3 ) secured for the Provin@@ ces Nar@@ ath@@ iw@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
according to disputes between security and Muslim sections of the population , no necessary travel to these provinces will be dism@@ ant@@ led .
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) paid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday appeared a few days after a controversial referendum on one by the military j@@ unta .
the military influence the military has a large influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bom@@ bs have been an attempt to don@@ ate chaos while the country moving towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism .
the j@@ unta , who had sei@@ zed power after a phase of bloody un@@ rest in 2014 while keeping the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , it has not succeeded in dealing with the military , which for years in the extreme south of the country u@@ prising Muslim rebels .
more than 6,@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok the Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ mid 20 people were killed and most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blu@@ ep@@ rint for the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is into the Vis@@ or of the federal state for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the Constitu@@ tion@@ alist in the Bund also provided the Group under observation .
&quot; we see on the &apos; identical movement &apos; cl@@ ue to efforts towards the un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ous democratic foundation , &quot; said constitutional Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ did of the German press agency in Berlin .
thus the emig@@ rants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Multi@@ cul@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by survival . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional gu@@ ardian in nine Länder - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Th@@ ur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ did said his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to get off their target audience , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional Council .
generally , they attempt to speak extrem@@ ists , to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ e music .
the tat@@ to@@ os Islam@@ ists as well as right extre@@ mis@@ m .
that is not a bad advertisement for your own cause .
the propaganda must appeal to the people emoti@@ onally .
young people are in a special way to be paid .
this is dangerous .
finally , from several federal states there had been reports of contacts with the &quot; ident@@ it@@ arian &quot; of African politicians .
Ma@@ did said , then he did not have any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind can be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ rod@@ ite - by certain people , the extrem@@ ist will change , and so extrem@@ ist .
decisive is the decision whether such persons has a controlling influence over the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the marked increase of right imp@@ aired crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of a new right terrorism in this context .
but we have observed in recent years that there can be a legal structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ ak@@ ian group .
it may be quite that other legal groups or small groups formed that attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee centres or attacks from other right@@ sex@@ ist mot@@ if@@ s plan .
a nation@@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of right@@ ful r@@ or@@ ism is not visible .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate about that many over@@ handles on the account of people were coming , which previously did not appear in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the Tat@@ suspic@@ ious at the asylum @-@ groups were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated pen@@ ters or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that had even nothing to guard with right @-@ right extre@@ mis@@ ses , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected to the example CD@@ U , SPD or left wing that were radic@@ alised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ oni@@ cles or world @-@ corrupt the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bra@@ ve performance of RO@@ BEL ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer@@ play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the aqu@@ atics centre sw@@ am the slightly over@@ sized swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia as slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV @-@ pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ te subsequently became the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
actually , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a gap of 48 seconds to his outlet , and sco@@ red the 5@@ 9th place from 59 .
but it was rather his not just sport@@ y figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless took part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ reflected countries more known .
because in Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia most athletes run , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first p@@ aul@@ ts made the round .
some media signed it as &quot; RO@@ BEL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in ten@@ dence to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abundance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ leaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ est@@ yle , did not play a role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also moved .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i attended media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool out of the Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pad@@ lock over 100 meter style .
fr@@ en@@ etic was deplo@@ red M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i back then .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned first to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a lengthy distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus non@@ slip into C@@ umm@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight g@@ aps
with an accident of a travel agency with 43 Sen@@ iors on Thursday in Kr@@ umm@@ hör@@ n ( rural district Au@@ rich ) eight people have been viol@@ ated .
two of the in@@ passengers suffered severe injuries , divided the police with .
the 66 years old driver of the foot of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to say their details according to a counter@@ slip road , which drove partly on the counter@@ train .
the bus arrived on the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman in the police Au@@ rich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation of the bus , the people could not rely on the bus and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the passengers .
six lor@@ ries and a not@@ ary cars came to the accident on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ finished travelers were brought back to the C@@ umm@@ hör@@ ing district of P@@ ew@@ sum .

the investig@@ ators called for the load @-@ experienced and possible witnesses to report themselves with the police .
the charges per Ku@@ bik@@ meter waste water is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Ab@@ wasser@@ Equipment Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ irchen 3,@@ 44 instead of 30 billion euros . for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euro ( hi@@ ther@@ to 26 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( until 18 Euros ) .
at the complex in Az@@ endorf , the waste fee is later than once again increase if appropriate correc@@ tions are needed .
after a more accurate calcul@@ ating calculation the waste price at Az@@ endorf will then lie at 4.@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic meters .
like Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was established in the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these un@@ ground@@ water facilities .
the market of Kaz@@ endorf is required due to the legal basis necessary to operate facilities free of charge .
from 1 October 2016 , European people as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ irchen , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg need to draw deeper into the w@@ allet .
the animation increases between 48 and 67 percent .
how administrative manager Herbert Schmidt showed the Panel , was a re@@ mun@@ eration of fees necessary for the waste water systems .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 - even over @-@ or @-@ covers from the prec@@ eding period of the period .
the engra@@ ving removal increased by Schmidt so that it is equipped with all three waste water systems by relatively small facilities with a very low waste water supply , the between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
thus , due to the low distribution basis , for instance , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have disast@@ rous .
moreover , the se@@ wage water in all three plants is slightly declined .
further , in the lower inter@@ sec@@ ulation period , in all three systems , not least due to their age , sanc@@ ti@@ fication and repar@@ ations were reported at a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for puppy , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt dism@@ issed that at the Ab@@ wasser@@ Equipment Az@@ endorf had to be replaced with the mechanical exposure system due to any damage .
in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ ding board the nearly 20 year old fol@@ d@@ ged factor had to be out@@ dated about 20 years ago and at the pond treatment Lop@@ p after nearly 20 years of operation the first cl@@ apping set has been developed and an additional venti@@ l@@ ent pay@@ load to be able to hold the water legal requirements in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this extraordinary expenditure the advanced supervis@@ or and maintenance costs came to be considered in accordance with the new energy period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 was significantly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that at low waste water in the three systems the out@@ lay for the operation and maintenance is fully transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , he added Schmidt , the market @-@ community of large maintenance costs in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years .
the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious long before using stone houses on a long time , especially since we cannot expand the uti@@ lizing of the water @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al for these installations , because it is a defic@@ its facilities .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; -@@ Eff@@ ect is critic@@ ized as asi@@ an car@@ ic@@ ature
Snap@@ chat tells you that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ ble against breeds .
with its fil@@ tering tool , there is Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already apart as absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Light@@ painting painting .
the filters are un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted , autonom@@ ous tools , which generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ections every day .
all mis@@ steps go to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have with@@ drawn in the past criticism that they have been accused of having the App Black@@ face carriage , or white skin as beauty ideal .
when this week proposed a filter to some of them , the cryst@@ alli@@ ed , false teeth and op@@ ted che@@ eks got , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; schol@@ arly face . &quot;
they asked whether this repet@@ itive cont@@ ex@@ ts have pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the ou@@ tr@@ age have been widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to Anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced clar@@ ification , reminded of the filter of breach e@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose Twe@@ et have been widely used about the photos that the filter is &quot; viol@@ ated and &quot; said unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with ju@@ xt@@ apos@@ ition of a very ref@@ us@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not sigh@@ ted , but that the money was pulled into the decre@@ ed extrem@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural cle@@ at .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diver@@ gence and integration fight , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience young people - who di@@ vers@@ ed in the stuff of race as their older inter@@ viewer , could be more likely to expect .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters create an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such matters are un@@ noticed , when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 year old K@@ atie &apos; won in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineering in for medium , you get Snap@@ chat account , asking others to do the same .
in an article for medium and in a phone interview , she said that the refer@@ ential contro@@ vers@@ y re@@ fr@@ y a lack of diversity among the inv@@ enti@@ veness with Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ized the large part white , only male &apos;s leadership and ended up their attachment with a has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the S@@ ino American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours , who work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or feeling what to say against it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely has left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish its figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as private company .
on Thursday , there were Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to an intercom , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible who presented herself on under @-@ presented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on its turn , is that her Snap@@ chat account will be closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ k@@ . . &quot;
military performance acci@@ dental ISIS intelligence information , presents Committee of Congress
Mil@@ itä@@ ran@@ ties of the United States Central Command changed decis@@ i@@ fiable Information in order to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual states were allowed in a report presented by Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Defence Committee , Secret Services , and of the Wehr@@ budget@@ ary committee , reported from large dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment among Central Command secret services analy@@ st , reported as fores@@ een their ass@@ essm@@ ents to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operation in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; news &quot; news , which were typically sent from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren , signed regularly a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism than it could have allowed the actual states on the spot and were univers@@ ally positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; quot@@ ed an article in the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses are presented by our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ kan@@ isches Member of the House of representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guides at Cent@@ Com are up to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ sided report provides detailed proof @-@ to @-@ end problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi military forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government sp@@ ear@@ heads have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts got to face the pressure from their faces , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of Congress are much more positive than it does to the facts . &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ ul@@ s had already commen@@ ce in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , is so very clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress Member from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the thought@@ ful reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into Life after having been played , anal@@ ysts would be worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigations will continue .
additionally , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Department of Defence .
democratic members of the message service provider announced on Thursday its own findings , which by some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force votes .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com presented a over@@ ly limited process for the creation of arbit@@ ration estim@@ ations to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest authority in the commun@@ itt@@ ee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of down@@ right reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed the mor@@ ality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little room for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and Democrats urged not to have found evidence of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st regarding a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Beast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ators by the General Assembly of the Pent@@ agon , which were included after complaints from Cent@@ Com analy@@ st .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ person of the Pent@@ agon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment any reports of Congress , while the investigation of the Director@@ ate @-@ General were still ongoing .
but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have quite a diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of more complex data , and that the Department of Defence and Defence Department can welcome a contro@@ vers@@ y of the important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have reported on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is meanwhile taken by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence . )
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations of last year have raised the issue that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis @-@ regions .
the cr@@ iti@@ que of the secret information about the Islamic State , of more than ten years ago , considered a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the dam@@ aging government referred to under George W. Bush tas@@ ked with the recommendations of many anal@@ ysts , just a small occupation period in Iraq and had little time wast@@ ing about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to st@@ ating government officials question@@ ing that contrary to the statements by the government ra@@ ined against the Raff@@ in@@ ers did not have significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ visional raff@@ es had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s com@@ mander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure due to its over@@ ly positive assessment of war @-@ situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also gave the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans win with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that have ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not belonging to the people who keep their doors in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , they know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition , and are equal in their group with the British in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 win against Japan will remain un@@ batter@@ ed .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game on Saturday .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group will take the first and second place within their group .
the first place will burst the strong Dut@@ ch@@ ants a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may be out on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked their success story by their success story , four years after they landed in the past London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time in three years with a ho@@ ckey club ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a researcher of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as it could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then the year 2012 , in which to her and her team went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the national team , and with it the things began to do better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical shift , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working room in London , which we now have .
we have to pl@@ uck the rub@@ les completely around .
on Thursday nights , B@@ am opened the scor@@ ies in the first half of the game with a back @-@ back from the near area .
India was gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly strong and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took her hands in her hands .
she finished a Sprint with the flat ball over the left side , then moved into the middle and invited the ball into the gate to gain a 2 @-@ 0 management .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , as too late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling safe and in@@ different , a rapid dis@@ cord between competition and the quest .
it is as if the ol@@ ymp@@ ic fol@@ ds even would be a burning rod , which will protect from the w@@ rist@@ band for swi@@ mmer for the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can not switch the television , read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop in the qu@@ eue in the qu@@ eue at no more than Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the argument between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
do@@ ol@@ ey who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s black with gr@@ ows , could well have been made among these known names which would be made available to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ emp@@ t @-@ TV commerci@@ als , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ asts or even F@@ encer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ins for gold .
the ol@@ ymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event equal .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised : air pist@@ ils , arch@@ ery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the swimming swimming and may make it long reign .
but if I may make hum@@ ble arguments for my particular beloved , let me direct the attention to the discreet char@@ me of the tramp@@ oline .
although the tramp@@ oline has been an ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 it was in Sydney its debut , it was ha@@ sty for the past 16 years so much that many people , I was question@@ ed , did not know that it is an Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all .
this could be regional ignor@@ ance .
although the USA sent Ath@@ l@@ ete to the competition , it has never won a med@@ al in the tramp@@ oline and had one ath@@ l@@ ete to the end of 2012 that has made it until the end of the concert .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend her Gold Medal from London this year .
the tramp@@ oline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds like the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a cl@@ own@@ ing school than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am no expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never ben@@ ent asc@@ ending - but also the Grazie of turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that it combines essentially .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means something like the spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
asp@@ iring winner jumping on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , f@@ encing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they will be judged according to the official Olympi@@ ad by execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flying time . &quot;
two @-@ long athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common ol@@ ymp@@ ic V@@ ector is down@@ right .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and dr@@ on , sometimes until the finish , sometimes sometimes and back , down and down on the playground .
it is not only the accordion or the output wall , but also in the TV transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ im .
the purpos@@ eful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able even fan@@ atical - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I find myself when watching this games as something ti@@ ring .
for this the tramp@@ oline offers an at@@ re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the tramp@@ oline jum@@ per is above .
a Pre @-@ He@@ ating movement is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ un@@ t off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then ef@@ fort@@ lessly back up .
again there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no hur@@ ried attack on the target , no w@@ öl@@ ben in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and angels of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; which of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will shine as part of a afternoon blo@@ c at both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the middle of the Olympics , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one , which is likely to be over@@ looked in general tumor .
if the Con@@ sci@@ ousness The@@ ory can only be reached through the o@@ gling and the objecti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air bar@@ ren , new fan@@ community .
&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a allies of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers to challenge political changes in Ethiopia , born to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of protest during the cl@@ ashes were killed by police officers .
is Ethiopia just to break up together ?
for the last ten years , it was one of the most stur@@ dy countries of Africa , a solid composite of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months , protests against the government were sh@@ aken the country and further into more areas .
last week thousands of people cr@@ ashes thousands of people to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful .
witnesses gave to that polic@@ emen were shot and killing all the protest@@ ers .
in circulation videos about the protests , pres@@ um@@ ably taken from the last or beginning of this year , such as safety , young people will strike with sticks while these were forced to make a manual against a wall .
the head of the UN @-@ Authority of Human Rights requires now a in@@ coming investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most popul@@ ous country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy exp@@ ands at the considerable speed .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new turn in the capital of Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba in the capital of Ad@@ dis Abe@@ ba .
roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia has continued to be a role model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly referred to the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was dimin@@ ished , whereby dis@@ si@@ dents were eff@@ ected effectively .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wo@@ es of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in Central Ethiopia .
the entire youth protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints that all cover from the ground @-@ use to the wor@@ ms in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critic@@ ized election last year the ruling party and its allies the last seat of the opposition , and now they control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border with Erit@@ rea ; a struggle for this pron@@ ged , controversial line in June hundreds of lives .
anal@@ ysts are feared that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ g@@ aden , which in recent years have been imposed more or less upon the turbul@@ ence and arm@@ ing themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of the fl@@ atter@@ y under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first is harmless : smart phones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians had been able to communicate through the social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet &apos;s services .
even if the government lock the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them that they were so too protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , and the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ ro@@ as pro@@ long@@ ated the Am@@ per@@ as , which come from Ä@@ th@@ ora predomin@@ antly Christian stron@@ gh@@ old , in politics and business , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , some of whom are Muslims and in low@@ land countries .
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which domin@@ ates around 6 percent of the population and the military , in the military , in business and politics .
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel@@ lion leader , was to his death on a non@@ sense of the disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tacti@@ cal genius , a man who could think around the corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in them , to perceive early signs of dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment and to use special officers in order to process opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he enjoys the trust of safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray @-@ controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time , Ethiopia has experienced such a revol@@ t 2005 , after thousands of elections protest@@ ed that seem@@ ingly according to the anal@@ ysts would seem to dec@@ eived by the government and subsequently were stolen .
during the subsequent raid , many protest@@ ers were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest was relatively quickly over .
development experts praised for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new elec@@ toral campaign , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously , this is not the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ representation of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous form of ethnic shape .
in the last month of the protest in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ ic@@ uous town , by Tig@@ ray @-@ conducted businesses and the hat@@ red to the Tig@@ ray is increasingly practiced in social media .
anal@@ ysts are saying that the protests the US and other Western allies can bring into a pecu@@ liar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over the neighbouring regions , even if she was recently dis@@ connected that she closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the West does not want to support democracy , he does not want his allies to break down in a fully vol@@ at@@ ile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday the last contro@@ vers@@ y sur@@ ren@@ ders his campaign ple@@ ading that his repeated repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious .
this clar@@ ification showed new questions concerning the communication skills of the president of the Republi@@ can , whether it is able to communicate openly and comprehensi@@ ble with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who want to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain any statements , which he might not have meant to be .
having done the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump did in terms of the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really isn &apos;t intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had given ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is just sar@@ cast@@ ic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , at which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the alleg@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help the statement to we@@ aken something , by destro@@ ying him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know the Republi@@ can party candidate .
the last storm of criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling in@@ qu@@ ility to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches at the Economic Area in Michigan in this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism on himself when he said the Russians should catch Mrs. Clin@@ tons emails , but later he said &quot; Nat@@ as@@ ant &quot; me alle@@ ged the sar@@ cast@@ ic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic borders in politics and then back to recru@@ it as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; stated by how the reaction fall . &quot; said Ruth Austin , a communication expert who ob@@ serving the language of both candidates .
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has an even estimated sound , because its revenues have gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday showed a lead with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative expression , he accused his critics and understand his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his lo@@ y@@ al comrades to stand in the in@@ convenient situation regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative might seem his or his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most common inter@@ c@@ essors , great trouble to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani therefore said to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ tions , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had set up the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that Obama was a almost unknown , small organisation , he called her back@@ bone , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he t@@ arri@@ ed the troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstre@@ am Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the Government under Obama , who served Mrs. Clinton as an foreign minister , ISIS &apos; allowed to spread out to spread the situation in the Middle East to get more aggressive under control .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump made its attacks on the media and cast them out to be re@@ her@@ ed on every one of his words and be rus@@ hed against him .
he hi@@ ther@@ ing the &quot; poor , de@@ pl@@ orable , &quot; Fernseh@@ mental Experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can not ! . &quot;
some of the Democrats has ple@@ dges over Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ts for ERS than just another proof that he is im@@ perfect for the president of the President .
once more than the price of the market arrives , Café in Green@@ point return
ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ itable Café in William@@ sburg , in which you could only pay cash it had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years it was good coffee .
of course the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front is eliminated .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced the b in the summer of 2014 , sold so@@ ap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
locals advised it as last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ goo@@ dies wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel apart and ver@@ b is now a so@@ ap shop . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also a re @-@ discovery .
a re@@ vit@@ alised verse Cafe opened final November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north from its original location .
the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but has still some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cis@@ co Rodri@@ guez , a multi @-@ year member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new version , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , cultivated a lot .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els selling the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ampli@@ fier .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he was also eager to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are ni@@ ni@@ ches such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ces oni@@ ons .
there are Natur@@ re@@ assurance .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juice .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he not@@ ices a steady stream on old regular clients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also forced out of William@@ sburg &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently there was no such a visit to a Sunday .
Oliveira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the verse regularly .
even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way to itself .
after the Ver@@ b had shut down , she gave a while the coffee @-@ t@@ ines , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in per@@ b I liked &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , they drink coffee , even though they placed on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inev@@ it@@ ably made him the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven days every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual place , but sometimes he switches his Every@@ thing @-@ Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no Gro@@ ll assumed that the so@@ ap business has taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is offered to make a special so@@ ap for ver@@ b with the coffee @-@ cool@@ ed coffee of the cafes as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish citizens Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has to make them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other benefits .
a local juice @-@ company wants to fill and sell the coffee @-@ cool@@ ed coffee to the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expan@@ se on a nearby building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a trunk and said that he was destroyed in the ground as the cafe was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed of the local and the beast of a new coffee had felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to w@@ l it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as Fein@@ schm@@ ecker , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a Fai@@ ble for sophisticated del@@ i of Fif@@ th Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water@@ tor@@ tie @-@ supp@@ le .
its menu on this day was something modest : co@@ red eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a p@@ au@@ men@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans to eat how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese food in the U.S. , while in her book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house located on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latest cooperation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ por@@ ters at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a little , local ab@@ ov@@ ens in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in the store since the stock exchange in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh@@ water sand@@ wich with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn ate with potato p@@ oul@@ ree and vegetables .
when the re@@ porter was be@@ aten , this was the pair for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man .
there was Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , Leb@@ er@@ kä@@ se and Boh@@ nen@@ bro@@ t .
they were made from an ingredient and some cheap , which stretches into the ingredient .
imagine so many varieties of ge@@ ars to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ il gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have put in the stomach as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ached for male field workers and it was served fresh past@@ el past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans , who sent to star@@ ing Europeans during the First World War . &quot; A Square meal &quot; paints the paths that the country per@@ ished with it no longer the Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land .
&quot; it was a time when the food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject was , &quot; beg@@ ged co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
just as stra@@ ined the new Bud@@ dies : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and cas@@ ser@@ ole were to cor@@ ro@@ ses to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ ole itself as &quot; wonderful way , Es@@ sens@@ ed res@@ our@@ es , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , as ch@@ efs we hide from a kre@@ mi@@ gen Sau@@ ce .
fresh fruit was replaced by billi@@ ger@@ es dry .
the meat that was the centre of American cuisine for years has grown to a rare ser@@ ost luxury .
pecu@@ liar mix@@ tures have been tried , since a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nour@@ ish liter@@ acy had always stood before taste or even healthy kitchenette .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man made a dish from this epoch , b@@ aked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular addition to mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continued on : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ butter and b@@ aked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
as never before or since , exagger@@ ated budgets - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Leit@@ ress of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country of such .
by published R@@ eci@@ pes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household sp@@ ants &quot; and the challenge to transform the r@@ amp like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square meal &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ db@@ its .
particularly tasty , the reports of the response from the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ attitude .
while he has publicly known the simple I@@ owa peasant country in his kitchen , he was stran@@ ded as the milli@@ on@@ th guy from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost g@@ ild@@ ed menu and carried a sm@@ aking .
he was really very realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt probably would have committed the same mistake when not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to rev@@ ise a temple with his stomach .
as described in the book , the heu@@ rist@@ band conducted with no interest in tastes by Ms Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt , that White House brought forth the most boring meal in Washington but also one of the most st@@ aging . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , which deal with food has been dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country came back on the legs .
the primary focus is on our fort@@ led focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was used on food .
the couple had been able to do better at the writing of the book the eating habits of the Zi@@ egel@@ mans father @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they couldn &apos;t throw the food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ surf case .
after the plate were se@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the president ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and imp@@ lied that it was a nasty trick on how to send a fancy name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no s@@ layer , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and c@@ innamon .
everyone emerged re@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ inn@@ en , brown Gli@@ ders a .
surprisingly , it tasted very bad .
Co@@ e took three times a post@@ cip@@ itation .
like one Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; A few of Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
with bom@@ bs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he continued his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save others life .
now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died with an fac@@ bom@@ bed attack of Assad regime .
Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; White helmet , &quot; a civil protection group , which saved according to the Image @-@ Zeitung so far almost 6@@ 0,000 people saved lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers will set their own life in the game to break people from mel@@ ted houses and to help them reach first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civilians who shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a su@@ ckl@@ ing from the ruins of a house , in 2014 around the world .
it made the Syri@@ ans to the bright symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of the Great War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me that is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am trying to save life , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Om@@ ar became a victim to the victim , he was talking in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helic@@ opter turned out four store@@ ys above the Al@@ za@@ dia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respir@@ atory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the toxic remains of the bom@@ b so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quot@@ ed the image of his last words before it died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bom@@ b of the Assad regime had to take terrorists .
Grön@@ land : the oldest sp@@ ine is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie most often occur in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and he swi@@ ms with good a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will get up with 150 years of offspring .
gem@@ mm@@ ed the Green@@ land@@ hai on the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour he reaches an average of 1.@@ 220 metres far .
only when it comes , the five metre long animal exp@@ ands upon sat@@ te 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be .
yet from this lon@@ eliness of life , however , it seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report about the &quot; Science &quot; journal from Green@@ land@@ hai , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ ick@@ lein from the Max @-@ Plan@@ ck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this period of life that means for vert@@ eb@@ rates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly the evolutionary bi@@ ologist has long been that Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is becoming ite .
only inf@@ alli@@ ed the evidence .
Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated southwest of Canada , Green@@ land , Norway and Sp@@ its@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius , they dive at the surface mostly only in winter .
about the lifestyle of Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ia researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little .
your time @-@ lu@@ ct@@ ose corn them when they enc@@ amp@@ ed six animals with a transm@@ itter .
lo@@ ot still make this hat@@ y anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young sk@@ ir@@ bears .
may hunt them sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ic@@ me@@ ad and look Kad@@ aver , who are from higher water@@ layers to tor@@ n down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen from 2010 to 2013 in Green@@ land or Sp@@ its@@ bergen as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was barely 81 centi@@ meters long , while the biggest 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters size .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the Lin@@ sen@@ ess of the Ha@@ ie .
this centre of the eyel@@ id is emerging already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which in it the proteins are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ ens .
therefore , after the early 19@@ 60s , your birth should lie in the atmosphere larger quantities of this radi@@ o@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centi@@ meters in length , the smallest animal contained the lin@@ ens on the other hand at carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons @-@ arms , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie had a normal carbon @-@ 14 mag@@ nit@@ ude in their lin@@ sen@@ row , which arises as a cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 335 @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ meters long Green@@ land@@ hai an age of 335 , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 5@@ 02 centi@@ meters may be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Green@@ land@@ hai @-@ females can only get offspring if they are longer than four feet , was known .
now the researchers had to as@@ sign the length of an age .
as one of the animals stood with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters , probably on the br@@ ink of the sex @-@ ri@@ pe and his age in 156 years was determined , Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie becomes apparent at least one and a half centuries .
even this should be the world @-@ record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence .
the previous record over@@ holder , a 211 @-@ year old Green@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the N@@ acken was a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ en@@ tip , was tr@@ apped from Alaska .
through the low temperatures it is often running on the organism of the animals living in as@@ parag@@ us .
so they mature and slow down .
to keep warm in cold water , the animals are also often particularly big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal sheds light .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lesser animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as possible as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very large animal should end his resources rather in a long life .
construction in a double pack
with topics around B@@ auen , the municipal council has focused on the latest session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the panel took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz on the fact that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the younger inf@@ ants can begin to be able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
having clar@@ ified the property , parking and lock@@ smith , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; road path &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ strasse - Out@@ line section 1 ) an Inter@@ est@@ ing interest is nothing more in the way .
the council is convinced that the v@@ ow@@ age space in the rural and quiet residential community beau@@ au e@@ ast@@ ed young families and armed sen@@ iors equally appe@@ aling .
as it was meant to report further author@@ is@@ ations immediately at the Town Hall , via the awar@@ ding of the pitches , the municipal council is expected to be advised in its September session .
to include requests to the An@@ si@@ edel@@ ung another commercial organization related to creating jobs to be able to come , decided to change the municipal council which only changed in the spring of this year operation plan in sub @-@ areas .
thus in the area of the Unter@@ fran@@ ch@@ lar@@ n , there are already well @-@ sold commercial territory for two plots towards the straße 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ xit
this is the best way to compete with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of Kompet@@ enz@@ fel@@ ds Financial Markets and Immobilien@@ markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ xit &apos;s referendum it is un@@ certain whether money @-@ houses can still be placed on London from financial transactions in the entire EU .
for the so @-@ called European passport , they have so far enough to appro@@ ve the UK .
this is just using major US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lob@@ by@@ vereinigung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects some 10000 new jobs at the Main bin@@ nen in five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Frankfurt , so that the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , combines the responsibility of monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority of EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ RB .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is head@@ quar@@ tered , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Emer@@ gency is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg has hi@@ ding a large fund branch , tail@@ ment as well as Dublin in the region to be worse .
Frankfurt be much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
further points the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not as easy to find free quality offices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Seine , the rent for world @-@ class commercial properties were also increased by 50 percent higher than the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is on place seven , Luxembourg on position 19 , Dublin at position 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ love : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ex@@ cludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain despite Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ot@@ um &apos;s most important financial center in Europe , my economic researcher .
this also explains the power relations : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from h@@ epatitis C Pat@@ ent@@ stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. Jud@@ ge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement of the right costs , which you have created from the h@@ epat@@ its C lit@@ igation with the Pharma@@ unternehmen Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was fre@@ ed from a flood of damage in the amount of $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , resulting in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medication S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an U.S. judge a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ eth@@ ic acts .

Mer@@ ck tries to pursue Gilead , domin@@ ating the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C drugs , who can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took each other def@@ endants and ownership of Labor@@ atories in order to claim So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medications of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons deserve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and depos@@ ited 34.@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax return for 2015 , issued a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the President and her husband to receive an income from USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had given birth to nearly EUR 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ous ; the former Secretary of Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the State Department .
cl@@ assy can@@ did@@ at for the Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax allow@@ ances in the past ten years .
they paid an effective tax@@ pay@@ rate of 20,@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ m@@ i , in an opinion known .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hid behind the wrong inter@@ pret@@ ations and re@@ clam@@ ation with respect to his previous promises .
it is custom@@ ary for US President candidates to release their tax allow@@ ances , though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York busin@@ essm@@ an , and his lawyers have indicated as a reason for its denial , a tax examination by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons campaign issue in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in terms of publication of Presi@@ dents Competition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , tr@@ umps special advis@@ ers , to CN@@ N that he will not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspec@@ tions are not complete .
tr@@ umps cr@@ itic , among other things also the Republi@@ can Vice President of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have noted , that his ref@@ lies with regard to assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his busin@@ ess@@ ary and various other associations , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ looked at the subject and published on Friday a video on the internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump will call for his tax return .
on Thursday she also addressed the topic of Michigan in Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what any other President &apos;s candidate has done in recent decades and to publish its tax allow@@ ances . &quot; she said to the crowd .
Polit@@ ico has reported that Tr@@ ump did not paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times c@@ iti@@ vely addressed a series of tax rul@@ ings and tax advis@@ ers , the indications that this could still be the case .
federal control has become an issue in the elec@@ toral campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren buff@@ et that would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal as well .
during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ekon@@ gl@@ omer@@ ate has its head office here , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to share their tax allow@@ ances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ets said , he had just been subj@@ ected to a control of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before voters and not the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign launched tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqua , New York , paid an effective anti @-@ tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40.@@ 5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that only USD 100 of their income is referred to as wage , unlike the majority of all Americans .
their main state of money was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the cl@@ us@@ al divi@@ den@@ ds and yiel@@ ds of USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 were au@@ ri@@ fied .

previously , many speakers have used to defend oneself .
Friday is the telephone number devoted to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ...

the first two steps cover the lights of the eleph@@ ant with a tor@@ ch and the bu@@ bb@@ les into a horn .

a French director , with Jewish roots , un@@ le@@ ashed a medi@@ af@@ ru@@ hr after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre @-@ election , as there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of Holocaust @-@ Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; took his trouble at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lan@@ z@@ mann had to find Israel on the site choice of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries created directly from the hotel room .
how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i is a way to choose Israel via a private call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scho@@ ote him , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; final decision of the management of any Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it stood , sol@@ der in the director had even more anger .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employees of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quot@@ ed .
the Israeli amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov h@@ adas @-@ Commerce hon@@ ed this a &apos; great shame &apos; , reported the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were de@@ generated and troub@@ led by this event .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this in Germany has attributed to precisely this hotel chain , is even a even greater shame .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident generated a pretty big reson@@ ance in the internet , in which people the whole had a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some sub@@ set the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been giving to the present demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ash@@ amed you , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was called in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which stands at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident . &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann reports , the mirror reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel does not put into the list list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quot@@ ed the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of any Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an has been around 7@@ 0.9 percent .
since the International sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies in business grew strongly in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors with .
Russian companies take on existing connections with Iran while new companies are willing to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial structure is one of the biggest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 rising and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and ru@@ sted $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the turn@@ around was achieved by deliveries of machinery , trucks and weapons , &quot; said the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors .
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan &apos;s dates for this year from a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year there was the Russian foreign affiliate of around 35,@@ 000 Vis@@ as , primarily in Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
furthermore , Iran achieved the Top 20 countries , affecting the number of tourists in Russia .
one could say that the record of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year , will be broken , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the amb@@ assador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who received Mon@@ uments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

the minist@@ ries from the Seel@@ ory @-@ Ha@@ iger@@ loch St. Anna were travelling on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were cop@@ ed .
in order to appro@@ ve the time up to the next Romantic drive of all the Council of the Council for two years , the Prime Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgri@@ m@@ ages have been tested and finally decided at last for the bishop of Freiburg , where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the dism@@ issed gate of Mer@@ cy at the Liber@@ al Münster town , a special mush@@ room destination was offered .
16 min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bronn , Gru@@ ole , Ha@@ iger@@ loch and Heiligen@@ stad arose .

for the nights in each case the parish @-@ homes were at your disposal .
at the Et@@ app@@ enzi@@ elle Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller for a sav@@ our@@ y such as the increased dinner and the breakfast .
we continued on the second day over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to G@@ üt@@ enbach .
tags later we entered the stage to St. Peter , which had been the stren@@ uous way of departure , but at the swe@@ at the heat had to be climb@@ ed around 500 metres and after that it climb@@ ed off again .
the served reward was in the evening a common gr@@ illing at the bad@@ wei@@ her .
after the dawn on the fourth Pil@@ ger@@ tag in the majestic Kloster@@ kirche of St. Peter it went to the final stage for Freiburg .
appreci@@ ably easier and happ@@ ily met the Min@@ is in the later afternoon at Frei@@ burger Münster , and crossed the gate of mercy .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes up to dwelling home , as a Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stri@@ th last night in the V@@ ale team in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year old from Glas@@ go@@ w took up the an@@ chor@@ age , who had made his Land@@ smann Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the party and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to his home to a win from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England had four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , whereas Ho@@ y took the 5th of six Olympics medals .
she reiter@@ ated the trick on when it took place in March at the rail@@ ways of World Championships in London in spite of the back@@ seat of Ho@@ ys just a modest eigh@@ th place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver of Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ doo .
ho@@ ys rest@@ res be@@ got a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton studied .
Sk@@ inner was the man with which they remained , when they saw their potential in the vill@@ i , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y vic@@ tori@@ ous - and Sk@@ inner sat in the qualification rounds , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round wo@@ unded the New Ze@@ al@@ ings in the first lap .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ des was after his turn almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a Strateg@@ ic change made a large part of the transformation from entering a higher course to slow it down , and to enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as the BBC expert from and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der on when they climb@@ ed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner made of Glas@@ go@@ w said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a sh@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make a name .
we took place at the end of the end , and conqu@@ ers the world champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
after the tri@@ umph 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys there was Hin@@ der to make that he dropped on the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an over@@ rag@@ ing victory this time has not been such a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the stands like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we are so badly cast with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad again .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation , the seven out of 10 titles were obtained in both Beijing and London .
if the ometer of our advancement in the last five months is that we expect successful five days at the bicycle stream .

future of mel@@ ting from Port@@ land due to lifting energy @-@ tr@@ ages
the future of the aluminum mel@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , because the system operator will announce the energy supply contract and thus extend the supply contracts as to the supplying energy company .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria beginning this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
one for 20 years of fixed sub @-@ prevention works in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are standing at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect products could be endangered when you have closure .
in addition , it could come to Domin@@ o@@ eff@@ ects , since the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of the total electricity generation has been consumed .
in 2014 Al@@ coa , Point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , last year led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the mel@@ ting from Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closing .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation about the future of the facility , originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which combines the great aluminum mel@@ t@@ maker with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , divided it that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the system is in multilingual front of joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which combines the Chinese company of CI@@ TIC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity through mel@@ ting , &quot; the company informed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the contracts were so called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back@@ pack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts will have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this AG@@ L assumes that the agreements in the fiscal year will contribute to the income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently being limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ations for wholes@@ ale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L shared with that it already wrote the value of the agreements already in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the Tre@@ aties , the &apos; ability Alco@@ y ... the mel@@ ting to operate or to guarantee the black@@ ness to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
the US @-@ company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year deal with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have been in effect from November this year , even if a statement is guilty then why it has come back from the contract .
analy@@ st war@@ n due to the poor economic relations in the industry before the possible closing of Port@@ land mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land takes about 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts and Tom@@ ago around 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as an electricity producer this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Re@@ ality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Bandera is in the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ aus@@ gabe of the Vo@@ gue
Bandera J@@ ator , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ ator C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is based on the cover of the co@@ v@@ eted Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks done in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ il for wines , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bi@@ zar@@ res ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an ) , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ cases Rob Se@@ ac@@ l@@ yn ) , as she forgot the cover of her sister and that with a classic turn : you all have planned a surprise party .
this constitutes the most ha@@ voc of almost every birthday celebration ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you said , &quot; You forgot you ? , &quot; with the honest@@ y of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take their other girls to participate in this publicity .
with a view of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue , there is certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started .
Kend@@ alls big sister Kim likes what the Vo@@ gue cover are concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking forward to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the magazine is a league for himself .
the Sept@@ ember@@ .@@ aus@@ gabe is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference , that rather similar to a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were attracted by the 8@@ 32 pages of the gro@@ ve ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unveil@@ ing of his cover stars is expected to en@@ je@@ al@@ ous that in the last two years the magazine has still le@@ w@@ ed the magazine before the official announ@@ cing .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , there were clearly more &apos; celebr@@ ities , the mod@@ elling &apos; , as &quot; Mod@@ els , the celebr@@ ities &quot; are on the cover .
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ trade@@ amb@@ assador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga she had the honor .
but even with the minor chance that Ms. J@@ ator is described as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - under the previous category , it is in good company .
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or Re@@ ality stars or te@@ ens from today , who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though it goes all to the denomin@@ ator ) .
you are truly talented women , who exc@@ el themselves in the entertainment industry .
once the last re@@ Cover appeared , with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade , one of the most successful years of her career .
naturally J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success any .
with her reality @-@ TV @-@ history J@@ enn@@ ers position was always something ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Mas@@ ro@@ our Gu@@ ests and her colleague gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; the mist@@ let@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings do again high , when the message with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers came out to the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but in the misery , it seems to go on the point in passing .
ordinary j@@ denomin@@ ator is based on the cover of the Sept@@ ember@@ ment of the Vo@@ gue .
in the liter@@ al sense of the word , it is a model model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters will sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold by her made pictures of Cindy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the Y@@ M@@ EN .
and in her leisure time she will see the Re@@ ality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal centres each year 16@@ 0,000 people starting at
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the aid districts of the country are referred to annually by the municipal law centres , while the sector has already taken on the effects of further mid @-@ codes on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , there are already three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , the need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unfair Del@@ o@@ cul@@ ations and similar products - in their request for free legal advice and legal advis@@ ors .
legal services of the community that are already ob@@ sol@@ ete , are ready for further cuts .
from June of next year it is intended that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of its federal funding .
the director of the common district of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Joint Council centres revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ ah said that the situation without the lifting of the decisions of the German government would only be worse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ bor@@ der@@ s centers are chron@@ ically supported , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
folks who leave non @-@ violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and de@@ pressing debts , families which were dism@@ issed by dis@@ cord , workers , the odd in@@ tox@@ icity - all these people have problems of legal nature and this collection shows that they may not have the help they need .
from June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut its funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of aid need@@ y people from Queensland to be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General Secretary General and Bundes@@ judicial minister as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to up@@ lift this medium immediately so that people need the help they need in legal problems .
last year the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance at the national level .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government will invest in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign was charged by employees being alle@@ ged@@ ly killed
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump@@ tion campaign was indic@@ ted for alle@@ ged in@@ action after being communicated to her campaign leader for North Carolina in February a bow@@ el weapon on a staff who were traveling in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in a indic@@ t@@ ment which was filed on Wednesday in the Landes@@ gericht of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini gave hard to wa@@ ited for months that the matter would not be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; drew a gun , placed his right po@@ ckets on the de@@ duc@@ tions , and r@@ amm@@ ed the course in Vinc@@ ze Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his accus@@ ation .
after having had compl@@ ained with the local and regional campaign version , Bord@@ ini introduced that at least four other people had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave in the indic@@ t@@ ment .
&quot; weapons must not be de@@ fi@@ red to damage damage , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indic@@ t@@ ment occurs only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential party candidate , said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ w@@ aff@@ en@@ ean and Waffen@@ fre@@ unde - take action if his ri@@ fu@@ aline Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tr@@ umps campaign was clear that media had w@@ aged its words from the context , and that he would not as@@ sert itself to violence .
ordin@@ is accus@@ ation requires actu@@ ation from the campaign to the violation of due di@@ ligence and by Philip because of bodily injury and ab@@ norm@@ ative damage .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
on the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) there are significant losses for the government of the SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was the representative of the free research institution for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government @-@ ruling classes in the north are just under further regi@@ stran@@ ts , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin .
in both Bundes@@ länder , the SPD would be the strongest party , and therefore would have a good chance to continue to re@@ pose the Prime Minister .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ thre@@ w up by 35.@@ 6 percent a five years ago .
the party saw this according to survey only just ahead of the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disp@@ uted between the left and the Af@@ ales .
the left @-@ hang@@ ers on 19 per cent ( before 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the af@@ D would be present with 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
the Gre@@ ens refused , despite an easier losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 % ) in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not present with 3 percent in the country tag .
in the period of Berlin , the SPD shar@@ pen@@ ed the pol@@ l of the survey was only 23 percent ( election in 2011 : 28,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U weigh only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they saw this even behind the Green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 % ) .
the Af@@ D would be present with 14 per cent for the first time in the de@@ part house .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would be passing on the other hand in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 USB : the First Smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator market got on the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer lived a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half k@@ ilo@@ grams and has been as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thick@@ er and bigger , so it was also not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite fier@@ ce .
the built @-@ in memory was the beginning of eight meg@@ abyte , which would be today for about two sel@@ f@@ ils with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone .
for some Euro , lovers can still buy the devices in the internet , but they come somehow from the age of the dormit@@ ory .
20 years ago , there was also a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone @-@ maker had announced the product a few months before the C@@ eb@@ it fair in Hannover as the &quot; Office in the West wing format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for dam@@ aging standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the Communicator failed .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , if also dist@@ ressing very slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital add@@ ress@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small ant@@ enna and the mobile phone could be re@@ worked similarly as a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
pretty proud was the cost : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euros .
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one could see in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator will be the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then everything is different .
the clever phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile @-@ card of the Finn@@ s have been living an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and trans@@ acted .
the market currently domin@@ ate suppliers , which they all later came as Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people daily .
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold for about 1.4 billion devices , by Samsung and Apple dis@@ ent@@ ru@@ ed this alone 5@@ 55 million pieces .
global turnover with the equipment lies about 400 billion euros .
in addition , the well running business of the countless app @-@ providers and telecommunic@@ ations accounts are produced .
around the smartphone in the meantime , a whole industry is now being developed .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market did not come at the beginning of 2007 , but at the time , Apple MD Steve Jobs Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World launch the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he spoke three units in one : a player player , a phone and a Internet communication , everything per touch screen easy to use .
the winner of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had to watch .
you eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the S@@ ear@@ ing now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the Smartphone is 20 years after his invention , a self @-@ evident .
in the cut every German today is 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to set the Smartphone even sometimes , &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Foundation for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local community , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of the He@@ ath@@ rows , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we run a great deal of effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ itted from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought huge benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved once again by setting new opportunities for local companies and firms near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we already have 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport @-@ region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such a think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too great .
I told me that England will never be ready for the games and that we will inv@@ ade us on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to dis@@ appearing , but he@@ ath@@ row answers each asked question .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ch@@ less growth and to post a legacy of skills and employment both for the airport and throughout the UK .
we have achieved a great team at He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion de@@ vic infrastructure investment program in time and budget , by the T5 - the five years in a row of the best airport crop , was built up to T2 , which is built within the two frequ@@ ented quiet@@ ness of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the addition of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we direct these ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and He@@ ath@@ row can extend our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , to which England can be proud of .

women with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls us witnesses , after a woman had survived early morning morning on Thursday with a pres@@ ump@@ y su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
a woman lay at the dark On@@ es &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were met by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that an early age in the age of 49 has been conducted by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , over@@ drive even to kill .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been already heard , some have not yet been identified , the police , who present these and any witness of the incident to sign up .
it was opened a investig@@ ative procedure , which is an &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , finds Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter , the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve with .
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be indicated .
was a cl@@ ash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something which the prosec@@ ut@@ or has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway -- was decided that the motor@@ ists won &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night on the motorway , as it meant in the newspaper .
last year was acqu@@ itted a polic@@ emen in the de@@ ed killing , after they had survived and killed a man who was on the A1 in August 2014 on the A1 near of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had dr@@ unk and has become un@@ conscious on the street , and took the judgment .
the court firmly held that the police officer had responded to an emergency -- to a justified sense and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predic@@ table situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information on the incident occurring on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NAS@@ A Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NAS@@ A climate mod@@ ells once .
scientists at the Godd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NAS@@ A developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that res@@ embles those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have imposed with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ tight atmosphere once desired .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow transformation of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have a thin , stra@@ w atmosphere and nevertheless slowly increased .
the model also illumin@@ ates the Top@@ ology of the early Venus .
the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical variation to face up life and us@@ hed more quickly .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent seam@@ less .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS mod@@ ulations exp@@ on@@ ates the slow transformation of the Venus its las@@ hing of the Sun almost two months long , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick sli@@ ding clouds , which acts like a umbrella run to shield the surface of a large part of the solar warmth .
the result are average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that res@@ embles the evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary research .

Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of Aval@@ ok@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy went back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of the Hock@@ ey Operations into Colorado and led to a small co @-@ determination procedure for the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and proved that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as a senior trainer and Vice President of the Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; out@@ spoken the 50 year of Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I have thought how I could improve this team to lend it more depth to give it a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and the Vice President of the Hock@@ ey Operations perfectly geared to the organisation of the organization .
he also has to have a co @-@ determination of decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had been written on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation , and wish him the best for the future .
Roy did award winning the winner of the Jack Ad@@ ams Award during his debut in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Ad@@ ams Awards .
it brought the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado has been be@@ aten in the first round of the Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Min@@ nes@@ ota and missed each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches marked in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Brasil and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ wel@@ ers resume talks again , set strike out
the sw@@ amps with respect to the re@@ mun@@ eration for North @-@ e@@ o@@ worker will be exposed , whereas all dispute parties are at the table for a new round of discussion , told negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field @-@ provider wood Group have been spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally based on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the in@@ ite and war@@ med trade unions can agree that we have agreed to begin the ent@@ ang@@ ing process of the current struggle , &quot; is stated in a joint statement .
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the next weeks , which will begin at the beginning of next year to re@@ address the problems .
the trade unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , protest against possible pay@@ lines of up to 30 percent .
wood Group donated this year to its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company short@@ ening of the company follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contrac@@ tor in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required room to get through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and plans to aband@@ on his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since it ration@@ alize its business activities as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ re@@ unification with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are due to lower oil prices under pressure , an economic situation , by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Spe@@ aker Dave Anderson met him at the start of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest work@@ flows , which were taken for a generation at the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy which works for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement .
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected to spend new projects in the North Sea by an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler is the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to accum@@ ulate the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star@@ ring of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the star clu@@ sters are synth@@ esi@@ zed and in what connection are the rotation time with the planetary culture .
&quot; we hope that we experienced by the compar@@ ing our results with other clu@@ sters , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Re@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos; s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ base of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is situated 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
many stars in this star clu@@ sters , which originated about 125 million years ago , are now reaching the adult .
they are now turning on the fastest .
at peak rotation mar@@ gins reach this gri@@ pping @-@ star large amounts of ast@@ win@@ ches .
since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bre@@ w effect on the stars .
when a star altern@@ ate , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler is the rotation rate of each con@@ stell@@ a , taking the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable star @-@ st@@ ain - like sun@@ spots --
the latest catalogue of Rot@@ ation rates shows that massive stars are more slow than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull is compar@@ es the stars with dancers , taking bigger stars s@@ lower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; der Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow rot@@ ors will tend to be massive , while in@@ viol@@ ating faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star@@ base of the ple@@ ads is so close , it serves as an ideal Cos@@ mic laboratory to compare the stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star@@ ry clu@@ sters of the Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an an@@ chor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot to know about what we would like to know more about how , When , When and why stars spend their red rates down , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes &quot; .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the re@@ por@@ ation of the Ple@@ j@@ ads , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star step off
the tears running with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. Bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base on Base .
after an emotional transfer agency , the 41 years old pro will carry out the tri@@ k@@ ot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos;s &apos; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ants of major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times a Rodri@@ guez has been chosen to the most valuable players of the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year treaty was a year of 27 million US dollars every year .
in the future of the contrast , on 31 December 2017 , he is working as a consultant and youth coach - with full sal@@ ary .
as a player there is Rodri@@ guez long time with power back .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 31@@ 14 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed some mil@@ estones in 2005 .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays point out only two more bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics similar values .
but in the fo@@ ver@@ ance of the b@@ azar , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be absorbed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was , so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were banned from 2001 to 2003 , between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 he was locked up for 211 participation in the so @-@ called Bi@@ ogen@@ esis @-@ sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main suspic@@ ious , for years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida to have been eligible .
after a dispute the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done for a favor for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ are@@ well days did not go straight .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games have still got the big stage , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ are@@ well tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress In the Hudson River , sympathy expressed by fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee @-@ Arch@@ ri@@ val@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ amine
ignor@@ ance : because of a positive d@@ op@@ tion@@ - the weight of Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio did not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ op@@ ies .
a bl@@ ur@@ ant ath@@ l@@ ery had gained almost a med@@ al .
before the seventh race date , the first official d@@ op@@ ies are known to Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers in Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ Hinder@@ Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight the@@ ber Adrian G@@ inski have been positive in Brazil and excluded - just before the beginning of the already critical Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions , these messages come to infin@@ ity .
at Ch@@ en has already been demonstrated with the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mascul@@ ine means for dop@@ amine distances .
the International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time to take their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they adapted the bronze .
on Friday , Ch@@ en could have been participating in the footh@@ ills of more than 50 m Fre@@ est@@ yle .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requests from Ch@@ en &apos;s full co @-@ operation at the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited Bau@@ hat from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the jud@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the renov@@ ations of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio sick@@ ed the news about the positive re@@ her@@ ed at Dan@@ ek@@ owa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old therefore went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four @-@ four test was positive , &quot; This is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ no@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act on the forbidden substance on the ble@@ eding EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was also sus@@ pen@@ ed to sus@@ pen@@ ed , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample would also have been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ ik@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w welcome criticism of the Bible as soon as possible .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bul@@ gar@@ s stand under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus , about all weigh@@ ting the@@ ber from the chron@@ ically @-@ conden@@ sing nation cannot be part in Rio .
on Friday also the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London @-@ Olympics in class up to 85 kg was tested , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was positive at the ten@@ se ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on .
they both tre@@ ad the intake , but they may not start in class up to 94 kg .
in front of the start of athletes , especially Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the World Association IAAF GP had forbidden the whole Russian team to an exception because of system@@ atical re@@ op@@ ting the start , even the le@@ ft@@ nation of Kenya in Rio numerous bad messages .
in the swimming sport , the earlier attempts in China had also taken care of fier@@ ce conflicts between the athletes .
so handle the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ eger Sun Yang per@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of freedom , I want to commit me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the center of a confrontation with Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping @-@ sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested by the Chinese champion@@ ships focused on the stimulation of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in 2014 , but it only had to sit on a three month &apos;s barrier .
data kl@@ au : as per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ackers her sol@@ ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail@@ ed mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
according to a recent survey of the mal@@ ware of mal@@ ware specialists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes amongst 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of respon@@ dents in recent twelve months at least once , partly repeatedly from a attack with black@@ mail@@ boxes .
in Germany almost 20 percent of the companies have already been target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware @-@ black@@ mailing .
40 percent of the victims paid off by the perpet@@ rators of the solutions to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpet@@ rators are specialised in pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to mar@@ vels in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially ran@@ som sol@@ vent is clearly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ nings have been prepared to advertise advertising .
then they discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only private users have the goal , but the change to company att@@ acking was made in the last months start@@ ling fast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she looks forward for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ cloud , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as after fil@@ ing images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ted the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the press .
in order to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims will be money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ ypto@@ Cur@@ r@@ Bit@@ coin - above .
but where in private users the personal photo @-@ database is at stake , with firms about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls when a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the German companies reported sales losses incur@@ red by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business themselves completely , in case of a case people were in life danger .
in Germany many hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of health acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not say the sacrific@@ es : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not fund her to the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , their data will get back .
for managers it is difficult , in view of stal@@ em@@ ate the demand of the perpet@@ rators are repe@@ ating .
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the security researcher of F @-@ secure the users of users and the contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers are examined and coming to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to assume more money .
you agree to their sacrifice by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free online sites , and en@@ code it for example files .
and , individuals will rede@@ em to payments of few hund@@ red@@ ths of the euro , they need to negotiate partly tough and pay five digits to make their data un@@ encryp@@ ted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ol@@ ous profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , the security professionals Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware within a week . &quot;
the most likely it is that it is three or four people .
the programmers are selling their claims software then in the form of a software construction .
the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware , advice and additional tools have been purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included is a adaptation tool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the aler@@ ser then seek a further h@@ acker to spread the fresh@@ ly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one log in one of the forums out in the underground , buy the set from a criminal and tas@@ ked another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per remote computer .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then bear sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known in many companies that better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey in order to rely on R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ ers software .
consequently , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not an adequate threat to successful profitability , the perpet@@ rators are instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the potential for damage according to type of data is much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators will continue to take entirely new goals on the internet of things in future .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrate security researchers , as they could get a thermo@@ stat control on the internet without their control .
in the middle of winter the activ@@ ating of such a block @-@ based heating so many victims could be a ran@@ som for a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ r@@ ator then instead of heating in the future to block all the production @-@ road in a factory , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware might also become a topic in the industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V you will pack up everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , it proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V acts rather small , the passengers have in the first row as well as in the bond much space , it doesn &apos;t affect in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top drops out there .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 453 l at high @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l at enclosed back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ seat are well @-@ kl@@ ed like kin@@ ks and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the blan@@ kets of 1,@@ 24 m .
the luggage space can be well venti@@ l@@ ated , but the load @-@ height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .

two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are ok .
those who do not want to invest so much will get the gas@@ oline from € 200@@ 00 , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .

street traffic @-@ construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wes@@ ale street the right @-@ law breaking at 700 meters .
drivers can then catch directly from the hammer road on the right .
the great advantage : the traffic shares early tim@@ escal@@ ate , thereby improving the overall flow on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended trip had the CD@@ U Group in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the driver @-@ lane on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 19 hours .
on week@@ days from the back to the bridge over the Reich@@ slo@@ ping road and sometimes even beyond .
the reason is the N@@ adel@@ öh@@ r on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ ale road .
from here , the traffic can only be driven across the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in a three @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static comp@@ ut@@ ations had revealed that the bridge does not have the required load @-@ power to record the heavy @-@ duty bil@@ ing@@ ual .
how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated traffic jam will last , the relevant country is not able to say .
however , to be reck@@ oned with years , the bridge has an official balance of use until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legislative ra@@ de@@ ur traffic , the country is deliber@@ ately looking for the busi@@ est times in the school holidays because with disabilities is expected .
the traffic will be passing by the site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural services for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the@@ atri@@ c@@ ce &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatre are now planning a project project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people to visit a mig@@ rational and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster , Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Un@@ seen House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young theatre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; intercultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with a mig@@ rational and refugee background , schools with welcome @-@ ke@@ e@@ pers to visit the project &apos;s cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the young people in the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria came to Münster , and a little German .
thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es , the s@@ zen@@ ische Bilder und Video@@ animations either would have been possible to follow the action , so the press release of the boy theatre .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , von Spra@@ kel , and the boy Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , you@@ thful with and without fluid and migration background between 14 and 20 years get the opportunity to attend nur@@ tured classes in the fields of singing , dance , drama and music .
special offers for children and families in the theatre game and the@@ atri@@ cal cont@@ est@@ ation are in planning .
the project &quot; intercultural journey &quot; continues .
given the gest@@ ing refugee figures , the association is calculated with many classes they want to participate .
rain instead of ast@@ er@@ olls : hope for we@@ ars
the weather has made the star @-@ star gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a d@@ ash made by the invoice - but there is still hope .
the night is really suitable for clouds and rain , to observe the cel@@ est@@ spectac@@ le of the stars , said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
the weather should be good then we see certainly many star @-@ olls in the sky .
the star@@ red lips are tar@@ ei@@ den who belong to the fastest star with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour .

relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you are going to be etern@@ ally around , at night it is un@@ th@@ ink@@ ly aw@@ ake , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ up cl@@ ashes to think about sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , you are dealing with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep and more than ten per cent , their sleep is often or not rec@@ u@@ perate .
how vo@@ iced your sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of ins@@ om@@ nia , and there are many causes behind them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , board member of the German Society for Research and Sle@@ eping medicine .
what you understand , however , is the ins@@ om@@ nia , so an acc@@ ord and a di@@ pl@@ ess .
precisely that sleeping , many people find as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , fore@@ coun@@ cill@@ or in the German Haus@@ physician association with practice in Lower @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ ations are complex .
behind it can be organic , psych@@ ical or behavi@@ oral @-@ conditioned factors , but also medicines .
not rarely is the dis@@ ruption of another condition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake @-@ up is mainly at a depression often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ alth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it may be that different factors w@@ elling each other .
who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie bad , w@@ acht every two to three hours and begins to greet your day @-@ to @-@ day problems and worry , gives us an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should there be a doctor of sleep ?
those who have not sleeps about a period of one month at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised at the day should go to the doctor .
the imp@@ air@@ ment may look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , in@@ tired , has difficulty paying attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has bal@@ ances or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the ins@@ om@@ eration , it is important to find their causes .
as treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ ors , a cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or even medicines - classical sleep @-@ coated tablets just in exceptions and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire .
approved ins@@ ets in Germany there is hardly , stresses Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Director of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Char@@ ité Univers@@ ität@@ smedizin Berlin .
that is why you should first turn to your doctor &apos;s problems at first , in case of sleep .
the can be clar@@ ified using studies whether the problems have a bodily cause .
who should be in the laboratory , and what happens there ?
to investigate the laboratory , physicians , for example with snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory disorders , in case of illness @-@ ef@@ fort@@ less , during sleep @-@ drives , or if one does not find the cause of a di@@ pl@@ as@@ le@@ ep , declar@@ es Fi@@ ord .
one does not have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a mid@@ day sheep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the wir@@ ing , one goes to his normal time in bed .
in addition to the electro@@ des on the body there is a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a ant@@ enn@@ ae on the finger .
also shows a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can the problems get a handle ?
there are quite a lot of down@@ sides on which one can bet for a better sleep .
We@@ aver is counting on : regular sleeping , and ris@@ er , not too long in bed , do not sleep too long , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol most at night - then you start to reck@@ on instantly , and this is quite and certainly not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp will have with lack of medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed by Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V @-@ Team during Olymp@@ os .
in December 2014 he was at the first time of the world Championships in Doha for the first time and placed his first puppy ord at the same time .
now , the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler accessible via Facebook in front of his co @-@ team @-@ mate .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ad won 20,000 € premium awarded and a jun@@ uns@@ et 15@@ 0,000 € should no one be wondering about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ olds was on Friday on his Facebook page .
the delivery system in the swimming pool is bad , the D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls , however very good .
in this way , we can not compete with countries which promote very much and not as accurate as the issue of d@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that these controls are to be adjusted , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler should have been reported first nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain period before World Cup / OS of independent outlines of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the choice of Hamburg , who now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Car@@ ry Drop
professional Di@@ gest@@ ion at the Airport Düsseldorf
civil la@@ vers of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed to take the strength of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ j@@ ä@@ ones had committed as a ban@@ anas and pan@@ dem@@ ons .
at 21.@@ 30 . there was civil officers in the area of the airport Düsseldorf , a gang that was announced to the polic@@ emen from past theft .
the two women and two men have been committed several Del@@ ik@@ te since the mid @-@ July of this year and were very professional .
the specialists of the Cri@@ mean komm@@ une 34 can bar@@ red the di@@ thi@@ ans who have arrived at the beg@@ ining of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts of action .
in doing so they had a total of over 15,@@ 000 Euro .
Alt@@ built , a few lin@@ den@@ ies dre@@ amed , meanwhile with a rest of the head@@ stone fe@@ eler : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain does not affect the first glance , but the police counts her to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks down the road from east to west , one gets to playing places , a refres@@ hing nur@@ sery and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
in the facade of a gray house someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; literally !
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is also to be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new le@@ athers .
article on these &quot; tr@@ en@@ oon neighbourhood , &quot; such as the responsible real estate company Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain , will be preferred in recent weeks with com@@ bu@@ sti@@ ble cars .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rented requests , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
especially the Berlin entran@@ ces had been argu@@ ed several times for a hard procedure of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point for autonom@@ ous violence .
after on 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor that had been cle@@ ared together with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks long official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams cars on site , un@@ lock parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , all renovated construction workers on behalf of the non @-@ known home@@ owners , the rooms .
on the 13th of July the Berlin Court of Directors decided that the clear@@ ance was illegal , and one day later went to police and building workers under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peaceful : parents go walking with children , sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ t@@ ained smiling .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are compul@@ sory school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
le@@ ft@@ ist violence is not the main types of many residents : Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the area since 1999 , and Jana * , who raised here three children are mainly generated by the police .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern from rising Mi@@ xed and G@@ alli@@ zation .
it does not sound after a p@@ ase , who wished for a mostly pol@@ ze@@ al@@ ous left against v@@ and@@ al@@ ent left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior and the police between the land@@ owners and their neighbors , does not exist so clearly .
Fried@@ ri@@ chs@@ hain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which has also in comparison to the rest of the city a low average average of poverty and high poverty .
also hous@@ eb@@ re@@ ments and the new@@ born motor@@ sports projects are already a long time to the j@@ aw : 1990 , numerous homes have been occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost the entire mainstre@@ am street close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the mainstre@@ am had been cle@@ ared in a down@@ right street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by people today they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly suitable for magn@@ ets for tourists and elec@@ toral liner from all over the world : the residents of the G@@ DR are now sharing their p@@ ines .
this is also noticeable with the r@@ ents which have risen since 2009 in new le@@ asing around nearly 60 percent .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one reali@@ zes them into embedded discs or fresh rep@@ lic@@ ted fac@@ ades , which were subj@@ ected to color exploitation .
no other street was mentioned so often this year together with the words &quot; left no@@ vi@@ ome force . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours can see this as problem may be that it is not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences such as body viol@@ ates are according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the off@@ ences make circumstances that ten@@ den@@ cial more built up new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who had been living in an apartment house next to the controversial 94 years , uncertainty cannot be any talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours that don &apos;t have been dest@@ ined for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the famous burning cars put it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
for the studied Archit@@ ect@@ in , its road is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliber@@ ately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße and stayed .
for this reason , it was also so important that the residents of the community reg@@ ain their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the deut@@ ungs@@ ho@@ heit about the district .
but in the eyes of residents like new m@@ our@@ ning , the road will continue to take away : through the spot@@ lessly new@@ buildings in former buildings that supp@@ ress the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately property units which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well known , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone else list@@ ens to one ?
there is a fru@@ stration on all sides of fru@@ stration , even in the police and the residents .
for s@@ lic@@ ted , who fre@@ t himself about ri@@ bb@@ ing , Kerstin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the j@@ aw .
who car@@ es should be aware - just like someone who moves to a pub that can complain about noise .
all people named in names have asked to be called to be called by their real name
Ur@@ bach : Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organization .
in addition , she is the social worker on site .
since July is Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le the refugee camps for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the management of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders : refugees , Arbeitsk@@ reis refugee Help , Administration , authorities and who else fails to work with .
Reg@@ ine customer from the Arbeitsk@@ reis indicates that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is now there , that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is here , the ei@@ er@@ legen@@ de Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which primarily has a problem .
so some - less sp@@ urs rather than on the multitude of desired areas are purpos@@ eful - targeted , when the administration wanted to write the point .
sear@@ ched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long experience in the field of social work , just a ei@@ er@@ legen@@ de Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
yet administrative work is not their central area , &quot; Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
most of all it is about organization , work with the local people , and also behind the scenes and ret@@ t@@ iness .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent focus on a period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that he supports D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le ehr@@ - and full @-@ time actors .
there are large and small problems , organisational , human and understanding problems .
soon new containers are available in the wash@@ road
a gra@@ vely problem is it for some time to find apartments for the joints that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the joints .
you must accom@@ od@@ ate refugees in their own or rented homes .
the cost of building , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself .
the responsibility takes place from the Land@@ rats@@ amt on Comm@@ une and job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration takes no private apartments .
in so far it doesn &apos;t have to rely on private apartments , so deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , the common apartments must be explored , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing street .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a solid bond , training courses , training courses , school trains , A @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ ical work for refugees and migrants have to be re@@ ared or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building or help home @-@ power , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity means not only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people really need to develop a stake .
so , there are offers such as sport , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are r@@ ar .
so we also jump into the administration and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they were wishing and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the process is a problem .
you need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can be us@@ hed at the time , for example with voice @-@ courses .
who will eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone , don &apos;t work and be useless , that will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but problem cases do not exist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people speaking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do both of the most recent pioneers fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do you want to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be nai@@ ve and would like to ex@@ clude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sen@@ sit@@ iti@@ zes whether the hel@@ pers were already .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into dis@@ rec@@ alled .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so , the main - and hon@@ or@@ ary capacity to hold on site and in the region to activities
they always have in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants would come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , they scru@@ pul@@ ling the policy .
actually , it is unfair to place it hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Annika D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also clearly makes that the Ur@@ bacher before already sp@@ elled out to establish the existing human beings .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women are united .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helic@@ op@@ ters
the police helic@@ opter flew around an hour for different areas - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are st@@ aff@@ able on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 p.m. and sent into an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
