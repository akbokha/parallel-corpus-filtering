<seg id="1">Clintons and trumps policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade deal of TTP - they want both the Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidential applicants are involved in tax and energy policy as well as in a foundation request.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep it rather small in a doubt and warns how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to wreak the economy to death and regulated to death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the other hand, it would be quite different, claims Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massif legal regulations, and it is strong for large tax reform with lower controls - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton is saying, the state has determined to fulfil certain duties, he has disadvantaged chances and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the mors will be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost wortright.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes into the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by state-critical tea aparty wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Trump, there could be even cross-party discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build charcoal power plants and restore the coal production in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement is intended to denounce.</seg>
<seg id="20">President Clinton is aiming to expand renewable energies with her investment programme: "a country becomes the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is probably to be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - as well as with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacial trade deal, do both not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, they would not want to isolate US international trade but just want to protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">The should then also be paid better, calls for around Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a familance.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump will do in that question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be down, then he says, he does not need to be altered.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him before, so that budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton is at least demand from the rich, that they will pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and the official end of the eight months long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin warn his Turkish counter-players in the hall of the St. Petersburg Palastes Hall, I cannot concede that Ankara cannot reconcile this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles left vicallied and he barely exposed warmth of, even for its cautious conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, talked to his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day drive a newspaper that Erdogan proved to have heard that it would never be somewhat horrible.</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to see his enthusiasm more about the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin exasant, sustainable coolness showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductions: the fire of a Russian fighter plane on the border with Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's response at this time was devastated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin informed him and accused Ankara, Russia fell in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The leaving was even bigger, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The neveable build up will be difficult if it is not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long the state-controlled media resulted in a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as would the Turks to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The allegations of leading officials were to have benefited their own family from illicit oil trade in areas of Syria, which is controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was just because Putin received the president of Erdogan the Entschuldigung, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire clearly lie on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan, first and foremost, all friends who can get, after having spent the last month at a failed, close to his tense.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey, notably the ban on charter flights, which each year brings several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is reduced by nearly 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are made.</seg>
<seg id="33">You count on a delay in the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week predict the public watch, cheap fruits and vegetables, once the Turkish agriculture will be allowed to be imported.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it has seen the reaction to the tried of power to power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continuing Groll report on the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it to take advantage of the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian state of State won in Ankara with certainty for a bonus that he sought after the sovereign state support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is well for Moscow prosperous a self-comprehension, that even has a deep-sitting fear of regimitation.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this Glanzfull Palace in the Sea gave it to Russia and Turkey, one as it described me a analyst once described, "Allianz of aliens." two countries who feel transported from the West and badly feel badly and can now tally themselves.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently had the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting antagonistic sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be signifying that after almost three hours of initial talk, both Presidents met on the press conference they had not even touched upon this issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey clearly verified to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "there is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey was off the Russian struggle, it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to one another.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin brought unexpected his rod Sergei Ivanov Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years of the closest confidence of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed as special officer for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it says that Putin without stating reasons" "" "dismissal of Ivanovs have been ordered by his duties as chairman of the Russian presidence administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was dedeputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn he was born, he concluded his graduation at the renowned State Department of Moscow International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy of Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is (on Russian) that he later became the leader and the heads of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said about his appointment he said to Putin, "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to alleviate your work as head of state regarding legalists and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and have advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystifying.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest delegates Vladimir Putin and works as he works for Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a leader, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, that aired on television, both men said that the Stef Stef comes back on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the leak for the cameras, here are only a few of them - mostly now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power to be performed?</seg>
<seg id="20">The white is currently no one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once being praised as a potential president at once the Russian environmental policy - came across large scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, says Ivanov. "it is true that I have asked you in early 2012 in an interview, give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complain about four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chair of the Russian presidence for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was deputy prime minister and defense ministers.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin went to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted in most familiar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once was believed that Ivanov could be elected president of Russia as a third presidential term announced against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin has become Prime Minister, before he became president of three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It's amazed to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child to play no longer go outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, screens on screens, has been painted over the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about to pick people up from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games, and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that were created on the characters, which were created first for the video games in the 1990s (later made a cartoon animations, game cards and other spinoffs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena in the popular culture, the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand early July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players move out with their smartphones and look for Pokémons which will be traced with a GPS and once they were found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, shut up with the boat and jumped out for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US the game introduced a considerable rise in increments, which withdraws the "average" person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an App for Apple Watch, distributed to 35.000 users, divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after market launch of the game, the number of successive people exercising each day 30 minutes by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to take" "" "to take 30 minutes" "" "to get involved in the sofa" "" "and" "" "indulge on dove ears, because many public messages are boring and coming from people who look promising." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless the importance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drives sports, reduces its opportunities to climb to cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight loss, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to cause them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful at Pokémon Go is that it takes people to do something outdoors, that they are fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, there are also mollric toys that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it mean?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit could already follow up our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game do.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because of poker's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the Apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, and being able to help many people on hunting, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine doing among the Women's Bush in the gymnastics, and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer pastes since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turers, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren, Laurie, Hernandez, who are inspirational for many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, is round, makes every proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidifies the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female companions has been an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">On the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising olagewinner and the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now, the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the thirteen world cup in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez to be how they anticipated, but masterful Gymastikroutines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday she was the fourth, heterosexual american, who won the event for women at an individual multi-event event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are seeing the top of this sport, but we do not see Turntable throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Lords Five," because the next Olympiad will have only four ships in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainee.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that Turns is a dearer sport and gymnasts maintained primarily into private turnaround who are maintained by parents, who are for training, placement, travel, and hotel costs (for the trainers and their turner and families). the list can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these Turnaround are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the gymnasts receive their overall training and this is a long-term and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, assistant of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both have trained her athletes, since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to fence the communities countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a powerful and easy accessible turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my Turntable of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer free and affordable turbo in Harlem for more than 15,000 urbane youths (especially black and Hispanic) for national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide young high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to get up to the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the wood of the olympic team of Mannschaftsildds and thank you, Fass will motivate her so many young girls with different background to start their way to becoming a healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="8">Heartbeat and stroke are caused by accumulate fatty material in the arteries which form a blows.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the Belag diverts, it can cause a blood pressure that congested the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack, subject to a higher risk of having a further risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the commercial name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clotles more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The executive board of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg thuagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE Health-related Research Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary education, a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse impact on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively during the reduction of further heart attack and stroke are among people who had already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are glad that we are able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from them.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - above all limited the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years. the executive bill recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period.</seg>

<seg id="3">The moderator and voyage Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a Euro-shot, a railing at the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a traction toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the leaded of each object he used a Luminometre to show up and to show us what he will leave.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results in the daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought that has been used to sink the sink of a bow toilette that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally repulsive but in fact they are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing was left, what he was spotted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate his own and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public terrain to stations to stations to dishonoting of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told, "already as a child I was relatively unconcerned what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he got his reputation in any case.</seg>

<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and New categories Niko Vuormaa said: "we wanted to really see the consumer something new.</seg>

<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary, we could provide the consumer of more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who does actually purchase sound-plates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle aged love.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you wander to the commentary box, to sow him under the pseudonym unallformations of men with rust insulations, this statement leads from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplica of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but due to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a plate have been preview for ages 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact the age group of 18-24 is the most likely comergroup.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone characterized by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate couriers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I walk in a busy road in Soho, a humble sight, before I stop, my hands get and somewhat determinants such as: "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart falls fast on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - are still a handful of special record staff.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand up to various men in such stores and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (data qty: eight men aged man) into the Reckless Records (data middle), a woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collectors, question me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This sounded, pictured (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates which he could not afford as they appeared and re-buy articles that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are out of the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things which I probably was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and likes to spend their own time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I drink not much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my push.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, which works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers whom he meets the YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also notices a new wave of people who are influenced by the media group, people who have heard about the comeback and see how to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have managed, people usually have been drafted so as to 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who sold once their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs, to get back their records, "says he.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to followers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record stores provide a soothing community of like-minded community.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took notice of the contrasting payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some pole-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound boards, from objects that invoke the happier exchange of youth.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to look mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flooded a staff of a flat-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record the last month they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% do have a turntable that never use, while 7% of those who purchase a disk, do not own turntable.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I am bladed by a pile to the Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data qty: three men aged middle), has noticed a "trophy" of the Revinival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here especially here and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiar sounding plate so that I can put them into the shelf. "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More products-duty, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no turntable player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older who only get started.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the sills almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I deer.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and women aged man.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned shops, Wild Beasts newester synthesi- and sexachserviced pop instead of experimental jazz, from loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them does not see lonely, but nagging psychregimen are difficult to ascertain when you stand in next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for several minutes and looks at the sows of the plates.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-wool than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">You do not earn much, therefore the collector of sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from one computer or another, but the beauty of records is... "it drives with a deplished sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is truly unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of turntables: urban clothes.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I share the tense, the Jeans-Hotpants to patterns, I watch a group of young teenager, who will be grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter become superior to buy a crosley player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairways, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at her - maybe because she is only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp it.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "turntable"</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money to the industry, and some customers can send to the depths of Soy for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, who is the one that ranks the most for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research was revealed, that the results of YouGov are, let them, at least in record stores in Soho, the great number of female gathers and discos that exist in reality, record juices and Onlinefors.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the strolling through turntables of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while gazing the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year old moderator, holding about the shoulders of unforeseen men aged man.</seg>

<seg id="4">The defeat was failed because of the non-bad drum's price of the silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament where they could swallow New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="9">Just eight years ago, she lost her playing at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This bappe will oversee, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji was marvelous and allowed the attacks GBs out of fun capes.</seg>

<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still pitted.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">The GB introduced basic changes to the half time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half time, until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant intermediate-play of feji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for the UK, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had been running long in favor of the South-consular, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the bleachers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with cancer of the trainer for a stroke of rowing</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no 'gold in gold than those games and that wants to hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rowing machine to the last, 220 hard hieve, which enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if it was only the two who sat at the Ruthsat, there were three votes in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they ended up to the second olagold in two branches without a tax membership, the first women in the history of the British Sports which had such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all you have been unsurped imiter, which is also unmatched.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins, who glide over the surface with the elegance of sponge, which does not reflecting the kind of triumphs.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in a row, a battalion is contributing to the incremental progress that make the difference and there was nobody an assistant than the coaches who would not know if he was diagnosed this day, when he was diagnosed with him cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">How he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had the bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, he spreads throughout.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a quite bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, which held the break to a minimum in case that under such circumstances is the correct term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, therefore I had to go back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 foot, 30 foot, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were lying.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even larger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the inmediality of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve racking morning and tried to process his own anxieties.</seg>
<seg id="21">Stanning, who as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment was in use in Afghanistan, "I was this week an emural wreck. that's perhaps something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">We just repeat, how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no one, therefore a massive thanks to him. he is the best coach of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wished for a better person with the trainee or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race lost during the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not compete with.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even within the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to tap, the panning and glove had a lot in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay abide in the process."</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp already accompanied her whole life: a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher graduation they occupy the feeling of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors.</seg>

<seg id="6">Because singing is the same as a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hacker of the German senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors singers in chorus and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hacke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular coexistence, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures often solve, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint venture had a much higher priority, and it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, they explained.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in elderly people awakens many memories, often linked to positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through litextexte and especially tunes themselves denounces themselves interruptly denied people in long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, the head also requires a particular performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Simultaneously focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singer, which is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone, so do not only practice itself on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive feature is the recognition that one drives through the singing in the choir, thinks of hacsts.</seg>

<seg id="25">To show themselves, if I am for something long, I will better and watchful about me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to begin with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means, little talent to have, betray Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">One does not sings alone - in 50 Zinoes, who hears there if sometimes a sound is going to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says hacke.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing someone from the acquaintances in a seniors, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>

<seg id="33">Many elderly choirs will also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who doesn't have access to the internet can ask family, friends or neighbours around help with the internet.</seg>

<seg id="17">Additionally, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the Department of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the message service provider announced on Thursday its own findings, which by some of the conclusions of Republican Task Force votes.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015 CentCom presented a overly limited process for the creation of arbitration estimations to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest authority in the communittee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Ship, in an opinion known.</seg>

<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported by investigators by the General Assembly of the Pentagon, which were included after complaints from CentCom analyst.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesperson of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment any reports of Congress, while the investigation of the Directorate-General were still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also gave that "experts sometimes have quite a diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of more complex data, and that the Department of Defence and Defence Department can welcome a controversy of the important topics of national defense."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have reported on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion which is meanwhile taken by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence.)</seg>

<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker to stating government officials questioning that contrary to the statements by the government rained against the Raffiners did not have significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional raffes had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">But this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>

<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time in three years with a hockey club (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became a researcher of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as too late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling safe and indifferent, a rapid discord between competition and the quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic folds even would be a burning rod, which will protect from the wristband for swimmer for the turner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch the television, read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop in the queue in the queue at no more than Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the argument between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a woman's black with grows, could well have been made among these known names which would be made available to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-empt-TV commercials, if he would be a swimmer, gymnasts or even Fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampolins for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate every event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised: air pistils, archery, Badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the swimming swimming and may make it long reign.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I may make humble arguments for my particular beloved, let me direct the attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an olympic event since 2000 it was in Sydney its debut, it was hasty for the past 16 years so much that many people, I was questioned, did not know that it is an Olympiasportart at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent Athlete to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had one athlete to the end of 2012 that has made it until the end of the concert.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has some outsiders, partly because it sounds like the unenlightened ear for a clowning school than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am no expert, but only a sublime enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never benent ascending - but also the Grazie of turnaround and diving, the two sports that it combines essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means something like the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, fencing and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They will be judged according to the official Olympiad by execution, degree of difficulty and "flying time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-long athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic Vector is downright.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and dron, sometimes until the finish, sometimes sometimes and back, down and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not only the accordion or the output wall, but also in the TV transmission: the world or the Olympiarekim.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find myself when watching this games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">For this the trampoline offers an atreprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A Pre-Heating movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunt off, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Again there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hurried attack on the target, no wölben in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and angels of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; which of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will shine as part of a afternoon bloc at both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympics, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one, which is likely to be overlooked in general tumor.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the Consciousness Theory can only be reached through the ogling and the objectification of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his air barren, new fancommunity.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long a allies of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters to challenge political changes in Ethiopia, born to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protest during the clashes were killed by police officers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up together?</seg>
<seg id="6">For the last ten years, it was one of the most sturdy countries of Africa, a solid composite of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months, protests against the government were shaken the country and further into more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people crashes thousands of people to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations the answer of the government was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to that policemen were shot and killing all the protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, presumably taken from the last or beginning of this year, such as safety, young people will strike with sticks while these were forced to make a manual against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN-Authority of Human Rights requires now a incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most populous country of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands at the considerable speed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new turn in the capital of Addis Abeba in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">Roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia has continued to be a role model for democracy - human rights organisations constantly referred to the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was diminished, whereby dissidents were effected effectively.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the woes of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that all cover from the ground-use to the worms in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a further criticized election last year the ruling party and its allies the last seat of the opposition, and now they control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this pronged, controversial line in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are feared that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which in recent years have been imposed more or less upon the turbulence and arming themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of the flattery under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first is harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians had been able to communicate through the social media since cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet's services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government lock the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via Internet Proxies that conceal where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them that they were so too protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, and the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amroas prolongated the Amperas, which come from Äthora predominantly Christian stronghold, in politics and business, while they exploited the Oromos, some of whom are Muslims and in lowland countries.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which dominates around 6 percent of the population and the military, in the military, in business and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebellion leader, was to his death on a nonsense of the disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think around the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in them, to perceive early signs of discontentment and to use special officers in order to process opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic" "" "skill" "", "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys the trust of safety services controlled by the Tigray-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time, Ethiopia has experienced such a revolt 2005, after thousands of elections protested that seemingly according to the analysts would seem to deceived by the government and subsequently were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raid, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of unrest was relatively quickly over.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new electoral campaign, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this is not the intensification of the internal misrepresentation of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous form of ethnic shape.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the last month of the protest in Gondar, an amicuous town, by Tigray-conducted businesses and the hatred to the Tigray is increasingly practiced in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests the US and other Western allies can bring into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for emergency flights over the neighbouring regions, even if she was recently disconnected that she closed this base." ""</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West does not want to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break down in a fully volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenlandhaie most often occur in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after a study on board ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and he swims with good a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlandhaie will get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gemmmed the Greenlandhai on the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour he reaches an average of 1.220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes, the five metre long animal expands upon satte 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Yet from this loneliness of life, however, it seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report about the "Science" journal from Greenlandhai, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "awesome" "", "commented Alexander Schicklein from the Max-Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this period of life that means for vertebrates a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Admittedly the evolutionary biologist has long been that Greenlandhaie is becoming ite.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only infallied the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenlandhaie are difficult to observe, eventually they live in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated southwest of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius, they dive at the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">About the lifestyle of Greenlandhaia researchers know correspondingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time-luctose corn them when they encamped six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot still make this haty anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young skirbears.</seg>
<seg id="19">May hunt them sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the icmead and look Kadaver, who are from higher waterlayers to torn down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenlandhaie, the fishermen from 2010 to 2013 in Greenland or Spitsbergen as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was barely 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeters size.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14-method the Linseness of the Haie.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eyelid is emerging already before the birth of the sharks, which in it the proteins are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the linens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1960s, your birth should lie in the atmosphere larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimeters in length, the smallest animal contained the linens on the other hand at carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons-arms, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenlandhaie had a normal carbon-14 magnitude in their linsenrow, which arises as a cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335-14-clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenlandhai an age of 335, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters may be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenlandhai-females can only get offspring if they are longer than four feet, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers had to assign the length of an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">As one of the animals stood with 392 centimeters, probably on the brink of the sex-ripe and his age in 156 years was determined, Greenlandhaie becomes apparent at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this should be the world-record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record overholder, a 211-year old Greenlandwal, in whose bacon at the Nacken was a 120 years old Harpoentip, was trapped from Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Through the low temperatures it is often running on the organism of the animals living in asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature and slow down.</seg>
<seg id="37">To keep warm in cold water, the animals are also often particularly big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal sheds light.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a lesser animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many offspring as possible as possible" "", "explains the evolution of evolution." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailed malware are currently targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware of malware specialists, Malwarebytes amongst 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany were 40 percent of respondents in recent twelve months at least once, partly repeatedly from a attack with blackmailboxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of the companies have already been target of a Ransomware-blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims paid off by the perpetrators of the solutions to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are specialised in presser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to marvels in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially ransom solvent is clearly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a startling fast evolution of the damage software," "" "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most Malwarnings have been prepared to advertise advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then they discovered the perpetrator software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "only private users have the goal, but the change to company attacking was made in the last months startling fast." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, she looks forward for unlong changed files such as Wordcloud, Excel- or database files as well as after filing images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the Ransomware and deletes the originals lasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the press.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims will be money - mostly in the form of CryptoCurrBitcoin - above.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo-database is at stake, with firms about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage falls when a Ransomware suggests.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the German companies reported sales losses incurred by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the business themselves completely, in case of a case people were in life danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany many hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by loss of health acts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we do not say the sacrifices:" "" "you do not fund her to the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, their data will get back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult, in view of stalemate the demand of the perpetrators are repeating.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the security researcher of F-secure the users of users and the contact with the blackmailers are examined and coming to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to assume more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You agree to their sacrifice by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, free online sites, and encode it for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, individuals will redeem to payments of few hundredths of the euro, they need to negotiate partly tough and pay five digits to make their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risolous profits from the Ransomware, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, the security professionals Chester Wisniewski of Antivirus-provider Sophos: "a single person can write a Ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">The most likely it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers are selling their claims software then in the form of a software construction.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware, advice and additional tools have been purchased for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The alerser then seek a further hacker to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one log in one of the forums out in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and tasked another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per remote computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then bear spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey in order to rely on Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanners software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Consequently, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not an adequate threat to successful profitability, the perpetrators are instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This is the potential for damage according to type of data is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators will continue to take entirely new goals on the internet of things in future.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the HackerConference Defcon demonstrate security researchers, as they could get a thermostat control on the internet without their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activating of such a block-based heating so many victims could be a ransom for a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrator then instead of heating in the future to block all the production-road in a factory, Ransomware might also become a topic in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening you are going to be eternally around, at night it is unthinkly awake, in the morning it is already far from the wake-up clashes to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, you are dealing with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep and more than ten per cent, their sleep is often or not recuperate.</seg>
<seg id="5">How voiced your sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>

<seg id="8">Precisely that sleeping, many people find as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, forecouncillor in the German Hausphysician association with practice in Lower-Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of insomations are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychical or behavioral-conditioned factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the disruption of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake-up is mainly at a depression often," "" "says Wealth." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it may be that different factors welling each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a slipped disk, can lie bad, wacht every two to three hours and begins to greet your day-to-day problems and worry, gives us an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">From when should there be a doctor of sleep?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who have not sleeps about a period of one month at least three nights per week and is compromised at the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is downcast, tired, intired, has difficulty paying attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has balances or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the insomeration, it is important to find their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, among other things, behaviors, a cognitive behavioral therapy or even medicines - classical sleep-coated tablets just in exceptions and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">Approved insets in Germany there is hardly, stresses Prof. Ingo Fietze, Director of the interdisciplinary medical center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why you should first turn to your doctor's problems at first, in case of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="24">The can be clarified using studies whether the problems have a bodily cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should be in the laboratory, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">To investigate the laboratory, physicians, for example with snoring with respiratory disorders, in case of illness-effortless, during sleep-drives, or if one does not find the cause of a diplasleep, declares Fiord.</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just do not make a midday sheep," "" "says Fiord." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wiring, one goes to his normal time in bed.</seg>

<seg id="33">How can the problems get a handle?</seg>

<seg id="1">Altbuilt, a few lindenies dreamed, meanwhile with a rest of the headstone feeler: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin Friedrichshain does not affect the first glance, but the police counts her to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks down the road from east to west, one gets to playing places, a refreshing nursery and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the facade of a gray house someone "ugly!" literally!</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished, it is already built: until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new leathers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article on these "trenoon neighbourhood," such as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, will be preferred in recent weeks with combustible cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rented requests, on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially the Berlin entrances had been argued several times for a hard procedure of the police against the project, the area called "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After on 22nd June the rooms on the ground floor that had been cleared together with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks long official statements, according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams cars on site, unlock parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, all renovated construction workers on behalf of the non-known homeowners, the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the 13th of July the Berlin Court of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later went to police and building workers under the jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peaceful: parents go walking with children, sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertained smiling.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are compulsory school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main types of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the area since 1999, and Jana *, who raised here three children are mainly generated by the police.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern from rising Mixed and Gallization.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound after a pase, who wished for a mostly polzealous left against vandalent left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior and the police between the landowners and their neighbors, does not exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which has also in comparison to the rest of the city a low average average of poverty and high poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also housebrements and the newborn motorsports projects are already a long time to the jaw: 1990, numerous homes have been occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire mainstream street close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the mainstream had been cleared in a downright street, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by people today they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly suitable for magnets for tourists and electoral liner from all over the world: the residents of the GDR are now sharing their pines.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable with the rents which have risen since 2009 in new leasing around nearly 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one realizes them into embedded discs or fresh replicted facades, which were subjected to color exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned so often this year together with the words "left noviome force."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours can see this as problem may be that it is not necessarily affected by criminality: criminal offences such as body violates are according to almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the offences make circumstances that tendencial more built up new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who had been living in an apartment house next to the controversial 94 years, uncertainty cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "as for violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours that don't have been destined for." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars put it directly in the Rigaer longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied Architectin, its road is not a crime point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Rigaer Straße and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">For this reason, it was also so important that the residents of the community regain their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the deutungshoheit about the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like new mourning, the road will continue to take away: through the spotlessly newbuildings in former buildings that suppress the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately property units which are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well known," "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can I be absolutely ineffective." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone else listens to one?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is a frustration on all sides of frustration, even in the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">For slicted, who fret himself about ribbing, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who cares should be aware - just like someone who moves to a pub that can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All people named in names have asked to be called to be called by their real name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organization.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition, she is the social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July is Annika Deuschle the refugee camps for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogy supports the management of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, Arbeitskreis refugee Help, Administration, authorities and who else fails to work with.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the Arbeitskreis indicates that Deuschle is now there, that Deuschle is here, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spurs rather than on the multitude of desired areas are purposeful - targeted, when the administration wanted to write the point.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long experience in the field of social work, just a eierlegende Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administrative work is not their central area, "Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all it is about organization, work with the local people, and also behind the scenes and rettiness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent focus on a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer that he supports Deuschle ehr- and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the washroad</seg>
<seg id="17">A gravely problem is it for some time to find apartments for the joints that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the joints.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accomodate refugees in their own or rented homes.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of building, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility takes place from the Landratsamt on Commune and jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration takes no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">In so far it doesn't have to rely on private apartments, so deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, the common apartments must be explored, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing street.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a solid bond, training courses, training courses, school trains, A-euro jobs and helical work for refugees and migrants have to be reared or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building or help home-power, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity means not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People really need to develop a stake.</seg>
<seg id="38">So, there are offers such as sport, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump into the administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they were wishing and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the process is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">You need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can be ushed at the time, for example with voice-courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who will eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anyone, don't work and be useless, that will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but problem cases do not exist," "" "people speaking," "" "people with whom nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do both of the most recent pioneers fear of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine customer very clearly," "" "what do you want to call" "" "what" "" "would be naive and would like to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensititizes whether the helpers were already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into disrecalled.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, the main - and honorary capacity to hold on site and in the region to activities</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants would come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, they scrupulling the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place it helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also clearly makes that the Urbacher before already spelled out to establish the existing human beings.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women are united.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
