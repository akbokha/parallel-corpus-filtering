Obama list@@ ens for Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as in Teh@@ ites to dest@@ abili@@ ze action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , at the meeting the conflict should also be concerned with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ized the continued expansion of Israel and casts a lack of peace in peace process at a top of the peace process .
by the Obama &apos;s deal of deal with the Irish nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated further .
in March , Netanyahu at the invitation of the Republi@@ can in front of the US Congress held a controversial demonstration , partly as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not talking to Obama , a meeting had turned down with regard to the election of the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency , Professor , his girlfriend are shot to have
in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb with a somewhat bl@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers must come to his house .
Lamb was it important to empha@@ size that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited , and he said , the family acts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house they found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handmade note that was on a white block , I wanted to do it , I loved it , I loved it . I was the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb shown in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed up already 300 miles from the school grounds , where he was killed and killed by the police , a popular histori@@ an , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office were shot and killed .
Delta State University Poli@@ mark@@ ers Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ ité staff will enjoy the shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
he said that he had made the fatal emergency call sometime .
until the end of the day there was another death : the lam@@ b took the life , when the police broke him .
one day after the shooting in the university , students and fac@@ ulty to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff , who knew him , helped with a picture of a talented , but maybe difficult to draw a difficult teacher .
and he said that they were rejo@@ iced on his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ ent@@ iss died , he did not have any history of violence or a criminal history .
Schmidt herself mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &apos; wonderful people , with whom he shared his academic life .
both set up in the department of social sciences and history whose university body includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to be problematic .
a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who praised Lamb , he seemed too much excited and ed@@ gy , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes said , that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any other health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for the Lamb that he had worked so hard for him would represent no guarantee for an automatic way to a position as Assistant @-@ Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he kno@@ cked nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions , the Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after the flight out of the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Track , when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as imports .
before it was arrested , he cl@@ ashed with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his par@@ ent@@ on on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ b went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb commen@@ ced in 2009 its work at the university that has about 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he prof@@ iled in the spring of Ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ standing friendship @-@ females , he distinguished him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Cur@@ ston said , she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together by mutual friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach you the guitar .
at the time he was the Lady &apos;s We@@ ar .
all the girls to mol@@ t when he was , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson pre@@ stadt of Bran@@ don .
Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
in the not@@ ary Lamb , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
you had a dog called light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were finished 15 years ago , but friends were stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old now .
&quot; she was totally wre@@ cked on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and was playing blues playing .
Lamb met Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail put two years ago at a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter wrote and sing their own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss has been a nur@@ se , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ ke@@ eper and sometimes under@@ carriage coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak il@@ umin@@ ated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night in the night 5 . September for the last time , once he finished his guitar accordion and harmon@@ ica play@@ ability before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign of that anything un@@ anim@@ ously .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said .
we were at the Au@@ fr@@ aming and j@@ oh@@ amed together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of joke .
Schmidt , the t@@ ote professor , directed the first semester program and specialized in American u@@ cle@@ ans and colonial history , Don All@@ an Mitchell said , a English @-@ professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his Br@@ otherhood and the Stu@@ dents Committee .
on the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ veland on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including do@@ ers , employees , students and members of the municipality attended a cand@@ le representation .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the Univers@@ ität@@ sch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the classes will be taken again on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press site Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans tru@@ ffle to this report .
this story has been corrected to res@@ orting the police right now that the police demanded his call , and that the lam@@ b stands in his emergency , while his wife is referred , but there is no indication of the fact that the two had ever married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ oking on his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theater for the Roy@@ als and I notice that the seat is located next to me and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in my mind that I am a sim@@ ulated plane and a arm length of that I am away with the prin@@ c@@ ess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had four years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ str@@ ati@@ ous the greatest trip movie which was ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN @-@ boss says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Secretary Ban Ki @-@ Moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years to the conflict , and more weapons are wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN Chief once again calls on all parties , including the UN Security Council to unite and to support and integr@@ ative negotiations on the finding of a political solution .
we soon said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the ministers of the General Assembly in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the cir@@ cuits in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make this situation un@@ sol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also called on the five permanent members to deal with the crisis in Syria to show the same solidarity and unity that have proved successful in achieving a nuclear decl@@ ines with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 pol@@ l values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are attemp@@ ting to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper edge for surveys down , it has ( yet ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ dig@@ it area , and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ation of the real estate @-@ Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is too early in the election period .
neither claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts emphas@@ ise that during this period in 2011 , Per@@ r@@ ys management was given to the rising Herman C@@ ain , but none of whom won only a state in the nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he could struggle in a more general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs super PA@@ C and the conservative econom@@ ist Club for Growth acknowledge the m@@ umps of stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only temporary phase :
tr@@ umps sales levels have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump gave its can@@ did@@ acy to its can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , showed a survey of Mon@@ mouth University , indic@@ ating only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
until the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten they say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ voting in I@@ owa established last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would either be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two of 10 say they were &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 per cent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; disp@@ le@@ ased &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if any Bush , the favorite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate would be .
a majority of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans sees m@@ umps on temper@@ ament as problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ized for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have critic@@ ized the right temper@@ ament for a president , such ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first com@@ ic state of the nation , to the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a com@@ mander , according to Quin@@ n@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his office , and almost six out of 10 inde@@ pen@@ dents say that temper@@ ament was not in the White House passe , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if she place her jel@@ ly , Republi@@ can voters no dump for real .
if they are asked who will win the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet .
that &apos;s a change from the time when four out of ten late July added their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est possible cases in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation over only 28 % for the final candidate Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters made a plau@@ sible campaign could be plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ can gathered around a different candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes it almost every one .
some experts suggest that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field will likely be contribution to a pump guidance while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ uses .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September indicates that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the majority .
he has a margin before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points prot@@ ru@@ sion , in front of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , especially Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally by edge Paul , John Ka@@ bel and Chris Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical mind @-@ head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans is saying that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ tor@@ ate will give the dump , say that they will have awarded their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that and no one can truly say , never to change the opinion .
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , tr@@ umps largest competition at the moment of other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters , saying that they have formed their opinion , are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in the issue of immigration .
since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was published two months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; was the immigration hub and ful@@ crum at the public dis@@ course to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump sum will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and imp@@ ly the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey , we say 6 of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans that they agree with Tr@@ ump in issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the spot@@ light remains , it becomes Donald Tr@@ ump that apparently it will do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through its out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l conducted by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government &apos;s experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa just two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated over the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hec@@ tic practice . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive neighborhoods in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
on the road costs a square meter of a roof@@ ed home in 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers are a square meter the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really small .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ living standards , however , one of the price depends on how pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers established a ranking of the most exclusive German residential areas - with rectangular @-@ high high @-@ speed heights .
since times are several ten thousand Euros nix - per square meter , well @-@ noticed .
but well , who can afford it ...
inci@@ dentally , Munich is not at the top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ set thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
doubt Tor@@ sch@@ ning in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller found the FC Bayern den Weg zu einem conden@@ ser 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pir@@ äus - then ran &apos;s .
a sovereig@@ n pre@@ l@@ ude of the Champions League .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have brid@@ ged a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; chair .
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her pre@@ l@@ ude in the Champions League at the Greek record Master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to gar@@ lers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9 ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th birthday in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final in Italy on 28 May 2016 where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received in his 28th place in the Champions League at the Bavaria @-@ guide rec@@ itals of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ri@@ Roberto who made one as an flan@@ ke sp@@ iny g@@ uss of the cosmos .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; had promised home the Captain Philipp L@@ ame in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ akis Sta@@ dion in front of 3@@ 1.6@@ 88 hot @-@ blood@@ ed fans - and the Mün@@ chner talked .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated concept , without sh@@ iny .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his recent six home games in the Royal class , including against known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ ussia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up @-@ Du@@ models were un@@ defeated with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ ageous to be easier with their obvious effort but often to mon@@ ey@@ ed .
the attacks was often accompanied by play @-@ lost on Lin@@ ks@@ ites Douglas Costa , who rarely en@@ du@@ cts the former Braunschweig Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ella@@ ou@@ i .
Müller left greater happiness than his flan@@ k struck out of the right half @-@ box in the left upper to@@ re@@ ck .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ St@@ ürmer Ide@@ ye Brown the Head@@ ball of Poland struck by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct payment , the go@@ alie Roberto with his kne@@ es ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bayern uses her usual domin@@ ating game , he could bet Pi@@ re@@ aus .
at Tor@@ ke@@ e@@ pers , Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ev@@ ing .
so about , when he had a shot by ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te lam@@ b ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New York , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola did a four @-@ place with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after mus@@ cular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ WC @-@ hero was given only after the final training there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ stand Matthias S@@ ammer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that is mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him as he returned to King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Bear@@ ings of Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ z came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 06 ) and about 13 minutes later everything clear , per El@@ f@@ meter , Müller sat down an eye .
before the game it has arrived in the stadium for Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly dr@@ umm@@ ers of Bavaria @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block apparently had prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Piraeus with words and shapes , attacks the security forces and went with percussion to the Mün@@ chner followers .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was inju@@ red from the stadium .
who smok@@ es , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smok@@ es , not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a central @-@ term long @-@ term study .
the good news : at Ver@@ zi@@ cht , the risk is fast .
smok@@ ers have a significantly elevated risk to losing their teeth early .
this has emerged from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smok@@ ers , the risk was to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely to the 2.5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had been observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
root causes of dental c@@ aries , c@@ aries and inflammation of the tooth fl@@ esh@@ y , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ ont@@ itis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between cigar@@ ette and tooth loss therefore goes back to common br@@ ums in smok@@ ers .
not clar@@ ified , however smoking also increases the risk to tooth dec@@ ay .
people who stopped working with smoking may decrease their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard again to the level of non @-@ smok@@ ers , Thomas Diet@@ rich explained Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince humans to convince non @-@ smok@@ ers , the study manager H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lung and vessels and also leads to good dental health as well as the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth om@@ nia , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early gear .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court dispute over the TTIP
the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system on the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration for disputes between companies and states should therefore be dis@@ solved by a transparent system which is in fact much more traditional food in its function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to create a system where citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish has a proposal to launch the proposal as a European negotiating positions in the Free Trade Agreement with the US .
the German government announced assistance .
the TTIP free trade zone of the world will grow to 800 million people with the TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings make sure that the EU states and the US choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to same portions from the EU , the United States and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to raise against verdi@@ ct obj@@ ection .
so far , the procedures agreed among each other to the arbit@@ rators , a obj@@ ection@@ able possibility against their jud@@ g@@ ments it was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long @-@ term , it wants to work for its own details on an international investment course .
this could also be clar@@ ified using any disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration in particular are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ized by oppos@@ es as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , over the company pur@@ charge of tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws and a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act presented the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
critic@@ ised that they are not supposed to apply for the already trad@@ ed trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secret@@ ary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans as a great progress .
the Commission considered important points at the reform of essential points , the Minister for Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers worked out .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government greeted the plans of Malm@@ ström .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ üt during the question of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ üt App@@ ly started at the question of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour leader of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall be his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s first visit and place himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise up shortly after lunch the first of his six pre @-@ given questions , while his performance by the media is likely to be examined and the Labour MPs will be examined nearby .
he called for &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave them colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because it comes after his appointment as a member of the S@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , and following his speech on Tu@@ c @-@ Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of Labour Party has prov@@ oked on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ m@@ ne comm@@ ute to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cr@@ iti@@ que of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs , and stands at the center of several tit@@ els@@ ities in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision to sing not the National hy@@ m@@ ne , has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he could have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respectful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he got the Labour Party to sing the National hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; irrespective of his faith that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of the shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leaders , and they refer to differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a Six@@ th of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t said that political differences lie within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by &apos;s expres@@ sions about the position of the European Union and the limit for the winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the Tu@@ c @-@ Conference that Labour Party lay out to remove the whole idea of a limit in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith said Mr Smith , the shadows and pensions ministers , that the party &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; be that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ to 23,@@ 000 £ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour @-@ chair that David Cameron , since he has been a Th@@ ory boss in the last decade of the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour chairman , who promised a different political approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and had given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the question of the Prime Minister has to be a con@@ front , and that he will ref@@ rain both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; percussion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and struggle with resist@@ or and instead made it serious problems like poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minist@@ ries will represent him if he does not participate - for instance , if Mr. Cameron is on his way abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally thre@@ w the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ co@@ w , the spokes@@ man of the country house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; cas@@ ein @-@ theatre &quot; who often ad@@ mits himself with the question of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he de@@ sto@@ cked that he has failed .
since she was sent first in 1990 on TV , the session has been seen with the Prime Minister as the principal Bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among its parliament@@ arians , although critics argue , she had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would have far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ unds due to acceler@@ ated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has risen up to data that has an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the SA@@ BM@@ iller inj@@ ections .
between May and July the result was carried out without bonuses in the United Kingdom to 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the same period last year .
this percentage was the fastest growing ass@@ essm@@ ents of the time of a interest rate at the time of 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 55@@ 05 and was climb@@ ed up to 21 % over the euro at 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index concluded with an increase of 15 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a leap of 20 % after giving adoption of ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
mul@@ berry shares were taken by encouraging messages from the competition group for lux@@ uries Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ et &apos;s latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China is a key market for Bur@@ berry - again growth .
shares of Gl@@ enc@@ ore climb@@ ed by 5 % , after the mining enterprise said , having taken 2.5 billion at a share price as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the share of packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , and , with a decline by 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his reputation for the company rating .
J@@ D Sports was increased by 3.@@ 1 % after the Sport@@ ing company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will compromise the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more buying power in po@@ ckets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchase power will be the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost might meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PEG@@ IDA @-@ poster expos@@ ures Leb@@ anese to Pot@@ atoes
potatoes or potatoes ?
it is both - and in the potato d@@ eter , which has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Se@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; potato &quot; instead of flo@@ ats &quot; on a poster of PEG@@ IDA movement , Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat was put together on a mark@@ er .
the idea brought him a poster with a PEG@@ IDA demonstration with the wording &quot; potatoes instead of twi@@ sts , &quot; he had seen by chance on television .
since then in his shop turns into a grill plat@@ oon with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multi@@ cultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay .
the idea also has to register the Leb@@ anese with the sponsor@@ ship in Munich in the meantime .
there it has been recently protected by the authority of the authority as a pre @-@ manual .
how much meat and how much potatoes of the Sp@@ ie@@ e contains , Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes more and better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;

met@@ to : met@@ to @-@ level campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash tried to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ alers Met@@ cash has started an area of Boden@@ see campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia to defend some 700 million of the Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centers and first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , met@@ to and Ig@@ A supermarkets , strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ dealer and suppliers are jumping on board , using trademarks like polar manufacturers Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed in Ig@@ A stores specimens and Lad@@ der owner who sell tickets to the South Australian football matches .
it is expected that Met@@ cash released other details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ alers of food , alcohol and tools through its annual Invest@@ ments Inc .
there is much at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 per cent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ Lad@@ en@@ periods make up and higher profits as a met@@ to @-@ flight Ig@@ A network in the Eastern states .
consumer purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after the opening of his first markets , will take away some five percent of the food market in these two states and take away all existing players , but mainly an independent resident sales .
according to a report presented in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A retail@@ er 360 million euros per year and Met@@ cash 250 million will lose $ up to the end of 2016 .
this progn@@ osis is based on accepting that Al@@ di opened 25 stores in the next year 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and achieved annual sales of 500 million $ and 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food production and in the quantities of met@@ &apos;s high fix@@ ation could cost met@@ to € 13 million before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the East states , mainly an Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A purchases are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley acknowled@@ ges that Met@@ ar@@ hs sales in the food and food store by 3.8 per cent in 2016 , will fall by 4.2 percent in 2017 and 2,@@ 1 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share of 14 per cent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
met@@ to refused to respond publicly to the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has recorded contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ A market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 per cent , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ hs Nutrition and food trade , which is approximately 1.@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailers , has since 2012 increased by 43 percent , which reflects the operating reduction of debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins .
the wholes@@ aler w@@ rists , however , and invest@@ s more than 150 million $ , to selling sales prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week at the same and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh foods to provide a better range of private @-@ label food products .
Met@@ ering Chief Executive Leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that price custom@@ iz@@ ations and shop san@@ itation programs to be determined and hopes that the wholes@@ alers will return to an increase in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is being supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis rather deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral mis@@ eries &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; performed by the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ akis , and his opponents , Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee : &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka had to strike the &quot; W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka &quot; and I should propose the child . &quot;
while he was last seen as he had a tennis rac@@ quet , after a struggle was turned into a potential U.S. Open @-@ winning victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ k@@ akis was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ go@@ w , in competition with Sam Groth for the second place at the One @-@ Cup in the Davis Cup @-@ semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing over which I was quite sc@@ ant about , is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was a little over in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly .
he has broken a bat , as it lost because of a cr@@ ack in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he really beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even among the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around , and I believe he has been treated very little by strictly .
he is a very cour@@ ageous 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he doesn &apos;t fit into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is well in shape , he is a very stur@@ dy and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own gains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gios about the important decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the right one for all but he saves the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to go back to a long @-@ term firm part of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is entirely concentrated on the competition and not on all the contro@@ vers@@ y around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has done very fast , wor@@ sen people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes in the eyes of the public , and he deserves some bad mistakes . some time outside the spot@@ light , in which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains the not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and initi@@ alled the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firmly who tried to get illegal into the country . everything with the goal to stop the inf@@ low of migrants .
chaos was followed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and consul@@ ted officials with rebel@@ lion .
the people who had fled from violence , set up for an unknown period in a stri@@ pes on the road between the two control points of the states , and built tents , and sat down there .
but fru@@ stration climb@@ ed .
as a police helic@@ opter about them flo@@ ating , sk@@ andi@@ zed the migrants &apos; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; and rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian prepar@@ ative police .
some was made from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would withdraw from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al harm .
in the coming days discussions will be held with Brussels and other countries , &quot; I@@ vica Histor@@ ic &quot; said in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence at the ung@@ ar@@ isch @-@ Ser@@ bian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy .
the ministers agreed , however , to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people living in the rus@@ hed Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after all - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would include more than 1@@ 20,000 refugees , including some Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an extraordinary summit in the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary put his hopes for full action from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency relief came into two southern regions on Tuesday to get out of the crisis so that they could tigh@@ ten roads and convey@@ ed asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also planned the construction of a st@@ inger dra@@ c@@ ite along its border with Romania , in order to stop the inf@@ low of migrants through the country , after it has finished a fence along the Ser@@ bian border .
C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ races have been used in the competition to create the go@@ co@@ il fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant Eng@@ ot@@ ment for many war migrants from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East into a significant Eng@@ ot@@ ment and the entry into the European Union .
Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has existed for most in@@ coming economic migrants that are in search of a better life , and not war branches , entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which entered into force at midnight , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us , which took the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher det@@ ectors for sentenced to men @-@ skilled dealers .
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the &quot; state &quot; , &quot; said government speaker z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ ac Rep@@ or@@ tern to the southern City Sz@@ eged .
we say it very clearly : illegal border @-@ crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military still , who is expected for next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen very heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities should help 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already penet@@ rated the country more deeply .
they come up by sh@@ aken the fence , they are now in law and are accused of declar@@ ing of criminal off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are with the authorities to fix the fence .
Hungarian officials joined the Tuesday morning also two of the seven bound@@ ary walks with Serbia , after a railway wag@@ gon with sp@@ n wire , in order to close the borders .
chaos conver@@ ts the most important border crossing , near Ros@@ ary , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and thr@@ ust a crowd to im@@ pose themselves there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants st@@ ems the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would have to refuse food and water before they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ t Vor@@ sprung durch Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton still holds a double @-@ dig@@ it lead in the democratic race for the nomin@@ ation at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite to the ground .
Clinton has now had the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the presidential elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is in second place , 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet known as President , he will receive support for 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more perpet@@ ual than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a big edge in women and moder@@ ates , but these prec@@ aps have reduced .
their support in the men has fallen down significantly , and S@@ anders is only returned with 5 points here .
cl@@ one advantage of democratic voters under 50 years of age has been ev@@ apor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has still a big lead in the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton was mainly a double @-@ dig@@ it advantage with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections will say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it would be nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some occurr@@ ences and further 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters in particular are especially impressed by her .
the views are stronger at those who currently not support Clinton - just about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less @-@ Republi@@ can elec@@ tor@@ ate this about their spi@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 % ) .
when Clin@@ tons supporters in an open question asked why they want the candidate to be the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 per cent ) , and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 per cent ) .
of Clin@@ tons bol@@ ts , their connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ ability will also be cited .
since the Vice President Re@@ jects a potential for the president of the President , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for a presidential elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say more than half of that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead .
the be@@ es decided not to nomin@@ ate for the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ cher &apos;s prot@@ ru@@ sion slow@@ ed before S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ ds in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election , but this number has fallen from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; voting &quot; has increased .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , democr@@ at@@ ism call questions about choosing .
as in the last month , there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this voters of the elections as unacceptable .
the Democratic Candi@@ date or potential candidates make good results with some important features for voters of the parliamentary elections .
maj@@ orities are viewing Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trusted and with strong management qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts in the three candidates most at honest@@ y while cl@@ assy strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not have any feedback from him .
democratic voters of the elections are generally seen Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ological in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , some quarter of the democratic voters do not give an opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons use a personal email address and a server will continue to be put in office as an affiliate minist@@ ries , most of the Democratic voters of the elections are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are overall influenced .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans now is disp@@ le@@ ased with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion of this was in March , just after the issue has come to light .
the majority of Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion is still deteri@@ or@@ ating from it .
they are mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 that say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is viewed as honest and trusted , this continues to be a problem for them under Regist@@ ered elec@@ tors . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote keep it not for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote land far also Tr@@ ump than not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will receive good notes at leadership .
of the six tried candidates hit Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush on the best part of honest@@ y .
a majority sees S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son do not have any opinion of him .
the de@@ bug for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the elections will be 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son re@@ moves to Donald Tr@@ ump near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times and Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two candidates the half of support for voters in the new survey fall , and others lose fall dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters will continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , conducted in the Fox News debate last month to 27 % in survey from Tuesday .
anyway , Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son will arrive well in demo@@ graphic groups and over@@ ride the dump of Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio govern@@ or John Ka@@ sich , is struck with Wis@@ cons@@ in govern@@ or Scott Walker , who has deep@@ en more than 10 % support last month at the top of 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ govern@@ or Je@@ b Bush , the former govern@@ or of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are located with 6 % in third place .
the bu@@ g@@ low in the sample dress of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son is increasing in the pol@@ ls - he ends with 19 % support at the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey from ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump on a lot in front of Car@@ son .
having a look at one in the last week asc@@ ending Car@@ son found Tr@@ ump some si@@ eves for the former neurolog@@ ist ir@@ age , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used for making m@@ umps to ask .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump most last Saturday during a campaign in I@@ owa .

even if top values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean sea to be able to present still warm water .
a bath in north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea has shares this week , the German Weather Service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst , DW@@ D ) .

five members of the Br@@ otherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch college Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a schi@@ en@@ ous rituals being a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , m@@ ord@@ ained for five people are filed .
members of New York Bar@@ uch college P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ ship attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an intro@@ duc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and consumed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to its death , divided the police with .
officials spoke , he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack of sand and has been damaged , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g did after finally over head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ der@@ ship ri@@ ef@@ en not the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g f@@ ain@@ ted became and wa@@ ited supp@@ os@@ edly an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms , goo@@ gling , and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Br@@ otherhood , to get advice , said Poli@@ m@@ ef Chris Wagner in a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , Ut@@ ensi@@ on started to hide and placed the well @-@ being of the Br@@ otherhood fundamentally over the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ m@@ ef Wagner .
he could not revi@@ ved , and he died at the next morning of his wo@@ unds .
after a car crash , Den@@ g repeated with bl@@ unt power injury to head , tor@@ so and thig@@ h .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Br@@ otherhood . at least a student dies since 1970 every year at the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an accus@@ ation because of the third of the third grass for the first five members .
two @-@ thirty members of the Br@@ otherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged because of the religious attacks and education of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has been officially sanc@@ tioned - it has been officially sanc@@ tioned , so we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner in a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch college has banned the Br@@ otherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has resi@@ sted its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fork @-@ cave is coming , and the hous@@ eb@@ se will fall into the banks , return to bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know how long will it take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only small instructions on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate , and lasted 86 months .
the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve of maintaining interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement because of a fork engra@@ ving might be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis becomes inev@@ it@@ ably to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the grad@@ ual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still to a lower level , to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a historical trends @-@ based look at how some areas of the economy could react :
as seen in the last month , the dispos@@ able of zinc can make things for a while vol@@ at@@ ile .
once the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may be reflected once again the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank Analy@@ st in a newer study of what happens after Zin@@ ser@@ tia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market is usually during the last 35 years - on the way to fork carriage , fairly flat in the 250 days later ( average earnings of 2.6 % ) , then back to normal pay over the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , the Bob Doll , chef at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares may occur later in the increase cycle and the return result begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but zinc @-@ caves will promote them many times .
in the current case the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product is in the vicinity of its lowest point in a fork @-@ height of the F@@ ed .
according to the German bank in 118 companies since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP had been under 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 amo@@ unted to 3.8 percent , only a few , that this will last will last and expect the third quarter after delivering the rate of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; zinc cav@@ ities in such frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and cast the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken all year on a fork @-@ height of the F@@ ed and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week which ends on Thursday .
while many stock@@ ings and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could raise an increase in this session , the Fut@@ ures trading is just a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increases @-@ cycles of 1950 to the present day have taken place in a Super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and on how to Rec@@ omm@@ ate Rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ists very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
the firm income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , as the market delivering a fork in zinc , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect with bonds can be faster than with shares when they change their strategic direction .
when bonds , the return to shift the direction once the first increase / lo@@ wering is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle the bond mat@@ ures fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the shr@@ inking of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the increase in interest rates will result in the result of switching between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a down@@ feed of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ market bonds often bring better yiel@@ ds , even though &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yiel@@ ds , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ ine at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interest is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expect@@ ancy , there are some indications that the market has been adapted to the prospect of str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the tragic , credit cards have grown up and the vol@@ at@@ ility has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ated its strategy .
in large and medium @-@ sized businesses , businesses that benefit the greater part of their business in the United States , benefit if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive .
multination@@ als with high debts are worse off , as an increase of dollars will make its products on the global market more expensive , and the funding of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares to be extremely positive for three months after initial zinc @-@ caves &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ms Sach@@ s @-@ analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the balance sheet after each of the zinc under@@ mining 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yield as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in its shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average amount of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
company with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most losing , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock games , consumers can also benefit from rising dollars .
savings can be gained by higher yiel@@ ds , although experts from different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Spe@@ aker Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ized the Sender because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corruption &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not discrimin@@ ated by commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also directed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; parliamentary Col@@ lins Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins got the show The Voice on and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary member and increases new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does not do something that does not do business .
the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham said to the BBC Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and is increasingly no more different from its commercial ri@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was also directed at the BBC Music Awards held in December last December .
the BBC Music Awards held last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Vice President pointed the accus@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is a long before its commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and enlighten@@ ment .
what I learn of Radio 3 , I will just do nowhere else about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music playing really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work to get involved the audi@@ ences as it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
but Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the choice of culture , media and sport led by fire to step the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory representative Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice on - the BBC Talent Show at the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer of T@@ alp@@ a media for € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall stressed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Fa@@ ith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced in particular BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wish that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; own stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if there is the next time a entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to ex@@ clude the order of further ranks of The Voice in the Future or to ex@@ pose money of the animation for other subjects .
Internet revenue climb@@ ed in August at the s@@ lower and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
online sales intensified three years ago by the use of mobile phones for sale
experts believe that black Friday has stopped in November the expenditure on Friday
for over a decade , the virtual shopping cart has produced , and many of the major shopping streets in Britain have transformed itself in gh@@ ost history .
but experts say that there are now signs that the online revenues were stag@@ nat@@ ing after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the recordings in 2000 with only five percent increase on the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales retro@@ actively indic@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and going back until 2000 , the course of time has always been developing , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales .
he stated that the online sales were reinforced three years ago as buyer received , with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could purchase online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now we comm@@ utes this and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported from America is cited as a reason for ass@@ ass@@ ing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times disc@@ usses the average number of buyers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers @-@ sites cr@@ acked .
experts believe that black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gain , buyers from them could make shopping .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium discovered out that a total of 5 £ spent a little more than 1 year online .
in some products , such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases can now be executed using Web @-@ shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the inside cities .

officials from A@@ ich / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt took responsibility at Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ leyball @-@ thin@@ ker A@@ ich / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deport@@ ations inter @-@ education .
the def@@ endants are not found guilty .
one of them was indic@@ ted for am@@ t@@ ting use .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ illa Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary examination , that the def@@ endant in 2006 to 2011 mon@@ ies of the club were dur@@ ated by which they used in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage is included with approximately 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sports meals are also indic@@ ted because of financial charges .
this fact stood the chairman of the Sch@@ op@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Jud@@ ge Michaela San@@ in , aus .
it should be negotiated at a later stage .
on the exp@@ elling of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense provided that the association had not emerged from an asset .
the sports sector had only expected red@@ und@@ an@@ cies and the sports club , for which they had been engaged in 1982 and in which they have invested a lot of time and money , from the debts reduction in 2001 around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euros ) .
&quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we conduct the club or lock it right ? , &quot; re@@ marked one of the accused , in the bro@@ cat @-@ agent of the financial market .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have money , our life insurance funds as security during the bank was executed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the association it was agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts or debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the donation of the financial crisis to be approved the pay@@ out of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was decided by 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , one has become a part of the compens@@ ations only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus in the account has been paid .
therefore l@@ ump and not detail ins@@ cription , explained the former ob@@ serving the processes .
the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us managed the two def@@ endants together , the second accused did .
why the withdrawal of the association has not been detailed and asked the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial sector , important be only the school freedom , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the annual figures relating to Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ endorf I began , an amount of 1@@ 20,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
this may have been appropri@@ ations , av@@ owed the accused .
this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
then he said , he did believe that this is the best for the association .
if something had happened to him , no one could win something of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or presented in the room .
the co @-@ l@@ ament@@ ed sei has been informed , legally qualified the functional .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim . &quot;
why damages ? , wanted to know the judge and the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
and explained the first def@@ endant , he had not agree with this formulation because the association was never written any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you all are out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the func@@ tioned , he never referred to a cent content ; he comp@@ uted only kilomet@@ re @-@ money and di@@ ets .
on diet , he put 1,000 euros per month in invoice , the actual effort was however much higher , he added .
accurate documents for the early years failed to def@@ use the def@@ endants .
these are after an in@@ gest@@ ure , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer have been retained , av@@ owed it .
kilomet@@ re @-@ money had also obtained the second habit .
all alleg@@ ations were made in cash , in this way he must drive from his place of residence to the Bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the survey conducted by witnesses .

a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and interest rates at the current level from 0 - 0,25 percent will last .
it is a historical event because it has seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been paid to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may aband@@ on the zero area and launching a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , editorial staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is placed on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook for global circumstances .
she warned the markets to an increase , but the signs point to that chances against such a step are good .

Sag@@ itt@@ arius at the Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later troub@@ led his colleague and k@@ ills - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb gave a note to say that it &apos;s &quot; p@@ ity &quot; by the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it un@@ done , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said , Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and socio @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and he said , he was shot on someone and killed anyone .
Lamb said the staff of the emergency center that police officers must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I scar@@ ed my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , which will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will be bot@@ her@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police demanded his name after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for its shots .
when police broke the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notification of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am so sorry , I could do it revers@@ ed .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
according to writing the notice Lamb of 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he k@@ issed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday night , as polic@@ emen he took him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal president William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said , he kno@@ cked nothing from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb is alle@@ ged@@ ly believed that Pr@@ ent@@ is also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there will be &quot; no information , no evidence of &quot; a &quot; tri@@ ang@@ ular relation . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ is was born by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good human being . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ un@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 and she was destroyed .
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss were his daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss worked online from home , after the statement made by Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss that poss@@ essed a dog called light@@ ning , had been with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb that were ph@@ oned at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ emen it on the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , flo@@ h walking , ran into the woods and kill himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Doc@@ tor@@ ate in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University and his life @-@ Eger at the University &apos;s website .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play for a monthly fre@@ er
Luke Sha@@ w fre@@ ed at the Champions League of Manchester at Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven rather than doubled his right leg .
while this got to cr@@ ying the left &apos;s out@@ def@@ enders and won him out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a rec@@ kl@@ ess attack of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was made in the PS@@ V domain .
he was treated for nine minutes in the field and needed oxygen before he was transferred to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double foam and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it was very difficult and then fantastic playing and then this happens .
in the locker room he had a oxygen mask .
he cri@@ ed .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then lasts for the six months , and he will not be playing in the group .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of a el@@ k meter .
Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mist@@ aken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an elli@@ k@@ meter and a red card were required .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ w@@ h account sounds : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
jump to : Manchester United is incur@@ red by the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat at the PS@@ V
the UK @-@ def@@ enders has an additional incentive in France to recover from the European Championship in France .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break@@ up , as Mexico against Van Ga@@ al Holland has played with the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad violation , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u .
for me it was not possible to look at the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball , who was in a different direction , so that it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be something like this .
I feel very bad in doing so . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken into hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ k by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child can be called , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , created 1971 in @-@ ship &apos;s environmental performance by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult election , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continued : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as it seems always a picture or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the action of the book , instead rec@@ eded the content of the movie version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to bro@@ aden the pretty short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , the heart of Audre@@ y to see the girl of Audre@@ y , filled with her desire to make a real tree , the true name of Theod@@ or Se@@ uss Geis@@ ler was lau@@ gh and the 1991 died , however completely unknown .
as if this would not be suspic@@ i@@ ously enough : the text reads from Cameron is partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Datab@@ ase , where everything is arti@@ f@@ ici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Audre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits himself to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is the action of a book so little familiar . here stops an un@@ named boy , how the local environment through the fire surrounding Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , schn@@ ur@@ ri@@ b@@ ent beings , &quot; that says in the name of the trees , &quot; devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in succ@@ ession to a child .
a down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spre@@ cher@@ in said that the text was probably come from Camer@@ on &apos;s elec@@ toral office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided by Camer@@ ons , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion of England , but it is still hard
while Pakistan has to come to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you selected the Ka@@ der , the UK has chosen for the tour , there is a repet@@ ition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series @-@ defeat was not on my map .
I would not ex@@ clude an aw@@ ful win .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks bookshop is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ off in the batt@@ ing list , and the Community spirit is strong ; they will not bear the s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is designed as a spin @-@ ball and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid itself , even if he is a un@@ familiar size in the test level , is an option for the attack .
here set @-@ up message : Adam Ly@@ th draws from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th would of course be for me than his boss in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks led under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ aker are geared to results .
there was no question mark for Joe Roo@@ t , for example , and this resulted in nomin@@ ation , being - and I said this to - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , he had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of its own destiny .
when he hopefully conver@@ ts further lo@@ ops for Yor@@ k@@ shire , comes another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test head@@ man receives in order to put his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got nine .
just Comp@@ ton got the chance to do and play .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first used Jonathan Tr@@ ott in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th in maximum @-@ form - but this lost opportunity now lies in the past .
alex Hal@@ es comes in and he is a stro@@ p which I restrict .
he is a X @-@ factor ab@@ st@@ ating player from Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he sco@@ red up 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which was a lot of us .
he must get at least the same chances as the before him , but of course , depends on the performance in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea , Mo@@ een to suggest Cook , which would bring an extra @-@ spin @-@ swe@@ ar and four qu@@ icks would be de@@ af , and I don &apos;t have anything against it .
I don &apos;t see why a wh@@ ist@@ man can &apos;t kno@@ ck there and this link stand already showed that he is a devil @-@ shot of cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een may not be done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Just@@ in Lan@@ ger played his first 38 testing at the first drop before it entered into Open@@ er 2001 .
he immediately made some of us immediately , and sw@@ elled not back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach to him he was very impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no big number of backup Sp@@ inn@@ ers who have their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some cl@@ assy supplements in the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ an , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful way into the Setup then .
I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as co@@ aches , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring in the locker room with fresh breeze , even if the messages are in line with the previously set @-@ up .
Coll@@ as team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben Stok@@ es , won &apos;t work with the One Day@@ ers , Roo@@ t received a similar break against Australia and I do not have any problem with it .
some may not agree , but co@@ aches and team@@ players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players will hin@@ ge their jobs from the results .
such decisions will not be made easy @-@ heart@@ ed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diplom@@ ats said that some member states so deeply re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated into different crises , such as the EU is now and not always out of its own debt , Britain &apos;s agenda and distur@@ bing adjustments , which they mostly don &apos;t want to be s@@ ati@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Brigh@@ ton , the Tu@@ c Court decided that it may not be if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they get allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend , who wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; felt us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and makes sure that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s war@@ di@@ ary ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an association , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her like it would be bad for her like th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re@@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a blo@@ oming force .
Poland possibly has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that it should be a bone loss to help the self @-@ British to prevent their energy better for it , Scotland &apos;s leaving the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ at@@ ist tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even ab@@ dic@@ ate any dis@@ counted comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain Re@@ en@@ ti@@ es@@ agne 2017 in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won anything of value from the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how close the Fle@@ et Street can be at their costs and what the EU sc@@ ep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press ar@@ ones , as they were by Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired referendum in 1975 but were not who supported our entry in 1973 with a relationship of 2 : 1 .
you can &apos;t remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who has made a name for itself as a &apos; EU bar@@ ade ban@@ anas &apos; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all his cra@@ zin@@ ess knew Ed Mili@@ band , who were his enemies .
to this end the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ für@@ st @-@ jack@@ ets , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ enden stran@@ gers and the p@@ seudo non @-@ home countries that possess the majority of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought just about it but found that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , one is better ban@@ anas distributed to di@@ stract him instead of being at his lunch and dinner .
in fact the mil@@ itia was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans , as Bl@@ air itself , as he campa@@ ign@@ ed out against the EU , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle about the adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 which opened him a door door .
the press has never heard that too .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster , a friendly cl@@ ap at the back - I told him that he doesn &apos;t spend time more for me - seems to be in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cot@@ t , M@@ alian strategy of the 80 @-@ five years , an error then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC Sofa he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a reform @-@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ent tendency and the wild favor of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ änder@@ ism probably everyone can say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said than the boy sc@@ out in him did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a shadow rap@@ port was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s , when his old father took care in the television for his effort to be il@@ loyal to his labor force , without going too far and lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ary &apos;s fight was still more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among all circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Benn@@ ell &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what J@@ C said its fellow workers and MEPs in their reports on the Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever doesn &apos;t want to im@@ pose the tou@@ chy bottom @-@ up Image by Cor@@ by@@ n - keep in mind that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline stays important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ area of Par@@ ano@@ ia and Ver@@ rat .
it &apos;s right that Cameron cannot give an free map for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the en@@ closures for a matter of fact how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ ungs economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no more just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to the N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son is fel@@ ong convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign for leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors .
why should Paris or Berlin be wast@@ ed political investment - they have also suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be anything meaning@@ less ?
the US is already pretty disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government at power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday by something that British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum was called .
experts critic@@ ise the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
declar@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was born out of a meeting of 12 people , partially with ties for the table industry , they said researchers .
experts who registered in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , The Lanc@@ et , by taking the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) critic@@ ized in her report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; found@@ ational report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have question@@ ed the loading of the data and pointed to the connections between several experts and the table industry .
a editorial article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ary@@ y foundation , &quot; based on the p@@ he his most significant conclusion was founded .
two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; to stone or sand will build . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Immun@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects from p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of rep@@ elling and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ subject decision analysis . ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions about the damage from various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ hal@@ ved products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they told .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting was to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , but not the financing , which he should have received from the Tab@@ ac@@ companies Philip Morris International , add them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body will not be delivered , but these include several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champion , some of which also provide a number of industries in the paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tab@@ disease control .
at the meeting the tab@@ s was also part of p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the damages of most products by most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , no one of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smok@@ ers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that on the claims of BM@@ J already has been re@@ acted .
he said , &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smok@@ ers dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that healthcare risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term impact .
p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what is evidence and what does not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative haz@@ ards in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two b@@ n £ a year .
by clear pres@@ sures of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chief of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broad@@ casting fee will only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ized the BBC that they publicly view public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from Sen@@ ales such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with Channel 4 for six years at his time with BBC 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC has been on job or sends reports that were clearly demonstrated by non @-@ venti@@ onal ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee on behalf of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I receive medium or long term is not for a good idea , one should at least give your production at least on programs that others do not make or order .
you &apos;ll send the Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
Johnson said , &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs which could also be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , both expos@@ ures .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm to this .
I hass@@ le to see me how this should be public @-@ right television .
I don &apos;t think that this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
Johnson , a business builder , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for the hunt for reviews &apos; because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts made by the BBC will give that again what the former HEAD of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ ard lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal schol@@ astic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where they do not meet the public , and they argue for their seem@@ ing sacred missions to justify 4 billion £ circular fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those prevailing programs which no one has seen . &quot;
you put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the tour fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ ressing system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of us think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year here , but for those who is a lot of money for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if it is true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to provide and maintain . &quot;
he said , only little by the BBC production would now be classi@@ fy as a education - he said that it should be 1 % of their TV @-@ production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should follow the public @-@ legal TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . example , please inform and keep it up . &quot;
to the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of on TV will be displayed , and with the commercial broad@@ casts are all available to make all online available .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves
the video shows how the n@@ emat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they are sh@@ ot@@ ted with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bre@@ d wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically altered nervous systems that can be controlled by bre@@ eders of sound @-@ waves .
the tiny n@@ emat@@ o@@ des changes the direction in the moment when they have with sound impul@@ ses , which have to be heard for human hearing to high frequencies in order to be radi@@ ated .
the stim@@ uli work by turning into the mot@@ ions of mot@@ ions @-@ cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und cells .
further informations to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , where ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at Sal@@ k Institute in La Jol@@ la , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day the depths muscle stimulation can be replaced , an invasive procedure which gives electrical impul@@ ses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
fats are usually not responding to ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bu@@ bb@@ les .
the bu@@ bb@@ les , he found out , strengthen the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the enhanced ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und cells work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ions halls and be found in the di@@ ap@@ hr@@ ams of some of the thro@@ ws .
the sound @-@ waves effect the opening of these external co@@ als and activate the cells in which they are assigned , so a report Nature Communications .
to create ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und @-@ controlled n@@ emat@@ o@@ des , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gen@@ etics the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ ions contribute to TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels .
when he uses ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und to the altered creatures , the trans@@ lu@@ cent will be reinforced by the micro@@ waves and transferred into the wor@@ ms , where they turn off the altered mot@@ ions .
the procedure has several simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground @-@ breaking tool , which allows scientists to move and turn off neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ etics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , Ni@@ ed@@ itary @-@ ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und tissues can be ham@@ pered , and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to im@@ pose an@@ zi@@ ous human neur@@ ons temporarily an@@ sus@@ cep@@ tible to the ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the many , long @-@ lasting discomfort regarding others .
most of what I have learned can dist@@ illed into eight simple rules .
the wr@@ ist in Stud@@ enten@@ hom@@ me extends from light @-@ ner@@ able up to absolute sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s int@@ enti@@ cing to r@@ wat@@ ering : people tell where you come from , where and where you have said Sab@@ bat@@ ter , where you are in reference to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither to love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast th@@ l@@ ull h@@ ah@@ aha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Make your questions and show interest .
it lowers the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak even if your eyelashes are in fire and those ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks recipes , film @-@ night venues , and municipal , but they are also places where people are moving and clearing their under@@ wear .
to get related to : do not remember to start your university with a relationship
Int@@ ro@@ ver@@ ted received a grave treatment at the University .
your room should be a refu@@ ge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ culture , which can be friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be the hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes on , but you need to get away the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comp@@ il@@ it@@ ching of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS to kno@@ ck instead .
A@@ prop@@ os anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close through b@@ aking .
since you begin the university at the height of Back Man@@ ie , the monastery is located at the doors of people to imagine them with a plate full of Brow@@ nies , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &apos; welcome in the neighborhood , I have a little b@@ aked out . so , and now please smile , if I ask you a few personal questions .
offer home @-@ made meals is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your fellow @-@ inhabitants feel oblig@@ ated to maintain itself and will be associated to your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends if you are an ever @-@ b@@ aker .
badly mis@@ ed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make that people as@@ le@@ ep if you flush .
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student dormit@@ ories .
of course the cl@@ a@@ ws of chickens is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
review that with the owner &apos;s owner .
the chances are good that they say to yourself even if they cook in the interior .
if anybody is missing , is the annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added their milk a dishwasher , to pun@@ ish di@@ ebe .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , the people from sleep or from work hold off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not just about being a decent human being , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to the people who are sitting in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a girl asked her neigh@@ bor to ask her neighbors , whether it takes them something , Drum &amp; Bass somewhat silent , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded with more important music .
when she finally came up at 5 o &apos;clock , she sent her neighbors to sleep two hours before she allowed her own music and shut her door shut down in her three @-@ hour trial .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to be random@@ ly in the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other way around , it would not be ab@@ y@@ heart@@ ed if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future sp@@ ouses , turn off at them and then experience them everyday and perhaps experience , how they all move together into common friends ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future sp@@ ouses , try at least to talk a little reason .
in the ex@@ iting moment in which you notice that somebody has his key in his not @-@ determined room , is the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer than it seems .
a good ext@@ ar is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
hur@@ ry through plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fail to anybody &apos;s rooms with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
shut her door , and place their keys into a glass of water , which you then put in free@@ zer , but t@@ ack@@ ets off their poss@@ essions on the blan@@ ket no more than twice .
fri@@ ction @-@ houses for refugees , single @-@ moving , di@@ gest
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medium @-@ Frank@@ ish town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for about refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential areas , but just as their own mother and straight @-@ deser@@ ted mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to get cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year old in the interview
thousands of refugees will be pushing to the residential market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepreneurs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living space &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be created : it builds on a project stim@@ ulus for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be pushing to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or Turn@@ h@@ allen there has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
in the face of the refugee camp we need enough space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ ales , three @-@ ign@@ ment @-@ house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a Rei@@ g@@ ator needs least space .
it makes it easier to integrate .
this is different when people puts people in homes .
each of the six houses , which are built precisely in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can be changed easily according to the needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is about 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months has taken the construction .
this is appropriate .
do the str@@ ingent requirements have their plans to be complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : how did I work correctly my project correctly .
this is very complicated always makes it an exhau@@ stive D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ ite Sonder@@ bau and the space @-@ marriage .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be challenged by setting up the app , click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , you will give you the option to download and then install Inst@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have come to problems after the installation because she receives an error that investig@@ ates the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent@@ ing the problem is users recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting apps to create room - but Apple has done this through the inc@@ and@@ ation of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so if you delete a special tool , using apps and then install them again as soon as the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is close to a charger that is charged the battery .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow that the update will continue as the phone may be swit@@ ched down to half way and this could lead to a break @-@ out of the updates .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice grounds and invest@@ s 310@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
moreover , the joint debate of Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ists in Uta S@@ eim @-@ Sch@@ wart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs Major Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
doctors are missing in many places in the country - As@@ endorf against it . fortunately , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on the 1st of October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen was reti@@ ring since her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing with its successor to the next few months .
after a re@@ bound@@ ing phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October until then he will invest 310@@ 000 euros in the premises on the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy with regard to the first glance which Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met , who is currently playing their professional education in the Ver@@ dener Hospital and is also willing to enter into practice .
&quot; we always had the mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when I was when I was simply called it . &quot;
couple Müller liked the idea to continue to operate own practice in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patient are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to meet and meet families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that gar@@ bage bought the house with practice .
living they will continue in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
here , the two @-@ day @-@ father @-@ father Frank Müller was also raised , his Medi@@ z@@ inst@@ udi@@ um in Hanover , followed by the stations in several medical offices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
at the moment he is active as a veter@@ in@@ arian in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed in the circle of Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is committed to volunteer at the DR@@ K @-@ willingness Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen as a veter@@ in@@ arian , his wife has specialized in urine ( inter@@ ni@@ st@@ in ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the gar@@ bage , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a household .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ul@@ tras@@ o@@ und studies as well as long @-@ term and mobile devices and need an intercom anymore .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total subsi@@ dy of 500@@ 00 Euro is getting the gar@@ bage within a support program from the country @-@ circle ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is going to continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the debate of Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 2000 patients come according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll for every quarter in the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen , in the North @-@ East A@@ practice it is about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another home office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice @-@ case by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
who visits an inter@@ vening H@@ er &apos;s talk , also look above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning of the wheels .
with their part@@ ing in Az@@ endorf I ends an era , after all , the physicians have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; re@@ bo@@ red Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen sch@@ mun@@ eration .
a little sad@@ ness swe@@ pt them after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will be sure yet to see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ ni@@ st@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband will be supple@@ mented , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have an 6000 @-@ square plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always been pressed about gardening that this could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ sons and travels via .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls also went up to our southern limit , &quot; said indoor Secretary General Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls at the Hungarian border can remain er@@ ect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application , that can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that it needs distinct signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minist@@ ries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , also not over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia empl@@ ates &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously announced , Slovenia wants to continue travelling for Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany and can also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
quite this was the interior designer Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia must rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the fron@@ tier - primarily on Hungary - intensi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the limit of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Minister stressed , Slov@@ ene did not want to take this limit for refugees but not wear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to follow in the night hours of the Tuesday , in Eastern c@@ roati@@ an at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , in order to escape the registry .
the Croatian police could gra@@ b them in the near Ma@@ is@@ ations .
according to local media ever met with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly around Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also lif@@ ebo@@ at and the Red Cross were already in use .
in the coming days a country with around 4,000 refugees , Minister of Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ bian border which were then transferred to the Hungarian border until Croatia turned into the Hungarian border , reported Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade ranks , however , that it is the people to set up certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we do , nor do we want it , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media report , at least in the morning a first bus arrived with approximately 50 refugees in the Ser@@ bian border town Si@@ d , over the course of the day , other buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ m@@ assen had been on the road all night by the 500 kilomet@@ re distant ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has done , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
as a result , it could actually be due to an observer shift in the recent Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west @-@ western direction .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for limit control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior ministers O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong au@@ stro@@ king of refugees with appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; details called it not , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive options for limit control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has joined the EU partners since 2007 , and since then , the EU partner places a good witness to which concerns the standards of border controls .
on ser@@ b@@ ic side are stuck behind the Hungarian Gren@@ zz@@ aun continue for about 300 refugees .
according to the media report they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ g@@ os , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two fron@@ tier passing Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Ser@@ bian interior ministers N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic attempted to calm Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ et early in Hor@@ g@@ os : it is the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast .
currently it would not be a very high income of refugees .
one cannot tell if they would continue their journey over Hungary , Croatia or another country .
helping betra@@ y migrants to - dangerous - Alternati@@ v@@ rou@@ ten
however , private Hungarian deleg@@ ates have already begun to spread the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border transfer between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still no more spacious mines of min@@ e@@ fields under the end of Croatia .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ e@@ pers was sent in the border region .

hence , this public effective action is good for 20 year @-@ old .
that anyone desire to communicate openly in the tablets would be understandable , but eventually it is a very personal matter .
the issue of death and dying is still wi@@ dened with Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine L@@ ammer , although just the h@@ os@@ pice movement in recent years have contributed much to the fact that people open .

the reduced view comes despite the increases , which are an average of 4,@@ 9 percent and will be effective in 4 January and despite the higher access for bo@@ aters of heavy and large packages which are raised beginning of November .
the company said that it is nonetheless expecting the result from the previous year due to cost @-@ reduction , higher income and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid returns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should consider the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , primarily in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for the holidays were announced a day later than that of the R@@ PS announced , that is considering 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce number@@ ing about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , this ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than last year .
the earnings per share was shown at pos.@@ $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research be@@ asts earlier .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of z@@ ags asked anal@@ ysts expected to be 12,@@ 23 billion $ .
Fed@@ Ex has introduced a decline to international pri@@ or@@ char@@ ds in recent years , which carried out sales in its unit express check@@ out .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales at the bo@@ oming sport rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit describes higher profits due to higher prices , while the result due to higher labour costs in freight business .
in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex @-@ shares at 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , to 15@@ 0,15 $ .
on Tuesday they opened 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11th .
on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen mark two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to up@@ lift the benchmark .
Dro@@ ho@@ end via them at one end of the specified , two @-@ store@@ yed seat of the United States is a wall @-@ picture of the United States .
the map is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will continue to put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double @-@ fold order of Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ failed third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too close to it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to get un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed from the unprecedented @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that they are solid , the recent turbul@@ ences in the global financial markets have already anxi@@ ous , making these vol@@ at@@ ility by lifting the interest rate for Bundes@@ liga - and whether it is only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing she observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ el Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate has not been increase , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough just@@ ification , continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which as@@ sures themselves the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently been reported from Bloomberg c@@ iting , have predicted that week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ k@@ ator , which shows only a 30 % chance at an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the stra@@ ins mit@@ ig@@ ate the impact , by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday sp@@ rang the D@@ ow Jones industrial average value at 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ Politik continues the phrase in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would stand up the sent@@ ences at this time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have to go far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they are not panic in panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that a fork engra@@ ving the financial markets would calm because she would act the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points in this month , the first small step in a slow decline of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ale had said in spring and early summer , that this year despite the complaints of liber@@ als that would require more economic progress , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement of the labour market was solid .
the unemployment rate s@@ ank on 5,@@ 1 % last month , the min since more than seven years and near the level , which sees F@@ ed as full employment .
pay@@ lines have shown signs of a recovery .
and although the inflation was continually passed under the year of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives , said the F@@ ed representatives , that the main reason was the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ om at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world had accum@@ ulated at the end of the month , after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones industrial average growth fell in May by more than 16 % among its peak , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would become the global growth rate .
the market is a little relaxing in this month , with the D@@ ow now situated around 10 % below the place of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ent influence the market turbul@@ ent the complex calculation , when to increase the interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not have occurred , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US membership .
now he pre@@ di@@ ct that she will be waiting for at least a month to get the effects better into the handle .
&quot; there are a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the world economy is col@@ on of the primary concern , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making process .
but in the end of the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was considerable in recent years .
the mere notice of the then conductor Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could cut her mon@@ et@@ rical expansion &quot; &quot; tight &quot; could , sol@@ dered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly familiar with each other , can super@@ vised by the F@@ ed representatives , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the assets of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that have apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
t@@ acker , un@@ anim@@ ate member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a fork in zinc , quot@@ ed decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0,75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognition of the growth in the U.S. , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives were re@@ treating these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the march of cooperation in 2008 , Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to be in the situation in which they fear of a Zin@@ ser@@ cious Empire , because markets were enth@@ r@@ alled , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act does not yet contain a double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think that it should take the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
you have a warm welcome to you , does not work without the engagement of unt@@ am@@ ble assistant .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
and with their 74 sounds they are still being taught .
every Thursday she does it in the asylum seeker at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .

Brasi@@ li@@ ens p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ rische Society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pen@@ di@@ atric organization SP@@ RS is temp@@ ted to qu@@ itting on sho@@ cking female women on how important good nutrition is during the lact@@ ation . she does this with the presentation of paintings of babies , which are of breasts , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies provide all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , a new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ et@@ etic adaptation that mom should be .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet experienced women actually concerned the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet can affect the immune system negative .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried permits the construction fee for the 2.3 million euros . sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the plan@@ ations for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ ber@@ ation of the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ gel@@ holm occur step by step forward : in the recent church council meeting , the construction company was blessed without great discussion .
previously , the Panel among other things had decided on a proposal for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; release by the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &quot; exception &quot; we went to permission for a special form in terms of the roof construction .
therefore , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof has not been er@@ ected with non @-@ co@@ ded First and roof@@ tops . &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern exposure , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger , in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in turn around the pit@@ ch@@ ery which are out of energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - it should be under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore needed , because the development plan regarding the roof is no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ der@@ at tend to be quite restric@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the turn@@ out is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Turn@@ out @-@ building at the Sports Center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from the school and lat@@ itude promotion .
following the next procedure , the application for the 18 x 36 meters will be submitted to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for the 18 x 36 metre hall .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg draws to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital was due to be planned earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be appointed new Doctor at Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees are drawn from@@ P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is seen to see the start@@ ling plans of the hospital GmbH of the district surrounding the Land@@ r@@ ät@@ t Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision on which to come to the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , and the ch@@ ess@@ ation on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are put into action , all of the barely 50 employees would continue to grow at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg .
the vast majority shall move with fishermen and the further existing internal station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are there .
the staff , who can not be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , Zy@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the staff are informed about the plans .
the change triggered the cancellation by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only after the beginning of the beginning of the advent director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and is now moving to a private office in direct proximity of the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when asked about who the follow @-@ up , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the game , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fishermen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the game , who agreed to take over the direction on 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this is in each case a &quot; up@@ grading &apos; and a distribution of the quot@@ ation in the area of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist of cardi@@ grad@@ ual and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner centre of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
in transition to the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the supervis@@ ory board gives the right to guide both houses , until next year the former Hospital of the Kn@@ itting group , which is still supposed to be fully closed in P@@ ei@@ mb@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the county has planned this for 2018 if the current sanctions on the W@@ eil@@ heim Hospital has been closed .
Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , which is also Chairman of the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board , entered the rum@@ ors that the house , which is in possession of the federal state , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that I look on with the property , Zy@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say , there are several reflec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there are a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a meeting rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ es could not happen , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so fishermen over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and comprehensi@@ vely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; received by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a genuine perspective for the house , in which Fischer has been working as a past@@ rac@@ ologist for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened with closure , departments were closed , for example , surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics .
the palms of all the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are today evening ( 20.@@ 3 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ische HC required .

a Tat@@ suspic@@ ious has led the police to the cor@@ pse who have died since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the trial of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and her cor@@ pse cast into a channel in rock@@ ers .
one since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate is fallen victim to an act of violence .
the cor@@ pse of young woman was found on the Tuesday evening in rock@@ enhausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern as a prosec@@ ut@@ or and police on Wednesday morning .
as moder@@ ation , one also goes on the hospital evening of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the fact was according to the statement and the investig@@ ators found the locality of suffering .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missed on Sunday morning after she had arrived home on the eve of a visit in Rock@@ enhausen not as agreed upon at home .
in the quest for the young woman the investig@@ ators put first on personal articles of the victim .
with question@@ ing in the friend and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing ones , finally a Tat@@ j@@ suspic@@ ion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the mut@@ u@@ ci@@ ve perpet@@ r@@ ator led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enhausen , where the cor@@ pse has been found .
the re@@ taken was according to the authorities in the police trial that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the bodies were placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pushed forward on Wednesday to the son @-@ law , the investig@@ ators lay it on the burden .
a resolution on the near@@ er conditions of action will bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns against dormit@@ ory
the location on the German motor@@ cycling market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees trying to seek a pay@@ able bond .
pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution of distribution in the German motor@@ cycling market had long been beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and working seek@@ ers from the EU more and more people push for a market , which is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it compete with income @-@ weak citizens in order to pay the last pay@@ able apartments .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , will need to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this result is a study on behalf of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Housing Community &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
makes 14@@ 0,000 apartments missing .
refugees after the first three months of their stay are no longer obliged than to live asylum seek@@ ers in an initial participation .
many come across the residential market and were divided into the long sn@@ akes in front of the flats .
according to the Statist@@ ical Office , however , there was less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers to rent .
however , the negative development of this conflict is not only to the rising resources of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the construction of the last years .
Germany seemed a residential defic@@ it from year to year that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently , in the metro@@ politan areas already approximately 77@@ 0,000 residential units , by Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals are therefore nec@@ c@@ il@@ at@@ ly in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained no longer in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meter per cap@@ ita has declined in the last few years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &apos; Rel@@ aun@@ ching the &apos; Rel@@ aun@@ ching W@@ rest@@ art &apos; proposes a new start .
in this context , new incentives are to boost the social housing structure once more .
so could be om@@ itted on the under@@ scores and the landed property for subsi@@ dised flats are exposed .
furthermore , according to Alliance attractive tax@@ able shut@@ ters are necessary .
the convey@@ or programme for refugee camps at the Bank of the Bank K@@ f@@ W is already well organized in towns and villages .
a good week after the start the evening with 184 million euros had already been retri@@ eved by more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be repaired .
refugees have free schol@@ ars : Croatia and Slovenia to the cor@@ ridor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , virtually no flow come across , there more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb &apos;s announ@@ cing to allow transit through Slovenia to north with no hur@@ dles .
dangerous is the route but still .
Croatia wants to engage in neighbouring Slovenia with the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian inter@@ iors and if it is necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country is still not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Ser@@ bian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees trying to mig@@ rate to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people were over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian television channel R@@ TL .
Hungary had its debut on the day before its border to refugees .
new laws , which came into force the same day , doing an ordinary asylum @-@ proceeding in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to make refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for that possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
but there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had appro@@ ached the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country .
most of the media had reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
you came back by bus and taxi into the Ser@@ bian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they had tried to get on foot through the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ bian border the refugees still encounter the refugees .
to do this , the thres@@ hing @-@ strip other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Min@@ en@@ räum@@ er now will quickly create a secure level passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary there are hardly any more refugees after closing the border .
on Tuesday the police made the 36@@ 6 per@@ missions .
just before Tor@@ to@@ es on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws are to overcome them and damage the Gren@@ zz@@ a@@ us as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal off@@ ences were introduced in the southeast @-@ Hungarian border of Sz@@ eged .
the condemned pen@@ alties of pen@@ alties for up to five years and exp@@ ul@@ sion from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authorities , we took the new transition to the border with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; total of 94 asylum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers , almost all - 93 - can be found at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applic@@ ant , 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ ka tomorrow there were still 40 refugees left over there .
practical , however , nobody has given a view to granted asylum asylum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an un@@ stable view Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be removed from there .
before the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke we began to bu@@ y@@ ct the work@@ places .
they gathered the tr@@ ash , who left the tens of thousands of people in the past weeks on the road@@ side .
Cor@@ r@@ hei@@ gh@@ s were re@@ constructed and one of the cap@@ ri@@ sts in the border line has been modified .
and to the aim of this ren@@ aming , nobody wanted to express .
Austria reached a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants held up for government information but still in the country .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the trip to Germany .
the passage from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities in the morning .
in neutral opening , several smaller groups of refugees met on foot .

due to Germany on Sunday , however , because of the refugee camp left the railway traffic with Austria were surprisingly enough for them in Wern@@ stein , so Stad@@ ler who immediately provided his help and place the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously we did not even advance the un@@ com@@ promised guests only once , with J@@ break and drinks .
we have stated immediately , we bring it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not take it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this is very happy , &quot; so Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening , on Saturday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train to Pass@@ au , to turn it into a short @-@ term re@@ pro@@ clam@@ ation that the railway traffic was stopped to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train station was issued at the Inn in front of the border in Wern@@ stein .
in Wern@@ stein it is generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ ably altogether - organized by the Union Wern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now fu@@ cking fu@@ ri@@ fu@@ ther to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing sacred policy :
instead of being in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately applied to the erection of structures , our Chancellor , our Federal Chancellor , our German Chancellor , has moved out openly and publicly pointed the position of the Hungarian government to the dun@@ geon of National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sur@@ fact@@ ants in this policy are not only Austrian , which are now faced with cha@@ otic states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must determine that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited and welcomed nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge in the face of the persistent refugee streams and the con@@ vening winter , in order to produce decent situations for prot@@ ector . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even stronger - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,@@ 000 w@@ inter@@ fixed Qu@@ arti@@ eren
Konrad has to do all hands with the refugee @-@ care .
Christian Konrad is it used to believe his word weight has .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ ban@@ ker to provide lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the premi@@ er centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained a grip on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the provision of the 20,000 refugees who come to Austria on Monday was without great tur@@ mo@@ il , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the State Department spoke of a &quot; cr@@ iti@@ ful situation . &quot;
altogether , Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 Qu@@ arti@@ ers in the ha@@ sty year .
to meet the number , must be found in the next weeks remaining 35.@@ 000 homes - 20,000 to provide countries , 15,@@ 000 of the covenant .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he already has discussions with the people of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these would have secured against him , even for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ österreich it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Sch@@ born to be clar@@ ified , how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations sets the asylum Co@@ ordinator also in the OR@@ F @-@ Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ mets like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private people can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
additionally , you have to look at hotels , which are empty in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized yesterday the standards for accommodation as a &quot; very high . &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must have a certain height of the sl@@ ag @-@ cl@@ amping holder or size of the upper contents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a long @-@ term period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Internal Affairs , it is successful in the opinion of the establishment of successful , Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , who cannot be said without further into the face of the un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic not a cost , as it asser@@ ted itself .
their number of employees want to increase it to three to four .
the own lod@@ g@@ ings had not yet been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , no opening of municipal sports sports halls and other buildings such as Tips , Arena and Design Center for keeping refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not at the moment necessary , since one could present the people concerned with no these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emergency purposes , other sites should be tested for their di@@ vel@@ ness .
criticism from the chef on the distribution of the refugees within the state of the country .
other areas must contribute to their contributions here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limits are not sealed off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone line with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) announced the next steps in the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer won me in@@ sured that the German borders are not sealed .
the return of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany will continue to be possible .
however , there will be just the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the prot@@ agon@@ ising would have brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states P@@ ühr@@ s once more increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria leads to its borders again in Austria , is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new ship@@ building of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in der Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT @-@ group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is intended to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT are the clever heads of our raw material - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine to invest in start@@ up @-@ firms of the New ship@@ yard , and later on which to mig@@ rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - in which pre@@ haus@@ er promises a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros of the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is provided by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ress opened second business in the arcade
in the new store Fur@@ la @-@ Hand@@ leb@@ chen are at the center .
actually Jutta wanted to lie a dog rather than a dog .
this project had to get the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad for short @-@ time : finally , she now got the wax in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop compared to the company , in which they sold among other po@@ ckets , suit@@ cases , shoes and greenh@@ ouses of various manufacturers , will now turn everything about d@@ resses g@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allet are from 75 euros .
bigger bags and accessories for up to 500 Euro .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks has been modified .
&quot; but I have long over@@ seen whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says broad .
decisive for the decision was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home from the idea of a personal s@@ iting , on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the se@@ ater in the Gre@@ ater Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has its own Italian roots .
her fashion @-@ interest has moved wide from her mother to the cradle .
I de@@ fi@@ ve me most when something developed and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices .
why so certain women looking at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into ench@@ ant@@ ment , the local woman can not answer with the last security .
perhaps it is because a beautiful pou@@ ch has been used for any style .
the Br@@ ul@@ li@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a location whose inhabitants are called an@@ ders .
this property also connects the US @-@ president with the billi@@ on@@ aire .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for puri@@ fier .
whether it is out@@ law@@ ful , journalists will be concerned or wor@@ sen@@ ing in international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant has launched its strong election campaign for the US presidential election campaign .
and cuts well on it .
this is also noted in the pf@@ alz K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate has desc@@ ended .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is familiar to many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine @-@ road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to him about -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del fil@@ ing a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal , to become the migh@@ ti@@ est man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their k@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter was shot a am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous explo@@ si@@ cs , which in addition to Tr@@ ump also the Ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump that is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &apos; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not put it in place to the king of the hearts .
while I respect the performance of the family , but also ten@@ dering the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; casual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ all@@ ar , den K@@ all@@ stadt im Um@@ kreis , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ ul@@ lj@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - said : the an@@ ders , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ tick is therefore coming from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened to the USA a pub for the Gold Gra@@ ves .
basic of the real estate company were the first property sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ ic@@ ism : their desire to return to the home in duration , failed in the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was then .
he didn &apos;t stop Tr@@ ump because he once was rus@@ hed without permission , the Director of the Institute of Pi@@ pe@@ h History and folk music , Roland Paul , did explain to the film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
it is a contrast to the descendants of the descendants of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to cr@@ ying illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the pol@@ l , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant fu@@ gal m@@ umps ( &quot; The gran@@ ny was a born Tr@@ ump , the grandfather was sal@@ ted Heinz ) .
the win@@ egro@@ wer in the retirement sees the Americans rather distant , &quot; he is always so frustr@@ ating . &quot;
does he believes that Tr@@ ump will come ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pensi@@ ons of Veronika Sch@@ r@@ amm men@@ tions like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit something for the F@@ athers , which came to him generally well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot imagine Donald &apos;s Donald &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t get it better if he does not know the choice because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who were interested in the US at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Sol@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says she . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are also ri@@ pe without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els film , for the Tr@@ ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 kin@@ ks , also in the US awak@@ ens the interest .

Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson shares to Can@@ ber@@ ra , to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but has no major pres@@ ences at the reviews for today .

the ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ator David chef and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ Days , raised in London as part of a week series of international television sets , which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this det@@ ri@@ ment of the resistance seemed to play no role for the Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise identified an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spect@@ ators among the five capitals , in comparison to U@@ 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in comparison to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the last few months , the gap to sunrise is closed .
in August , an average of 3@@ 18,@@ 000 starts in comparison to the 3@@ 30.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 5@@ 0,000 .
until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spect@@ ators to 3@@ 14.@@ 000 with today .
this is the most interesting things happening every morning .
the winds of change relate to this morning more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former S@@ hand@@ held by Pro@@ to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama for a recently rolled father , which con@@ cludes with its two children on the New Zealand coast achieved a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million spect@@ ators .
critics had wonder@@ ed whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca E@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered it with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Fac@@ tor of Seven has remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spect@@ ators and suggested within The block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe sur@@ rendered on average 44@@ 6,000 spect@@ ators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) sp@@ rang on 6@@ 23,@@ 000 spect@@ ators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gui@@ res hot @-@ seat ( 6@@ 13.@@ 000 ) .
on the evening the first half hour obtained from The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 audience and in the second half hour amo@@ unted to 7@@ 20,000 .

the fall on the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Seat will finally be able to en@@ force at 17 : 30 .

the last three ones are in line : Bachelor &apos;s Wood Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
un@@ v@@ eils its secret ? ...
Lana E@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may possibly have un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly obvious who is winning The Bachelor &apos;s .
the wife , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally ends , was wr@@ apped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal who they are the one who has received the last rose .
but when we were with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three are two , you might possibly have given a hint to who the winner will be .
Sam Wood holds its lips @-@ sealed till the final on Thursday
all three women have left themselves in a ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect guy and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values , and positive attitude than reasons for why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you ask who was to receive the final Rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game collector &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast , except for themselves - Mack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had had some relationship with one another from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and noted ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams energies noted that it was quite compatible and I have thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is with both feet on earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with it , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the house visit last week gave her clear that wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now p@@ ending on him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked , whom he should choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor &apos;s Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 pm .

J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent to en@@ quiries according to his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
some co@@ aches would have ban@@ ished for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost a lack , as it did the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by league conver@@ ite on his first P@@ unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 win against Min@@ nes@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Bush Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to prove his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of holding his ro@@ ok@@ ies against the rest of the team by the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula wins Hay@@ ne public in its press conference following the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the teams of special teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ eth to him to forget his ver@@ b mu@@ zzle and take care of the next game .
J@@ arr@@ yd Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t with a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first Game district by Min@@ nes@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ ather@@ hood had to place for his NF@@ L de@@ co@@ d .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and soon told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one just takes care of the next game and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne desp@@ ised the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al segment led to an Tr@@ y @-@ Queensland area .
overall , it was a positive experience for the 27 year @-@ old .

the free voters ask for the high income of refugees , the adjustment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ w@@ anger warned at the beginning of the DM @-@ autumn cl@@ amp in large cities in front of a heavy crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if it is a new teacher for the many new students , &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get promises in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wing @-@ wing of the free voters to Friday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank@@ ish Comm@@ une &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , other main themes were provided .
but the record number of refugees will now also domin@@ ate the Free voters of voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course the issue is applied to the clo@@ ister &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ w@@ anger called for the establishment of UNO @-@ Prot@@ ective @-@ zones for refugees in Syria , as they had during the former Yugoslavia in the nin@@ et@@ een years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it doesn &apos;t go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seeking asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ port the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for the Board of Directors , which are responsible for asylum authority : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new Asyl@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main leader critic@@ ized that several federal states does not consistently be : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are nation@@ wide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nation@@ wide standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern shi@@ fts away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we need to act able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who has escap@@ ed with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; to our trip were many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote .
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants have grown in Europe , many people like my family per@@ ately looking for help .
the donations leads to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global raised donations has to be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million in google.com .

for easily ob@@ ese di@@ ab@@ etics , weight loss can be useful .
the advantages of weight loss exercise for slightly more overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ crow@@ ned people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death information require a long time to demonstrate something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a turns to the new study in J@@ ama Field .
weight loss or obesity surgery , use different methods to dimin@@ ish the mag@@ nit@@ ude of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absor@@ b food .
over the years , Adi@@ pos@@ itas contributed to the treatment of type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes as efficient , but most studies have been conducted with people who are disease ob@@ ese with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , some degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng &apos;s general hospital information , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and stomach up@@ loading - too medical treatments for type @-@ 2 @-@ diabetes for people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I below those who under@@ went this operation declined from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I was for those who received non @-@ surgical treatment treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who subj@@ ected itself to a surgical procedure , are reduced to 36 % the diabetes illness altogether and at 28 % partial .
in the medic@@ ally described group of patients , in comparison to the diabetes , this group is completely reduced by only one percent and in part with only about two percent .
in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also ski@@ pped the patient &apos;s blood levels of ha@@ o@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c to reflect the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept in 7 percent , write the researcher .
after the operation s@@ ank the average her@@ ed@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as is reflected in the improved Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not die mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also gave average results with the two types of surgery .
in fifth year , the B@@ yp@@ ass Surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ omy @-@ group more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 5.1 ) and Hä@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.6 % vs. 2.0 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16,@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine .
in the Swedish study it was by ob@@ ese people who under@@ went to die Adi@@ pos@@ itas surgery , about 29 per cent less likely in the course of 15 years - as compared to a group that sought to be conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage to survival in the surgery , Black@@ stone , it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney illness , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think that we are waiting too long until we take people to take it seriously , &quot; she said .
I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes , which have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
Europe can not be able to take all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East .
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leaders calls on violence to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the long refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visits to his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of West European countries to the refugee crisis is indeed admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama promised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to get out of the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for which Muslim countries can be created , &quot; he said .
in the end , we must think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force never solved these issues , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised to the problem of violence and held George Bus@@ hs to the terrorist attack of 11 September and introduced that the non @-@ violent response of the USA had drawn a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events .
after September 11 I expressed my supp@@ le in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he sat down violence , and it came forth unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fourth @-@ fold increase of in@@ gest@@ ion inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
gyp@@ sies centres in the USA report on almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , the strong alcoholic G@@ ison Center , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue generated by hand@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the Gi@@ ft@@ controlled centres received , from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children always come back to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go back to the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can be lu@@ ci@@ ble , while some do they do to impress their friends or because of MU@@ T@@ PRO@@ BE for social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can only drink because of a cheap experience .
you@@ ths have alle@@ ged@@ ly dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic beverage water mixed to maintain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be sc@@ oured by attractive sc@@ ents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berries , grapes and or@@ ang@@ es which are very pleas@@ ing for children .
hand san@@ iti@@ zer included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with young children can already lead to few spra@@ yers to alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ ab centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you would not let go around whis@@ ky whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come about it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from stra@@ wberry frag@@ rant des@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school was taken into an emergency room .
her blood @-@ non @-@ centr@@ ation was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold , which regarded by an adult legally as dr@@ unk , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , which they treated at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah put her words and was unable to walk when she came to emergency .
doctors deliber@@ ately handed over night into a separate children &apos;s house on signs of deer @-@ trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and having encounter the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has parents and doctors advised to use non @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol @-@ po@@ ison@@ ing , there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
in 2013 two women were killed in Ontario , after the si@@ pping of hand@@ shake @-@ machinery , which contained an toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product meth@@ anol has been conceived , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ anine found as agents .

it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months , we have seen further improvements on the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will be a witness revolution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today except in a late legal intervention , I &apos;ll see how a man is put to death .
if it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a look@@ out gallery in the Death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p will be executed by the Gi@@ ft@@ sman@@ ship .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation already took place in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell all story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists can see in the USA , and there are often more applic@@ ants to be available , finding a mak@@ eup lot@@ tery instead of choosing who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five .
who selected will be chosen , who will observe it emoti@@ onally .
I cannot do this .
I will be sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of close friends with whom I have developed my own relationship in the course of the months with phone numbers and a two @-@ half hours .
I like the guy .
we lau@@ gh many times when we speak .
the prison @-@ authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pin to take up what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of what he wants , and you will receive access .
I describe myself with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she ad@@ mits that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong with what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter was present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ amb@@ assador of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will be sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done .
I don &apos;t want to go down here again in all details .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is in@@ no@@ cent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of act .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of the mor@@ row .
I think there is not enough evidence to justify a death .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter that you can contact for this .
what you will get from me is , what it means to see a man dying a unnecessary death .
man after fire @-@ fir@@ med police @-@ persec@@ uted , from the Cann@@ ing River to come
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale police have remained dry , when he sp@@ ake the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt of a man from Perth to dism@@ iss the police were un@@ successful when he found himself in the sei@@ zed and sw@@ amp@@ ed water , just a few metres from a police station , the tried to get him gentle , to return to shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a home break @-@ in @-@ fall in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water@@ - and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come out and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ hav@@ ec was not too excited about it to make his Uni@@ form wet , so he turned a depend@@ able t@@ actic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
Master @-@ soccer player Ben Cous@@ in offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins brought his car in the dit@@ ch to escape to a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to sp@@ oil out him and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and thre@@ aten the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integer Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day therapy , the last stra@@ w @-@ led at Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tries to do what is best for racing sport and he did not find herself under difficult circumstances when it comes to the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ at tasting with Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had held up 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age for@@ ks and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; see how to sne@@ ak up the grapes . &quot;
&quot; I have just before say nothing to say about it , and I have long been eating , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything gets out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
you know that it continues .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to be raised about my principal and I want my owners to think I try my best for them .
if they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy the Bom@@ b had made the bom@@ b in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integer department had tried to absor@@ b its stable .
&quot; before eigh@@ teen months sat , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they obviously believe that I am a che@@ at .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they are trying to grip for , failed .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , ehem . chairman of the RV@@ L , David Mos@@ die , acting president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should I view the opinion that there will be personally ?
does the RV@@ L celebrate and do people outside practi@@ c@@ ality for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the branch ?
maybe people are thinking out there I am .
maybe they need to take my license and b@@ ulation me , and I have no doubt that what I say to it is now thinking about it .
but I arrived now at the point where I don &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led that he could throw away his license on the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the un@@ trained master Black Caviar , recorded the race tags and sound &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; after a pack mud or sound on the horse t@@ ends was applied to what are viol@@ ated against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has lost mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been like the whole day what was like that .
but it also had so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a 3 @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the racing day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who place these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here you go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy propos@@ ing against ri@@ vals for claims to battle
Melbourne @-@ Storm Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy gave critic@@ isms of his players as &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ento Robinson said that the refer@@ ee of the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ kämp@@ fe &quot; with his team allowed on Friday evening with his team during the high Storm winners in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team , after his team had sco@@ red the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boy on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; mu@@ stered example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland will not be &quot; good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they have concentrated only on their &quot; contact &quot; in the tac@@ kl@@ ed .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers with his team agree to make him confident that they are worried , be@@ aten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emerg@@ es again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about Ring@@ els when she be@@ aten us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that during the whole year we have changed to our faul@@ ty system or techniques right now . but in the past six weeks we have done our contact with tac@@ kles for a real emphasis , and this resulted in us the Tr@@ end@@ revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ento has been there for three years and he has obviously got a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to get acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to losing , it was a bit like a shock for him .
it is funny , as this time again emerg@@ es at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy seemed to be named Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea by &quot; exciting football &quot; and remember his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
he was compared to Saturday evening on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was pressed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of it .
but now he has a team who can play and which we consider it exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
that is the ball game that you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play them .
build stronger faith because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ conut against co@@ w@@ boy .
the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I have not yet seen it , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are Pau@@ sen make and no points a bit cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
when they mention each other , it means that we will be meeting in a phase yet .
the Storm team has released this weekend , since they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boy or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the final evening at the A@@ AMI park . ticket sales starts from next door .
Ser@@ bian with 200,000 $ Deposit to Drug Ad@@ diction
a man , potentially a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment threat@@ ens because of its use , to come into the possession of 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams co@@ ca@@ ine that have been mu@@ ped to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested the last month , after the police police took 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endant at marina in the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where police took 40 k@@ ilo@@ grams of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite an potentially lif@@ esp@@ an sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the cafe would have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travelled to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
at the pris@@ ons he raised the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollar as security jointly offered to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the considerable explanations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ti@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be sufficient to prevent him from des@@ per@@ ately , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was arrested against the deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b Pass , who ad@@ mits itself every day to a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stuttgart : run@@ ners of Tro@@ pic@@ stur@@ m &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west expected
Meteor@@ ology war@@ n in front of storm @-@ ran@@ ge@@ a in the south @-@ west of Mit@@ tw@@ och@@ il@@ afternoon .
due to a deep @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm seas is currently warm se@@ e@@ ft in the country , divided the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vigor@@ ous cru@@ ci@@ ble is the un@@ run@@ ners of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the last days from the Ber@@ m@@ uda Islands across the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to DW@@ D it is still Thursday , also at the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake @-@ seek@@ ers with emb@@ assy of 60 to 90 kilometers .
hence on Friday the sun is shining again .
the mass of it is : every two years the car@@ makers show its novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
2015 above all movement during the compact car , which is currently particularly well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : approximately 28,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations dropped according to Kraft@@ approach ( KBA ) alone in August at this segment .
this is also reflected in the I@@ AA ( ac@@ um@@ days 17th to 27th of September ) .
between all the fut@@ urist@@ ic concept , new high @-@ class and luxury cars will be presented primarily for many new compact models this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German automobile industry is the Opel A@@ stra who will stand for dealers in autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel @-@ boss Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the full @-@ volume model also well sold , the new A@@ stra is not supposed to become much more expensive .
Opel is starting to get an entry below the biggest competitors VW Golf in view , starting at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs about 16 990 .
the A@@ stra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
the Hessen would also offer more diesel and gas@@ oline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 b@@ hp to which also includes three @-@ cy@@ lin@@ ders in the gas@@ oline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there are the Opel A@@ stra initially only as a five @-@ fifth .
as a second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which is already visible on the I@@ AA .
and what will be revealed in addition to the A@@ stra on the I@@ AA to new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his A@@ stra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is available only as a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and a stressed sports GT .
in trade he will come to the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : all new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ Roberts wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
in this process , the compact Infin@@ iti is adapting to its cur@@ ved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a gas@@ oline @-@ engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 PS or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celeb@@ rates its world premiere .

DS 4 : not brand new but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is on the I@@ AA .
outside put the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n bad@@ ener in front of all hand on the front parts : here the cooler grill was newly marked and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment@@ System was moderni@@ zed , reduced the number of buttons with a touch@@ screen and integrated into the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are deser@@ ted
the Bundes@@ ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht has given a former prisoners of the tea @-@ gro@@ omed tea , which was a monthly place to be placed in one at a small cell .
because of the injury of their human dignity , prisoners of det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated into small cells .
this decided by the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a vote on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may have their judge according to their judges , if only a few days they have been locked into tight spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an explosion @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in the German @-@ pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 , in a single plot with approximately five square meters floor space ; the toilet was non @-@ part@@ ition@@ ed .
after that , the man , who , according to his claims , was now restored on an open foot in a larger cell .
his ten@@ se dism@@ ant@@ ling because of the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the land of Berlin indicated .
but the Constitu@@ tional Court led the judgment of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and refused to renew the case there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
Chamber of Appe@@ al is now decided on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons for the requested period only a few days of port days for compensation are crucial , be an unprecedented case , it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a co@@ w@@ ns of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the height of the joint approach .
the Constitu@@ tional Court in the past often have strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners .
thus they spoke in April of an in@@ mate to damages , because it was incar@@ cer@@ ated in a cell .
human @-@ un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 also the multiple configuration of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitu@@ tional Court , who had reached a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decent housing in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dam@@ p Kl@@ äger was over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines over the past few weeks .
prisoners are therefore repeatedly included 23 hours , the aggressi@@ veness rise , even to bat , it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation .
after the information the Just@@ iz@@ press@@ est@@ elle are 21 positions in Te@@ gel because of after@@ no@@ angel not occupied , 19 are scheduled to fall away .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Germany , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in face of the un@@ common challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again , we can do that and we can do that . &quot;
what happens in Germany provides the following overview .
according to different forecasts up to 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Finance ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the pest@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years .
that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 flats ) .
dramatic is the lack of living space but above all in paid le@@ ap@@ t : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments are out of rental rate , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments also refugees .
Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing every year would have to arise and therefore the federal government should invest in the amount of 6.4 billion a year .
the scientists and federal minist@@ ries agree that there must be more tax benefits for investments in housing .
according to estimates by the Institute for Labour market research and occupational research , it is estimated that over long @-@ term 55 percent of the refugee must be recognised in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualification to help them to get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if you find jobs in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the centre @-@ society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ulation researchers Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , it has given a political transition according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt : by the employment of refugees for the recognition of labour .
while earlier there was a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dences that asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the qualified labour force - majority , the perspective prev@@ ails that refugees should be enabled faster to access the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are about a lack of clarity .
until now , there is still no extensive quot@@ ation on universal and based language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore a response by Thr@@ än@@ hardt of the King &apos;s path to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few acc@@ ent parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the cas@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators would greatly increase by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries pu@@ pi@@ l are being prepared without a German knowledge of the welcome of welcome @-@ ke@@ e@@ pers .
but they are not always instruc@@ ted by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage , says implants from the Berlin school administration .
the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
globally , no federal state asylum , or thought @-@ concerning study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ side Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) now has given up its attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learning refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement or tolerance , there will be no more performances according to the asylum authority law , if they begin a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally holds no BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of author@@ ised persons .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for now four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G permitted , from 1 January 2016 , this margin increased to 15 months .
but also this financing of financing must be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins Rel@@ ief for Science , and the German Stud@@ enten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
in future , Islam will continue to play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is more important part of their identity .
the state should hin@@ ts the same rights as if they have the churches , and continue to develop the existing state @-@ of @-@ churches to a new state religions .
important would also be the establishment of an Islamic welfare state , which is profession@@ ally taking care of the ch@@ ain@@ es .
the rights include obligations .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and agree with the state in many areas , and they have certain control .
to this end , it also belongs to the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts can also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted to have such conflicts in Germany , &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on arab@@ o .
integration will be a part of the whole society in future .
in this way the majority of the maj@@ orities must change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since a scar@@ ce decade an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general Equality Act .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ ra showed , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist mot@@ if systematically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and interested parties have already been calling for international agreements like anti@@ racism project prevention in Germany , must be realised in the next few years if the country will remain peaceful and want to use its new citizens - for the benefit of everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , Germany was able to feed the far anticipated refugees medic@@ ally , econom@@ ist Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - Power and capacity concerned , we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must flow extra money into the system .
to avoid t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is demanding all com@@ ers immediately on the registration of health cards .
both achievements could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able , so many people with the limited power catalogue , which the asylum application @-@ law has been exempl@@ ary .
otherwise , physicians to create the doctors before all the language barriers .
already so far , the Berliner scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are inf@@ anti@@ ci@@ dated about their disease as other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctors &quot; cases would have to be taken over by interpre@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a number of refugees would also be helped with more common medical issues in an emergency out@@ patient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with a different diagnostic look .
among refugee information about him there are clearly more lu@@ ke@@ able people , and in young people it is about HIV infection .
with the partial other cases of disease , German doctors made from their training come clear , yet Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; paras@@ it@@ ti@@ fall or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to recognize , &quot; and what is concerned about the resent@@ ment may be even alle@@ vi@@ ated by the refugees .
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , many refugees or even doctors .
in order to practice them , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and may well consider exam@@ inations .
at least half of the refugees in Germany in@@ coming refugees the B@@ und@@ esp@@ psych@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tic ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is psychological : most suffer from a post@@ injury progression or depres@@ sions .
particularly vulnerable , be refugee &apos;s , explained Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study published by the TU Munich is that any fifth Syrian refugee camp will be trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a post@@ injury progression is suff@@ ers from the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , di@@ zz@@ iness and death @-@ cr@@ ates .
further symptoms are sleeping @-@ and concentr@@ ations , strong fri@@ ght , and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill patients receive a Psych@@ otherapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick , asylum @-@ seek@@ ers in the welfare departments can provide a request for a psych@@ otherapy , but the processing generally takes several months .
moreover , in the social offices usually , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness are not trained , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this lead often to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine to live without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; said Stephanie , Tier@@ lehr@@ erin and Jun@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto stands the most recent compound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been testing the cir@@ cus in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
so the gift to delight is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us , it is important to take away people from their day @-@ emergency and take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every sense .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stressed Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte rehear@@ sed .
mis@@ conditions in the attitude of zir@@ cons are just too often subject on various animal rights organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephanie exam@@ inations also takes position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not good to our animals , it is not good for us too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy any string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they have been lov@@ ingly called &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the possibility of every request from the eyes will be read . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal don &apos;t feel at ease , it does not want to be in the man@@ ege .
the first commandment therefore : good for the animals take care of .
especially on her zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is rehear@@ sed .
the two animals have spent eight years in a co@@ ag@@ ege and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo da , &quot; says Brigitte rehear@@ sed .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is still not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus .
this is likely to be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephanie , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with full heart all over it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa , test@@ er guide , desc@@ end up at the beginning of the year on a podium .
he was un@@ wo@@ unded , but the video of the case spread quickly on the soci@@ alistic media .
the opening of the parliament has also deteri@@ or@@ ated by declar@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they have received anonymous deaths and they were warned of the cont@@ acting by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ am .
last month they had sent him out and interrupted it during his speech the nation was given in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of movement for democratic shift ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions @-@ politicians have received SMS messages on their mobil@@ es they warned of Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es of a speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es talk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they war@@ ns the parliamentary group members that end the imm@@ unity in parliament , and once they exp@@ ire the parliament , their parliamentary imm@@ unity are no longer effective .
the boss said , that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; worried &quot; about the danger for the politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will earn up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and spar@@ ing efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will subsequently split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job creation leads to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , stated HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which is to lead the unity after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep port@@ folios of shops that supports companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a stand@@ alone , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be concentrated on the provision of previously un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such an explanation of the company .
it was issued a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by gradu@@ ates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , to restore electr@@ o @-@ plants , and its Pal@@ o Alto garage one named &quot; the birth@@ place of the Sili@@ con Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to cope with the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech company , is the latest in this area that is based on conviction that focused on a better performance .
FC Arsenal / captain Mich@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ m@@ ates stand before the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the ver@@ last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere .
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised against hon@@ ors that it is only September and provided his rehabilitation after plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his involvement in the next summer is certainly un@@ certain .
the great shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le hur@@ ting and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of violation does not threat the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone , which is not good .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his dum@@ plings or with the bre@@ aches that he previously had .
this may be true of purely medical view , but like Less , is also the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of other injury , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ ju@@ ries Ltd had 23 different diseases from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut year six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of sen@@ als 157 Lig@@ as@@ cop@@ ing in the last five seasons .
the wider image of ar@@ sen@@ al is that it has been in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 one of the two Premier League clubs which have recorded most vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil @-@ price , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate during the last season will last .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a random period of time , a time in which you must strengthen your body and gain combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope to stabili@@ ze his body and I am confident that he will do it and he will make a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ sen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ t@@ enh@@ am hot@@ sp@@ ur on the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger poses a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ l@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta can be started .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the equilibrium and give players who need it to give a little clos@@ et , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
although ar@@ sen@@ al is a clear favor@@ ites by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unden@@ i@@ able after 41 playing after the &quot; in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble &quot; campaign was started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday night by an earthquake , whereby the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,2 were measured .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion of ar@@ sen@@ al that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the doctrine of last season with the Champions League of Monaco and remains of the far back , with its management the association led to its first European ap@@ oc@@ al tri@@ umph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked during ar@@ sen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I am long enough in business in order to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy @-@ Show , which was given us serious lessons over men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is evident , particularly in view of how the need for men to open up , now have become more dist@@ ressing than ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men in a 15 @-@ year test@@ icles prove .
in 2013 , it was the most important death of death in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women .
in an effort to face the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ are ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of trying to ask the culture to seek help , when they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ re@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with anti@@ depress@@ ant symptoms realized that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; had doubled its chances on recovery .
for those who are non @-@ depress@@ ants , a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of social media @-@ run communication , with its focus on style on substance , the in@@ viol@@ ability of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life have doubled the need , strong , li@@ fest@@ yles and successful to appear , even if in reality domin@@ ates isolation .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist extr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video player invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality which gli@@ stering through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s big hu@@ gs , moments in the football stri@@ ches , and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely keep in mind , even if they often ref@@ rain down to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a phone staff call it myself : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my audi@@ ences for people who feel de@@ pressed and are mur@@ dered , really clearly showed me how the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel in a position to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I kom@@ m with it rightly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term gest@@ ure mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider out@@ si@@ ders about the phone in moments of despair also may help , the long term assistance comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the celebration of the day , why don &apos;t take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone and sit around , give him a smile and tell you hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the whole 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria hits to PSG PSG Malm@@ ö in Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates ment with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ da Cav@@ ani following his rank against Mal@@ mo@@ e .
di Maria starts at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG off to Malm@@ ö in Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ da Cav@@ ani held course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain offered his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 win against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stages on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League , as PSG player who brought the French masters on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally achieved their lead , as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ ball .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k in group A needed a strong start against the Swedish champion as they seek not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck rounds , but an improvement in the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points it was not a class of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later became later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustrations in 1999 onwards .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or to win in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to gain our oppos@@ ing problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we need to perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , even though I regret that we didn &apos;t have sco@@ red another or two further goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ ć returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend was 2 : 2 un@@ decided on their own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was pronounced at the fourth minute through Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine w@@ rists was referred to as the man who ran through to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass in front of the Malm@@ ö defense before going to Johan Wil@@ and passed beautifully in the long corner of the network .
but if any one believed that PSG would win a great victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , suggested by Cel@@ tic in a play off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nationalities in the field and was opened with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field laying down a heavy opponent .
but besides a thr@@ ust of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , which went far to Kevin Tr@@ p P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead he showed himself sometimes , with some mis@@ chief and bad mis@@ ses , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic who had no less than five sellers alone in the first half , and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had made him after rest@@ art .
nevertheless he pointed out much more si@@ ick when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which turned into a mountain pass by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour &apos;s mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay maker achieved his sixth string , after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had caught a left side of Max@@ well .
this ended up all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before for@@ er@@ guy Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ eide , gave up to that he played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we only played in the Swedish league , who did not have the same level .
the qualification games do not range off . &quot;
hut from ahead of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film @-@ playing
Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said , she will not be needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light under@@ broke the experienced actor Brown , as this stressed the need for alternative perspectives , namely in relation to a black prot@@ agonist in the chosen rotation of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on .
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with instruc@@ ted Un@@ believe and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the act@@ ress of The Mar@@ tian were arrested .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Produ@@ zent@@ enk@@ ol@@ lay Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who@@ ever will be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ te who are be@@ aten decis@@ i@@ vely by her white shake .
the producer of De@@ ar White People was nominated for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for Director @-@ rights to the film ; Dam@@ on tells us that their government could give us something we could not want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded dis@@ endor@@ se over Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter @-@ User Mr Po@@ oni op@@ te his fur@@ y on the clip from that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that is SO KNO@@ WN , that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on comments come at a time when accurate representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen Brown has been killed in 2014 by a white police officers , the movement achieved Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter nation@@ wide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to discrimin@@ ate discrimination against color shades .
in February the singer has made a thr@@ illing show on the movement during the introduction of nomin@@ ate albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still Mat@@ ter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) said .
like books and black life , albums are still their significance .
in recent times leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves have published a statement and a response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hat@@ red group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently we announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , which will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether an invitation has accepted the invitation or has already made the pop@@ e , it is clear .
&apos; American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or &apos; kr@@ ön@@ t First Champion
professional @-@ clim@@ bers and operating system Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
the contest show that had just finished off their 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant who could close all steps of his obstacle course .
during the seasonal , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , till the finals .
the last task belonged to the climbing at a 75 foot long clim@@ ber in 30 seconds .
B@@ ritten ended the task within the time , bringing the first ath@@ l@@ ete to complete the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of the American Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge for three seconds faster , making him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages according to the harsh victory , still under shock over the win of the Great prize of 1 million $ .
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I never even deser@@ ved more than 10,000 $ or for life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile of money .
so far suddenly .. how I can not even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat with The Hollywood re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why B@@ ritten , although he first ended the course , not receiving any prize .
in the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alists , he gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t believe he has swe@@ pt .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
the masses of awards received him from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten from someone then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac was just as felt when they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja W@@ arri@@ or was extended for a period of season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak to Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OLI@@ S@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
earlier they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the final place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , however , in this part , the part performed perfectly against the Min@@ nes@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field .
the T@@ wins has been given a chance to climb in the Houston area of Houston , for the second American League of Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F &apos;s word that was so hard to summar@@ ise over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad p@@ mus .
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ ver Alfredo Simon held its early offensive support , when Detroit was sco@@ red three times in the first two lines , then once in the sixth , and then once in the ninth century .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside , and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start to his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen of any game , and therefore I will go entirely in the game .
the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied tiger @-@ H@@ ings Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has aff@@ led the sh@@ ot@@ ony well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good in the ( stri@@ pped training ) , looked clearly better in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ d@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left part line .
right field of Aaron K@@ icks reached a sn@@ unt , and Simon brought his second ha@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the des@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied ro@@ ok@@ ie shar@@ k Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust a two @-@ run by the right @-@ wing Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen @-@ Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of run@@ ners and the closing @-@ run on the second launched , the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor went to a Double Play .
it was the major League leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe sle@@ w a Double Play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run , created an Insurance Run , created wall of an R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and sco@@ red the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed @-@ handed down , however , at three pitches for its 5th Save .
Detroit benef@@ ited for the pre@@ l@@ ude of the game of a still not moving Phil Hu@@ ghes .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been kn@@ itted before the game by the off@@ set@@ list after he was missing more than one month ago .
&quot; obviously not the beginning , which I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ ghes , &quot; but I felt more confident when I bet and sens@@ ed that I would do some pretty good pitches back in the third inning . &quot;
after received in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game , which created a single &quot; up the Middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single at the right hand , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third of what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers laid down in the second , made a one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fields of Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not go very well , but he has caught the right place .
Mr Hu@@ ghes was found in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , and had no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relief A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ ghes , it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .

the manager of the Munich &apos;s security firm , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the f@@ are@@ well thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he thre@@ w the European states a collective look . &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military participation in Germany has been passing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the conflict is fighting before our door step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Austria controlled in southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian interior designer Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on the Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , and after Hungary there will be no one returned now .
Germany also did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; explained them .
to the question of an agreement , after the Germany could absor@@ b a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there was already a discussion between the Director &apos;s General Administration for Public Security and representatives in Germany .
concrete figures they called not and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
tens of thousands of refugees had come over the so called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann collabor@@ ated with several other EU heads of state and government a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common procedure in the crisis .
the EU &apos;s Interior agreed on Tuesday ( 22 September ) on a special meeting to the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
given the strong refugee crisis in Germany the federal government wants to support the federal states for the first time and the distribution of people .
this covenant , with the countries , Merkel will be announced in the late Tuesday evening after almost four thousand coun@@ ties with the Prime Minister at the lawyer &apos;s office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people , the protection of them , be@@ ho@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but who will not have a dog @-@ eye view could not remain in Germany too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this point of view was dou@@ bles in the round .
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole , now must meet a &quot; huge force . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of thousands of refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz .
in the presence of Stadt@@ prä@@ sident Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , on Wednesday , a previously un@@ named place in the Park on the Opp@@ io Hill is b@@ apti@@ zed on the name of the German Reform@@ ator .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is situated in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was filed by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live over centuries as a minority , often only in sec@@ rec@@ y their faith .
with the place I will realize that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) joined himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as deser@@ ved sinn@@ ers .
his negative impressions are likely to have the di@@ shar@@ ks of the historians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther then had introduced with his th@@ eses against the lo@@ bb@@ ing trade the split@@ ting of the domestic church .
hammer artist invest@@ s three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces of painted in the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and Bible tex@@ tures .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous images .
in the beginning , the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar Old , who in 150 Mot@@ i@@ ven formulated his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes have obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : the respective topics adapted , it can quite be quite dark .
approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective @-@ art selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of &quot; books . &quot;
cycles are cycles , which devote topics like cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , command@@ ments or pat@@ ernity .
in this way , he was spont@@ ane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ publisher with its the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the Bible on the basis of painting with the respective Bible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible selected by Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so into the Today , in recent meetings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like ver@@ bal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible Qu@@ ote from Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulated his whole personal thoughts to the respective situation .
the p@@ endant has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old permits its profound insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately all out of trigger for the Bible : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wern@@ iger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Or@@ den .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the education had already happened with the Rohr@@ floor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded of Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to stop working , maybe for me again with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help art in a fast @-@ life time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is now defined by re@@ cl@@ ams , and which is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is being pushed .
artists have another desire and bl@@ iss things to show .
pictures always have a bit of intelligence and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Ot@@ mar Wilhelm I would like the observer in the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they are influenced , discover and feel the force they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost joined us on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; which always wanted to be &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ end his paintings . &quot;
I have not desp@@ ised to grasp the Bible fully , but that is for him important , also mysterious topics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained simply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was one images of the Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for girls both the ( bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - both paper and linen cards - will be presented at an exhibition for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction starts for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , companies tas@@ ked to model ground for a round trip : a year later almost everything was done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X subway was already finished again .
gath@@ er@@ ings in politics and administration are sor@@ row@@ ed for Ver@@ dr@@ uss , especially for the inhabitants who did not toler@@ ate the rail@@ ways .
the hill was taken from above , looking for new space - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will be in October , the first congreg@@ ation could now communicate with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kinder@@ - und Jugend@@ committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it must then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further reflection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall@@ enb@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga will be presenting a clear sign on the weekend .
the football is re@@ acted to the central situation in Germany and the policy therefore as@@ sures its help in dealing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no one to say , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of every single interest to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensi@@ vely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the next Wednesday at the ch@@ anc@@ ellor and head there the President of the farmer &apos;s wife Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will certainly play a central role in the game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can be and w@@ ool .
but the decisive battle has to put policies .
the German soccer federal government has therefore expanded its refugee &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; 4 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun company , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared K@@ id@@ ol@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even some Bundes@@ liga are supporting this program .
already this weekend the 36 Profi@@ ver@@ eine is a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot@@ he@@ mel instead of usual usual sponsor@@ ship @-@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everybody should help , where and as they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and drew the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ creation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee is drama every day , nobody should be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can hold football world , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredible , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
Hoff@@ enh@@ ei@@ ms Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
at the EM &apos;s qualifying game on Hungary at this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Saale .
K@@ id@@ s@@ bach supported the support of refugees as a &quot; large community work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 Roy@@ als had started in their places own projects , be great .
just as great is that small and smallest associations are still active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent is spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and next year the association agreement with the DF@@ B choice and the federal government will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ uch@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP resistance generation loses in an eye with an accident
the head office of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill M@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has finally lost several reports by a fall in the beginning of July the left eye .
during the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the US he was deb@@ ated to a water @-@ o@@ fier , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was impot@@ ent , then out to be out to the street - he tells us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t might end his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October we meet in Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 54 year old managers were at the meeting and &quot; fully working @-@ fit . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will return to Germany in October and continue to share the software packages .
&quot; I am full of SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in a regular contact with the Super@@ vis@@ ory Board and its leader Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; SZ &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes , usually between Germany and the US , but since summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each can happen as something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to be up again , if you like . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except for sk@@ ir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ te An unusual picture and explained , he did the injury inher@@ it when he was over@@ thrown by the bike .
he therefore comes in Singapore at the weekend as a reserve for the two St@@ am@@ mp@@ il@@ oten Fernando Al@@ onso and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without re@@ us to Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussia Dortmund , all hopes on a com@@ eback of Marco re@@ us will finally cr@@ ush in the first group game of the Europa League .
the nation @-@ player will also be missing the leader of the football @-@ Bundes@@ liga also in the Du@@ ell with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot draw on him back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ ic against Leverkusen , the BV@@ B Coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his trunk @-@ eleven on the re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ eper .
therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place by b@@ art@@ enders Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football instructor the world champion .
whether past@@ oring will be used in all Europe @-@ league games , no f@@ enn@@ ae found however open .
with a high probability , he will also ride the second game .
the for@@ ged statement from fellow players re@@ us that the Fin@@ anci@@ one for the BV@@ B in the European league holds the target , holds Mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian w@@ eig@@ l for trac@@ eable : &quot; so , Marco does not lie so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to lead the lead in Germany
Germany should be the un@@ ner of the will of the Federal Government upon the change of the cars of technological developments .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a Strateg@@ ic Committee from the Haus von Transport Minister Alexander Dobr@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which among other investments can be found in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dobr@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Mobil@@ card &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; automated driving and connected driving will increase the traffic safety and ensure less stress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which will also come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
among other things , the Strateg@@ ic Department of Commerce empha@@ sizes inter alia the importance of the mobile broad@@ band installation and a breeding branch of digital radio .
the testing of new technology is currently a test ride on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude that the driver will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional dis@@ claimer will &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to examine the legal framework , and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus Germany wants to employ around internationally for the permitted total @-@ speed limit for self @-@ driving cars of 10 to 130 km @-@ kilometer .
the Federal Government also wants to commit itself to a change in the Vienna Convention , which has only been shown to humans as a driver .
when the automated driving takes over , the car takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that collect the environment and process the data in secondary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after one from the Economic Department of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be possible on motor@@ ways up to 2020 technically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , un@@ il@@ ess cars on public roads be expected only far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany assess the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the KW@@ s can lead to greater safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of drivers have clearly clar@@ ified , but clearly clar@@ ified .
even the German self @-@ driving cars were sc@@ ep@@ tical - much more than the French or the Americans .
one on Wednesday at the AA prec@@ in@@ ee conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the exam@@ inations Dec@@ ra comes to the outcome , that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonom@@ ous cars will be en@@ force over the next ten years ; 32 percent do not reck@@ on at least 20 years now , 31 percent do not believe in it .
in France 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed were about 20@@ 25 with self @-@ sufficient vehicles , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after an acquisition of the digital hi@@ coma , Bit@@ kom would only agree to only seven percent , take control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the fre@@ eway , that could be expected to be approximately 15 per cent in the flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent .
well every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at Tis@@ cht@@ ennis @-@ EM
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will be aiming for jet@@ ty status in front of September 25 until October 4 only in@@ sol@@ ation .
the final decision will be made latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo on the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ tour in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oll under@@ took this time on the flight to a long @-@ term tax @-@ term in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo this is the down@@ side , we are no longer like a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated flyer Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ ri@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who carries the s@@ etz@@ ings in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ ed@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , Timo himself was missing , and we have become a European master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the puppy @-@ fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football nation of Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn a heavy injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven , the def@@ ender was met with a tac@@ kl@@ ed of Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and after a long treatment .
the first diagnosis was made up of the 20 year old fellow @-@ players from Bast@@ ian por@@ ters to a sli@@ pp@@ board .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a combination of very big mo@@ den@@ schau and a w@@ ax@@ le @-@ gr@@ in tray : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : DIS@@ PU@@ PP@@ EN , which thanks to video proj@@ ections both start@@ ling .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French design , which was among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as Büh@@ nen@@ out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and with it that he hid men in the tube .
&quot; I can no longer tell today that I am the En@@ f@@ ant H@@ Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was very easy , in the meantime it &apos;s really , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om &apos;s side@@ walk on the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the mo@@ des@@ erts had changed his first @-@ story attitude to a vision of his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was about it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me played an exhibition a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal , Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful d@@ resses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger The@@ deren .
it involves tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s not @-@ looking work of man , who wrote the fashion history without ever having completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork , designed for the much effort : to frozen the d@@ olls , became an sty@@ list for example .
14 tons of stuff made the movers according to data of the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the Okto@@ ber@@ fest was a special m@@ oo@@ dle with it : a leather tro@@ users Out@@ fit with cor@@ set@@ t .
Heidi meets Madonna .
he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sl@@ ender as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy is in the exhibition to see .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ repar@@ ations of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy Bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
playing with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not allow him .
he then removed the design of fashion then himself .
he removed fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought these things naturally .
he has not able to pay the model for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing but dur@@ ated but the cl@@ ots still hold .
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as fashion @-@ niche
formerly it went to the long stick@@ ers in and around pl@@ ust about to make a meter .
the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tops were produced in great amount for customers , for example pro@@ sp@@ ings them to blan@@ kets and sheer curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the mo@@ g@@ ale Pl@@ auen .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion plays a major role , then it was squee@@ zed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
clean hardt is calling for some examples : tip in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and in regional Tra@@ chten .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ mode , which bor@@ row@@ ed itself to trekking , increases an acceler@@ ation level .
who@@ ever serves no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
they already have half of all orders from us already .
Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ auen is a member of nine further companies in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must carry the protected label .
in the last 15 years around 80 percent of the sales were cut off .
private agencies and the wholes@@ ale area is almost no longer there .
our products can barely even reach our customers in this way .
the mass ware of these days in the Asian region is produced much cheaper and almost exclusively sold over chains .
it is also weak@@ ened in export , up to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the branch association also tries to score with environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ a designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eberger Foreign university Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and injection .
in order to appeal to a bit from the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas from designer and the factories that must think in particular economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , the textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ designed the historical snow @-@ tip .
then sends the machine to some places small kitchen .
the plumbing was inspired in the Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ lin of it : &quot; before I was able to do nothing with the traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Point . &quot;
now they used the snow @-@ tip for their jewelry .
in an elaborate process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors had lived in pl@@ orable and surroundings and who want to be a reminder .
in this way I see my jewellery as a modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plan new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends you should not touch , but Disney is still afraid of a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however it is noisy &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however not a new extension , but a kind of continuation , which will play for the first film with the magical child ids after the first film .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny family &apos;s experience in times of the global economic crisis in England .
who plays W@@ opp@@ in over 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already fixed : Rob Marshall , last recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pushed forward to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi &apos;an on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the governance of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should apply to improve foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies needed for business operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech in the 16th session of the Central Command group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote re @-@ ups and drive reforms , new momentum and vitality will bring about and rein@@ vigor@@ ate new space for economic growth , &quot; Xi &apos;an .
the leadership team has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative shift to the settlement of the market process , relaxation of border controls policy , promoting state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , priv@@ ates capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the residents of Mel@@ od@@ ystems .
according to the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified for investments do not come into question .
the system is gradually tested and improved through testing programs .
the initiative is of importance because it demonstrates the market a greater role in the division of resources , a law of state business environment and the market open to an open , said the Statement .
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on companies &apos; powers and make sure that companies decide how to manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of border co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the scope of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas will open for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; permit , facilit@@ ating the requirements and the application process will be facilit@@ ated .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and advocate a professional judge and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides such as Li@@ u Yun@@ nan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as were reported in one after the statement published .
EU wants to double @-@ the mer@@ cury in be@@ asts
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large rob@@ ber@@ y fish and the consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve cells .
the consumer organization Food@@ watch , which has an appe@@ aling work of the EU , critic@@ ized the plans shar@@ ply : &quot; risks and side effects of f@@ law@@ ful industrial and environmental policies are handled with full weight on pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , according to the limit values of the nerve @-@ toxic for large fish at the end of the food chain like shar@@ k or shar@@ k on &quot; economic reasons &quot; raised by one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury , depending on the kil@@ ogra@@ m of fish .
large rob@@ bers are still so strongly charged with mer@@ cury , that some 50 per cent of the beginnings are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limits of the thres@@ hold , then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be negoti@@ able .
in return for this cur@@ se the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values at other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0,1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogra@@ m .
Food@@ watch has referred to as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cemet@@ eries , like car@@ ps , are usually so low st@@ ressing that they have already received the planned high@@ s already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ab@@ sen@@ ing with Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one per@@ fi@@ des Ab@@ lation Cath@@ ver that helps only the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
