this document is a summary of the European Public Government reports ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which studies is assessed as the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ end@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need further information on your disease or its treatment , please read the package management ( also part of E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist .
if you require further information on the basis of recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Re@@ res thinking and Spe@@ ech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ usions . • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological disorder in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal Hoch@@ stimmung ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate @-@ heavy and severe episodes and to prevent@@ ative man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is applied to the rapid control of disturbed un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the or@@ ale in@@ gest@@ ion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to inv@@ ade or the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in patients may be applied to those the ab@@ cks of tablets .
in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are just like abili@@ fy , should be adjusted the dose of abili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ en@@ z@@ ol probably works primarily as a &quot; part Ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ac@@ ol like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters works to activate the recept@@ ors .
da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine plays a role in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder , contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing mental or man@@ ic symptoms and will prevent its re @-@ emergence .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy the re @-@ emergence of symptoms , has been studied in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution was compared to two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or similar conditions , which compared to a decreased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in a further study ab@@ norm@@ fy about twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , in another study the effectiveness of abili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo employed to avoid re @-@ occur in 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy injection solution was compared to a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered on stric@@ ter un@@ rest , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the change of the patient &apos;s symptoms were investigated according to a standard sc@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body has the mel@@ ting tablets and the solution to inv@@ res@@ or@@ ated ( decre@@ ases ) .
in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution , patients who were abili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms experienced un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder decreased abili@@ fy in four of the five short term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than plac@@ ebo the re@@ occur Man@@ ic episodes in previously presented patients and if it was additionally administ@@ ered to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms experienced un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side @-@ effects of abili@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ am@@ id@@ ale disorders ( un@@ locking ) , hy@@ bri@@ ghtness ( anxiety ) , fatigue , nau@@ sea ( const@@ ip@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ lessness , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia , ins@@ om@@ nia ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ans ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and from moderate to severe episodes in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes held on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol , compared to the risks .
moreover , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution in patients with schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder , if a or@@ ale therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks .
June 2004 the European Commission granted to the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of abili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and indicated for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended initial dose for abili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at an accounting period of 15 mg / day and daily , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness at dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although single patients could benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended initial dose for abili@@ fy amounts 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients under 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ates should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ electr@@ o is set off from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ anz@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after a change of anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increase in fault risk with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
Ari@@ pi@@ fo@@ z@@ ol should be applied with caution in patients with known Car@@ di@@ ovascular Diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dio , hy@@ po@@ id disease , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ en@@ ched and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical trials , which a year or less digest@@ ed , there were occasi@@ onal reports of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol .
if in case of a @-@ abili@@ fy patients , signs and symptoms of a sp@@ et@@ dy@@ sk@@ esia occur , should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient could sign signs and symptoms that indicate to a m@@ ns or un@@ clear high fe@@ ver without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines must be ab@@ usi@@ fy , including abili@@ fy .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol should be used in patients with scr@@ am@@ against accidents in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at resi@@ du@@ es , which are used with caution .
56 - 99 years of associated with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol in patients with Psych@@ osis patients were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zene , an increased ster@@ ile , compared to the plac@@ ebo .
there were however in one of these studies , a study involving fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the starter for unwanted cerem@@ onial events with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ azi@@ di or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy .
there is no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents actually treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , Poly@@ uri@@ a , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deteri@@ oration of gl@@ uc@@ ose levels .
a weight gain is generally found in schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients and in patients infected with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , where weight is widely known as side @-@ effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and may lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ al@@ z@@ ol to the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ach@@ ol in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines has been taken in combination with ru@@ bb@@ ing side effects such as sea @-@ enco@@ ding ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist of Fam@@ ot@@ id in , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol , however this effect is not relevant as a clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy subjects , a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ ine ) took the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol to 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected to have other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ oxet@@ ine and par@@ oxet@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ ages .
in CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abolic diseases , the joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher Plas@@ mat@@ ec@@ onds of Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol result in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively met@@ abolic diseases .
considering the joint G@@ abe of Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with abili@@ fy should predomin@@ ate the potential risks to patients &quot; potential .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ Con@@ duc@@ tors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar ric@@ tions .
after sam@@ pling of the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised to the dosage height at the beginning of the companion therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 jointly with abili@@ fy can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations .
in clinical trials , doses shown by 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol per day no significant effect on the met@@ abolic Surgery of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ xy@@ morph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ di@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ Rati@@ o ) , 2C@@ 9 ( om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ext@@ ro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ ate ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ et@@ ol .
due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns used in the animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits therefore justified the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ach@@ ol has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects occurred more often ( representing 1 / 100 ) than on plac@@ ebo or were considered as possible medical relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects specified below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study evaluated by patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ie@@ ol , an overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and dy@@ sk@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l ( 57.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study conducted over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS is 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ men@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ zene , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under o@@ lan@@ ni@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l treatment .
in a different study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS compared to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ men@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ al@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison of the patient groups among Ari@@ pi@@ al@@ z@@ ol and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , revealed by no medic@@ ally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , patients have been observed at 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ol . compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients .
among the side @-@ effects associated with anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ al syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ular and increased ster@@ ility in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch have been acci@@ dental or ab@@ sicht@@ able over@@ do@@ si@@ ders with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol alone in adult patients with estimated doses from up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a tick @-@ conditions in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ og@@ gles in the treatment is a high pl@@ asma cutting .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ach@@ ol in schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder via the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is convey@@ ed .
Ari@@ pi@@ fo@@ z@@ ol found in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and an excessive aff@@ in@@ arity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1@@ ep@@ hr@@ ine and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ al@@ z@@ ol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed the Pos@@ it@@ ons @-@ fix@@ ture reduction in bonds of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recept@@ ors , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ ti@@ us and on the put@@ stream .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled course studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo a statist@@ ically significant improvement of the psychological symptoms .
in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l @-@ controlled trial was 52 % of the responsibility of the Respon@@ sibility patients who retained a speech on the study drug , in both groups ( Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l 73 % ) .
current values from sc@@ ales , which were defined as secondary studio agents , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression , showed a significant stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks at stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia showed himself a significant reduction of dis@@ inf@@ est@@ rate , which was placed at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ni@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schi@@ zop@@ hr@@ enia , over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients had com@@ prised a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. a increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of approx . 6,@@ 6 kg ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage 3 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol a superior to plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks using fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol compared to plac@@ ebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and actively @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode , Ari@@ pi@@ en@@ z@@ ol showed a superior to plac@@ ebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a sustain@@ ing effect that was comparable to that of li@@ thium , Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ us@@ z@@ ol also proved to be a comparable proportion of patients with the symp@@ tom@@ atic removal of the man@@ ie on such as li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psychological characteristics , which in part spoke about 2 weeks not on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with li@@ thium or Val@@ pro@@ at .

with Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol there are no differences in the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ological investigation of schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ic patients showed no sex @-@ dependent effects .
a resource @-@ specific evaluation for the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics revealed a notice to clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking on the pharmac@@ op@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ al@@ z@@ ol .
pharmac@@ ological properties of Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ie@@ ol and Deh@@ oh@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a Ret@@ ri@@ osis study at Pro@@ b@@ anden with differ@@ ential radi@@ ator cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver cancer and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ p@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which does not suff@@ ice to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety technology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , reproduction , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ op@@ ogen@@ ous potential the pre@@ clinical data has no special haz@@ ards to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in doses , or exposure , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure for people , so they have limited to the clinical use only limited or no importance .
the effects caused a dos@@ is@@ dependent adren@@ aly@@ sis ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin or pig@@ ment exposure to female ) and an increase of adren@@ al barriers among female ) and an increase of adren@@ al bar@@ ric@@ ants and combined ear canal treatment ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ times of middle ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended dosage dose of people ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the ph@@ yl@@ ation of sul@@ ph@@ ate @-@ const@@ ants from Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol in the G@@ alle from monkeys to repet@@ itive or@@ iti@@ vity from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81@@ cm the recommended dosage dose of people based on mg / m2 .
however , in the human G@@ alle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of concentr@@ ations of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ z@@ ol not more than 6 % of the concentr@@ ations , which were detected in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limits ( 6 % ) of the in vit@@ ro dis@@ solution .
with rab@@ bits these effects were observed in doses , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ f of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical max@@ im osis .

the effectiveness of abra@@ x@@ ane has been studied in a main study , where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer who had received a anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine in the past three quarters .
the effect of abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ ot@@ ings or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug with a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
overall speaking at the main stu@@ die 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients treated patients with abra@@ sion to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 female patients , which received conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el supplements .
considering only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there were no difference between efficacy studies such as time as far as to deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , there were patients in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer with regard to these indicators that abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ir@@ resi@@ due medicine .
it must also not be used in patients , breast@@ feeding or before starting treatment of low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ enz@@ eit@@ ers in the blood .
the commission for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ remedies ( CH@@ MP ) establishes that Abra@@ x@@ ane was with patients in which the first treatment is no longer suggests , more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el practi@@ cing drugs has to be given to other medicines to decrease side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ cience Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane to the entire European Union .

the application of abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic Mamm@@ ak@@ ar@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ coated studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study , 43 patients were treated with metastatic mamm@@ al lo@@ bb@@ ying with abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second trial , a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as inf@@ usion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mamm@@ al cin@@ oma .
this multi@@ cent@@ red study was conducted in patients with metastatic mamm@@ al infections , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ based Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ valence of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medi@@ ums ( N = 229 ) .
in the trial in the study 64 % of the patients had a imp@@ air@@ condition of the general public ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 Met@@ ast@@ as@@ est@@ ellen .

• Schul@@ ungs@@ bro@@ sch@@ üre • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( professional information ) , lab@@ eling and pack content . • With unique imaging rate of the correct use of the product feed @-@ boxes for transport through the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also &quot; reference media &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , where associated with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if in front of the intervention , an individual ble@@ eding is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with se@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disease , for which the drug is displayed .
in case of patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a professional circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a V@@ ene .
inj@@ ections may also be made by the patient or his supervis@@ ors if they have received a reasonable manual .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the tick @-@ glo@@ bin@@ ary values should always remain in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are ahead of the treatment to ensure that there is no lack of iron , and iron supple@@ mentary should be administ@@ ered throughout the treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an ana@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ as@@ sment or thereby that the body does not sufficiently address the body &apos;s own ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which they are designed to form ep@@ o@@ et@@ in al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with appointments as inj@@ ecting in a V@@ ene during a main stu@@ d with 4@@ 79 patients who suffer from kidney problems , compared with the Reference bul@@ b .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene before they were either issued on se@@ amed or continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in hem@@ orrho@@ ids between the beginning of the trial and the period period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study where the effects were examined by the skin of pr@@ er@@ amed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received one chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ bodi@@ ment of patients who have been adjusted to Ab@@ se@@ amed to maintain in the same measure as with those patients who continue to be E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to these patients , the patients continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the cur@@ ated by 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the com@@ mon@@ est side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , the occasionally to symptoms of a enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ ing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and turbul@@ ence can lead .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients , which may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or any other ingredients .
ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , since further studies are needed to ensure that this is triggered by no allergic reactions .
the committee for human therapeutic t@@ ends ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed was produced in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that medicine has generated a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufac@@ tures the se@@ amed is provide for medical staff in all member states , including information about the safety of the drug .
August 2007 , the European Commission granted to the company Medi@@ ce Drug P@@ mothers GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following illnesses : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones spr@@ itt@@ le ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
it is applied in patients with a high cargo risk ( bone erup@@ tions ) , including those patients who have recently suffered a small trau@@ mati@@ ic gir@@ dle as when they were dropped ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fac@@ tion should obtain a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle .
the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ole or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta , that in the three days after the inf@@ usion of symptoms , such as fe@@ ver , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ tit symptoms , pain @-@ pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et al@@ cl@@ asta not only prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating the disease .
as the substance in A@@ cl@@ asta , the same as in Zom@@ eta , was part of the data material for Zom@@ eta to assess the review of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in the first study nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of sp@@ ine and hip frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of three years .
the second study involved 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years that had recently been led to hip frac@@ ture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures for over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies for a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
main indi@@ k@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the sal@@ ary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate in Ser@@ um ( an enzy@@ me un@@ fores@@ een ) in the blood to norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the output .
in the study involving older women the risk of sp@@ ouses in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients in plac@@ ebo by 70 % reduced .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ os@@ em@@ edi@@ bles ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip replacement , 9 % of the patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a Fra@@ ktur ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta appear within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta must not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate to patients with A@@ cl@@ asta , the risk of kidney stones , reactions to inf@@ usion and oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta offers clar@@ ified material for physicians to waste the A@@ cl@@ asta to the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains evidence of how the drug is to use , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug should be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission granted to the Company Nov@@ art@@ is Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited registered a permit for the transport of A@@ cl@@ asta throughout the European Union .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men the intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta once a year is recommended .
in patients with a low @-@ sad hip replacement , the administration of inf@@ usion is recommended by A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip replacement ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ an with A@@ cl@@ asta was a long re@@ ission period in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently er@@ owed low @-@ trau@@ mat@@ ology hip , a initi@@ ates is recommended from 5@@ 0.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. or@@ alem or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days following the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ole or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.4 ) for patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta not recommended , as limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
older patients ( holders 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people of A@@ cl@@ asta not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 , as data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness are lacking .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because of this patient population is limited to limited clinical experiences .
an existing hyp@@ ok@@ al@@ z@@ emia is before the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta through sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick brow@@ sing of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , it can develop temporary , occasionally symp@@ tom@@ atic hyp@@ ok@@ al@@ z@@ emia whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of a@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) .
additionally , it is very advis@@ able to guarantee patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , according to calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .

for patients who require dental input , no data is available , whether the break of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate is reduced to oste@@ opor@@ osis in the pin@@ ew@@ ood area .
clinical assessment by the doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced by means of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ole or in@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of as serious side @-@ effects reported in patients who were the A@@ cl@@ asta could increase ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 % to 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who were plac@@ ebo ( 22 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .

kidney failure Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which is associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in Ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured against administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were in a clinical study at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 percent of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients with plac@@ ebo patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratories the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic calcium found , which treated below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , with 2.3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a major clinical trial involving patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures , after a hip replacement and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a recently er@@ ected hip replacement were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initi@@ ate vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local responses after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ oric acid in a major clinical study has been reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ opath@@ ies in the pin@@ ew@@ ood occasionally , mainly in cancer patients , about Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primary in the j@@ aw field ) reports the with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

the a@@ cl@@ asta treatment carried out more than 24 months compared to the plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.2 % by the total and at 4.3 % at the archipelago .
clinical efficacy in men In HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were evaluated 5@@ 08 men and at 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; pre@@ valence of clinical frac@@ tures declined 7.5 % at A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study on men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once daily administration of A@@ cl@@ asta first referred to the percentage change in ste@@ al wir@@ bel from BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the starting point .

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proven in two six months studies .
in the combined outcome , after 6 months a similar break@@ age of pain k@@ ill@@ ings and pain ratio was observed compared to the cur@@ b for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were qualified at the end of the six @-@ month main study as responsible ( on the therapy ) , could be recorded at a post@@ operative phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients who participated in the after@@ math test , the therapeutic approach could be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .

the early divisions ( α and ß , with the above @-@ 2 -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid res@@ absorption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the f@@ ool dose is found in urine , while the rest is attached mainly to bone tissue .
the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose : 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of inf@@ usion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic@@ - concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( pl@@ asma centre ) .
a decreased clearing @-@ out of cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzy@@ me met@@ abolic substances is unlikely , because c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed and because it is a watch@@ ful or not even more direct and / or irre@@ versible , metabolism inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -

it follows that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney failure to down to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .

Abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public of this document is a summary of the European Public Government reports ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which studies is assessed as the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ end@@ ers ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
action is applied to the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as in ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied solely ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic medication ) is not displayed along with another Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ k@@ ament ( dual therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can not be customized with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acc@@ u@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ onic treatment can be kept , except in patients with hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ res@@ cu@@ ffs or ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can be improved and the blood sugar mount that makes type @-@ 2 diabetes better .
with more than 1 400 patients the patients were examined for medication therapy ; in this case patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ onic nit@@ rogen , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either as either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in trials of studies the concentration of substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ mo@@ vi@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to lo@@ wering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c factory , which suggests that the blood sugar values when used in application of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ y study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ onic nit@@ rogen in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values around 0,94 % , while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo has led to a reduction of 0.35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and ins@@ ulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who accounts in addition to ins@@ ulin , reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 20 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who were additionally plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract ( cold ) , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ ana@@ esth@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to Rei@@ zen ) .
ac@@ tos must neither be applied to patients who may possibly be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor even in patients with liver problems , in@@ gest@@ ive heart or di@@ ab@@ etic Ket@@ o@@ azi@@ oni ( high levels of ket@@ ac@@ ces - inf@@ ants - blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in common use ) is intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
October 2000 , the European Commission granted to the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited registered a permit for the marketing of accounts in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to white , v@@ aul@@ ted and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also displayed for combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate and in which Met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance . ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering by the presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. grown coron@@ ary heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose .
patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain or loop , particularly those with reduced di@@ oc@@ al reserve .
patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of a con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure , weight gain and can be observed if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular ab@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced extraction disease has been conducted .

in patients with increased export @-@ liver enz@@ ym@@ es ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of norm@@ ality ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one must not be used .
when the AL@@ T shows up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardi@@ zation area increases , the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers are as soon as possible to control once again .
if a patient develop symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , rou@@ gh@@ ness , fatigue , appeal and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ ers to check .
the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ is should continue , should be guided by the clinical examination of the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be typ@@ ed by fat deposits , and in some cases connected with a fluid re@@ tion .
as a result of a hem@@ orrho@@ rate joined the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction of average hem@@ mo@@ or relative ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ rac@@ id ( relative reduction of 4.2 % ) .

as a result of the increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity to patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ is@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or as a branch of inter@@ connec@@ tive therapy with ins@@ ulin , is the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market introduction , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on an occurrence , or a deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ etic son@@ ic mo@@ dem with a dimin@@ ishing of the visual shar@@ p@@ ness .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ men should be aware of the possibility of a Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report about interference of visual conditions ; a suitable ophthal@@ mic assessment should be considered .

the calcul@@ ating Fra@@ ktur incidence was 1.9 Fra@@ encies per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated to women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years for women who were treated with an equivalent medical treatment .
in the pro@@ active study , a study conducted over 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular events , compared with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated to patients with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who have been treated with a sym@@ cancer treatment .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is ab@@ duc@@ ted ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for exam@@ ining the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on the Pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ omena and Met@@ form@@ in .

the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2@@ C8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2@@ C8 ro@@ tractor ) result in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to the fact that treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on increases in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance , and thus reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ bine and the break@@ down of the lens , as they are also observed in other hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substance .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ kes over the tri@@ mmer of the standard range also frequently appears on the same as plac@@ ebo but less common than in compar@@ ative groups under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced un@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease the incidence of a severe fall in@@ con@@ gest@@ ive heart under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 percent higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or ...

it has been conducted a summary analysis of reports undes@@ irable events with regard to bone break@@ through@@ s from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
in the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures appeared at 44 / 870 ( 5.3 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients treated with a sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ation .
while taking the maximum daily dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days were not symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to act on an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of li@@ er- , li@@ pos@@ - and sk@@ elet@@ on @-@ muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the Glu@@ cos@@ e@@ production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral of Glu@@ cos@@ iness in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the period until the after@@ leave of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ¬ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatments ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar figure could be defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ( 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared 50 % of patients under Gli@@ ob@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol study on 12 months , patients , their blood sugar was placed in spite of three @-@ month optimization h@@ ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value for 0,45 % , compared to the patients who continue to be only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin delivery in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
in clinical trials over a year showed themselves under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , an statist@@ ically significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in contrac@@ tor compared to the output value .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg and plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 weeks and tested by type @-@ 2 di@@ ab@@ etics .
in most clinical trials , compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the overall pl@@ asma tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low @-@ level , however clin@@ ically did not be significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels .

in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , A@@ den@@ uri@@ c received a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who once daily took a res@@ ist in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
this was compared to 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in any of 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ uri@@ c ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and ab@@ normal life values .
especially for patients with heart damage in pre@@ history , possibly there is also an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the fund for human therapeutic tools ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ed to the conclusion that A@@ den@@ uri@@ c was more effective in the blood pressure in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones bro@@ ods in the men@@ opause , where a risk is for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) minimum 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intro@@ duc@@ tions of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and Vit@@ amin@@ supple@@ mentary ) .
to avoid an irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up to after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , registered in the European Union , the company presented data collected from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to verify the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in relation to the increase in the vitamin D sp@@ y .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D mirror in patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE ( 11 % ) than with those who were exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data on , which indicate that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE contained Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at @-@ dose is exactly the dose which is required to prevent a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal body such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ es ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ) , const@@ ip@@ ation ( inf@@ est@@ ation ) , const@@ ip@@ ation ( bli@@ lit@@ igation ) , dy@@ sp@@ y ( si@@ eves ) , flo@@ ating cas@@ ing ( lo@@ op@@ holes ) , twi@@ sted be@@ dom@@ es ( b@@ other belly ) as well as su@@ ck absor@@ b@@ ump .
in patients with any hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( all@@ ergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
it must not be applied in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who can not stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is just with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and Vit@@ amin@@ supple@@ mentary ) for the day .
the following hin@@ ts are to follow precisely in order to reduce the risk for mal@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation , and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not feed the tablet or put the tablet in the mouth , since a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before the first dietary intake of the day , that should take place only 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ age@@ al responses , such as Eco @-@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ oph@@ age@@ ale Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ oms , frequently followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al strings , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required a hospital ) .
the doctor therefore should attentive to any signs and symptoms , which should point out on possible solutions , and the patients should be advised to susp@@ end the occurrence of symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ est@@ ial pain or new or themselves wor@@ mer@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and fet@@ ish medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of heavy ign@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the drug correctly and / or it after the appearance of symptoms that point out to a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation , further .
it is very important that all d@@ osing references to the patient are passed and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was established , many severe ( after market introduction ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose of the Kie@@ j@@ aw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including Oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ ists predomin@@ ate predomin@@ antly intraven@@ ously according to cancer .
there are no data available to give the notes , whether or decre@@ asing a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a sh@@ ale surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the j@@ aw .
clinical assessment by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor is author@@ itative for treatment planning in each patient based on individual benefit risk assessment .

because of the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular identification of ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ onin levels , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance and a monitoring of ur@@ inary care ) is recommended .
change from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in the conversion from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ dum to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see Fig@@ ure 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the fe@@ ed@@ ity in full blu@@ ff@@ ing The dose should primarily rely on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and compatibility with pl@@ aid of full blu@@ et@@ ting @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m @-@ sli@@ ding controls .
it is recommended frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by peri@@ odi@@ c checks during the accounting therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ is@@ custom@@ isation , changes of immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus thorou@@ gh@@ an@@ ate ble@@ eding ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments for the dose can take several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered .
the data in clinical studies allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the aging of blood in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml is not exceed .
in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can usually lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and n@@ ish and transplan@@ ts patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent acquisition of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts have generally been used to ble@@ ak concentration in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including tran@@ ts and other side effects that can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ ex@@ position .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; re@@ placing the formulation or regime , should only be carried out under the tigh@@ ter control of a medical certificate ( see Fig@@ pp@@ 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ts , which turned out to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ si@@ va as a therap@@ ist , there are still no clinical data for ret@@ arded formulation no@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
to proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t @-@ breeding at adult heart transplan@@ t ideas and transplan@@ t in Kin@@ des@@ age are still no clinical data for the saved wording fr@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions between the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a ton@@ ing of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can include the intake of herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies during a treatment with ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentr@@ ations being offered in the blood because the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases Pro@@ gra@@ f was referred to as Kar@@ di@@ omy@@ opath@@ y , or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which therefore may also occur under ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
additional factors , which increase the risk of such clin@@ ici@@ encies , are an existing heart attack , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ cian , blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid @-@ load and oil .
as with other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ition with suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ cre@@ en by means of a high protective factor .
if patients , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PR@@ ES like head@@ aches , modified consciousness , cr@@ as@@ ms and visual dys@@ functions should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .
because Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f Hard , ret@@ arded , lact@@ ose , is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lact@@ ase lack or gl@@ uc@@ ose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ Mal@@ on@@ osis .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as a inhibit@@ or or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase the blood @-@ values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or decrease .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels with equal representation of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and to set the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain gender concentr@@ ations corresponding to maintenance ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive changing interaction was with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ medicines such as Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ Anti@@ biot@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV / prototype ( z .
pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics studies assume that the increase in blood levels primarily from the elevated p@@ ale bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intest@@ inal exp@@ ul@@ ment .
high @-@ coated pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute exhau@@ sting reactions , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can increase or decrease in blood .
effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicinal products is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed that may affect their metabolism .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can desc@@ end the clearing of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ ti@@ va and thus increase the hormonal position , with decisions about recep@@ tive measures to be particularly careful .
the results of animals have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of Pen@@ to@@ bar@@ bit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a minor number of investigations on transplan@@ t patients provide no indication that under the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ress@@ ants an increased risk of unwanted events related to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o &apos;s exposure , a surveillance of new n@@ atives is advised on any harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its impact on the kid@@ neys ) .

due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high bond to ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and pl@@ asma @-@ one can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
efficacy mechanism and pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects On molecular level , effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be convey@@ ed by its bond to a cy@@ tos@@ tic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the rich@@ ment of the connection in the cell@@ ars .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with hed@@ ge@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( a due to the lack of factor VIII @-@ related , inn@@ ate blood @-@ disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of application are directed after it is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or to the prevention of ble@@ eding used in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII def@@ ect which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human pl@@ asma , but after a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought into , which they may become the formation of the human body factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is different , but that medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies on patients with heavy to moderate hed@@ ger@@ m@@ hi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of blood tests as well as surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of ship@@ ments in 86 % of 510 new blood cl@@ ot@@ ones has been awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; respectively .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fe@@ ver ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ aller@@ gen or any other ingredients .
March 2004 the European Commission granted the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG appro@@ ached approval for the transport of Adv@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII def@@ ect , according to the place and extent of blood and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ orrho@@ id events the factor VIII acti@@ vi@@ or in the corresponding period does not sink under the given pl@@ asma seal ( in % of the norm or in i.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
during the treatment session it is applied to control the inj@@ ections of the inj@@ ections ® and the frequency of the inj@@ ections factor VIII .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis of proph@@ yla@@ xis use in patients with severe h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given boxes between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. as factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ pl@@ asma activities are not achieved or when the ble@@ eding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ or values it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic interventions must be explored .
the appointments set should be directed following the patient &apos;s payment , whereby the maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with h@@ amm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .

based on the data posted since the initial data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be considered positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP was charged on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ENT , which requires a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the author@@ ization should apply for another renewal applications in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited by the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ osis ( CH@@ MP ) officially recognised that the enterprise takes its application for approval for the transport of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the cor@@ ds ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , and it does not base ) .
these are a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
with the virus in Adv@@ ant@@ in , it is a &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has changed so that there cannot produce copies of himself , thus no infection can cause infections in humans .
Adv@@ ant@@ in would have been crow@@ ned right into the tum@@ ors and allow canc@@ er@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is made from the def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to the killing of the cells in when the DNA can &apos;t be restored .
at Li @-@ women @-@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ect , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and divide .
the company put data from a study involving patients before the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of sub @-@ producing , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions presented , some questions were un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents the CH@@ MP created a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not enough that the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ors takes advantage of patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
furthermore , the company did not sufficiently proved that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not acknowledge the CH@@ MP opinion , whether the withdrawal and consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comp@@ assi@@ on@@ est Use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so mer@@ ged that one of the effective components is immediately un@@ released over a few hours .
Aer@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fe@@ ver , caused by an all@@ ergy to pol@@ len ( inflammation of the nose @-@ way ) in patients with n@@ ak@@ e@@ av@@ al sw@@ elling ( hidden nose ) .
in adults and teenagers from 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ ators is twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , above all the sw@@ elling of the Nas@@ en@@ end@@ omet@@ ri@@ um ( hidden nose ) .
a treatment duration of over 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be done on the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .
the main function dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ yst@@ ail symptoms that were reported by the patients before starting treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients took their symptoms every 12 hours in a di@@ ary and evaluated with a standard scale , how hard the symptoms experienced in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all h@@ ay symptoms , except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ ze reported on a decrease of the symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared to 35,@@ 9 % in patients with p@@ seudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the Nas@@ en@@ schl@@ eim@@ kin has been seen , patients under the aer@@ ation showed a alle@@ vi@@ ation of the symptoms by 37,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ al ( cardi@@ ac ) , anti @-@ irrit@@ ation , head@@ ache , head@@ aches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ ed@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ ity ) , ins@@ cri@@ ab@@ rup@@ tions and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ ation may not be in@@ sensitive to patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other components , acc@@ ep@@ hr@@ ined ingredients or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( a different drug for treating allergi@@ es ) are not applied .
Aer@@ ation may also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow margin ( increased eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ id ( brid@@ ging the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have already had a hem@@ orrho@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( through a brain blood circulation ) or have a risk to the hem@@ os@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the firm Europe Europe to appro@@ ve approval for the marketing of aer@@ ators in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ack , to break or ch@@ ew ) .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied to inf@@ util@@ isation and effectiveness , due to the lack of data on un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended that limit duration to 10 days , as with long @-@ term application the activity of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take in time .
after the drop of sw@@ elling of the v@@ eil in the upper breath , treatment can continue when needed with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ contamin@@ oxid@@ ative ( MA@@ O ) or are being treated within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combin@@ able use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ uri@@ d , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ mb@@ ot@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient @-@ li@@ fic value and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations regarding dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ ation units were not tested in patients with kidney or liver tumor and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations regarding dosage .
patients must be informed that treatment at the occurrence of a hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ine or of Pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ op@@ ar@@ ism , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of the head@@ ache ) must be decre@@ asing .
in the treatment of the following patient groups is recommended to care : • Pati@@ ents under digit@@ alis • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dio market in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bronze work in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ ina@@ ze is to im@@ pose some 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin actions respectively .
in the framework of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered , however no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the pl@@ ain@@ t@@ osis of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have been observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests were no significant differences between patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those treated with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or alcohol was taken .
the enzy@@ me of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies have shown that the Drug CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able use of the use of aer@@ ation during pregnancy is not backed up experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and because of the vas@@ o@@ stri@@ kt@@ or@@ ical properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be used in pregnancy .

for children between the ages of six to eleven is the dose of 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies involving some 4 800 adults and juven@@ iles with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies of seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies of patients who had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by setting the change of symptoms ( itch , number and size of the j@@ add@@ ling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and capacity in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment was established .
there were further studies presented to prove that the body gets the sy@@ rup , the solution to inv@@ ading and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same manner , as the tablets and application in children is harmless .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us were considered to be an average decrease of symp@@ tom ( symp@@ tom ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who were given a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the receipt of the sym@@ scores returned to six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any other ingredients .

the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the recent disease progression and can be res@@ umed after the repe@@ al of symptoms and resume at their re @-@ emergence .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during all@@ ergy period .
clinical @-@ relevant interactions have been observed in the framework of clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ mi@@ ine tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administ@@ ered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , they were not reinforced by A@@ eri@@ us and to alcohol the powerful effects of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be discussed , however , that in very rare cases it can be contradic@@ tory , which may lead to a imp@@ air@@ ment of transportation or ability to use machines .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side @-@ side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported side effects reported on more pre@@ valent in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth@@ wat@@ ering ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 ju@@ gend@@ um patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effects , these were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with 6,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ unit study , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) have been administ@@ ered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ ge@@ or@@ ous cy@@ tok@@ ens as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 , and IL @-@ 13 from human m@@ esh / Bas@@ oph@@ ile , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the eagle &apos;s P le@@ ver@@ ine on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has been administ@@ ered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the N@@ en@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administ@@ ered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval indicated .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study with adults showed des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening subjective per@@ sever@@ ity or the tasks which are associated with the flies .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nose @-@ secre@@ tion and ju@@ ck@@ ers of the nose , rejo@@ icing , ri@@ but@@ ary , and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as ju@@ ck@@ ers at the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and Per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be split in dependence of the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent Rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ edly allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall appearance of the frag@@ ment of the frag@@ ment of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ vit@@ is , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished the seasonal rhin@@ itis caused by the seasonal rhin@@ itis caused by the seasonal rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was re@@ examined for other forms of ur@@ ron@@ ics , since the underlying path@@ ology , regardless of apples in various forms is similar and chron@@ ically en@@ rolled .
as the hist@@ amine is a conden@@ ser factor in all ur@@ inary disorders , is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also confirmed in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria to enhance the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and numbers of Qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin service .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who do not re@@ acting on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the trial excluded .
an improvement in the itch around 50 % has been observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wax significantly , as measured with a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ populations , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .

the overall pre@@ valence of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ up group as were the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials of adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic urine , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more adverse reactions in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ payment dose of adults and teenagers , to be administ@@ ered up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years that have been asked for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( between the ages of 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between the ages of 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be extr@@ ap@@ oli@@ zed by adults on the children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ specialist in adults and young people , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistical and clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the N@@ en@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults showed itself not an extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies there was no increased frequency of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers , no increased frequency of sle@@ e@@ ity when compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in clinical studies led to no imp@@ air@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .

as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statistical and clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
at a 30 single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening subjective per@@ sever@@ ity or the tasks which are associated with the flies .

the overall pre@@ valence of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group as were in the plac@@ ebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months the most commonly used @-@ side effects reported on more pre@@ valent in plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fe@@ ver ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution were observed in an additional study involving patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
at the recommended doses , the pl@@ asma @-@ concentr@@ ations were comparable to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) in the nur@@ sery and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies there was no increased frequency of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers , no increased frequency of sle@@ e@@ ity when compared to plac@@ ebo .

June 2008 Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ scher ( CH@@ MP ) officially recognised that the enterprise takes its application for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to the protection against flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influ@@ enza type virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a future pan@@ dem@@ ic in front of a trunk of the flu and a future pan@@ dem@@ ic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new trunk of gri@@ pping @-@ virus spreads , that can easily spread from man to man because people have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine the immune system sees the immune system contained in the vaccine contained the parts of the gri@@ pping @-@ virus as &quot; physical @-@ stran@@ ds &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later in a position to form a contact with a gri@@ pping @-@ virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface environment &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as a body @-@ stran@@ gled ) , certified and used as a part of the vaccine .
inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine does not consist of meeting the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA to pre @-@ pan@@ dem@@ ic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s doctor .

it is used in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with human@@ ly immun@@ o@@ we@@ eds in AIDS ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules , can be taken as a solution to boarding , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gen@@ ase should only be en@@ acted if the doctor has tested which anti @-@ vir@@ al medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood of the virus will address to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is determined according to the body weight .
aging increases in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines that are HIV @-@ quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level .
AIDS not to cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infection and disease .
A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ vir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which previously had not been treated with defects .
this was compared with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gen@@ ase was compared with 206 adults which previously had to be assessed earlier , with other types of evidence .
main @-@ indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients suffering from adverse concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the change in virus management after treatment .
in trials of patients who had previously had taken no prototype of earlier , although , after 48 weeks , more patients had a virus load of 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children changed A@@ gener@@ ase also the vir@@ al load , whereby apart from the children who had previously been treated with the release numbers , were only very few of the treatment mentioned .
in the study involving adults , which previously was treated with the release numbers , that had been treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug A@@ gener@@ ase the virus @-@ last after 16 @-@ weeks treatment just as effective as other prototype :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other proteins , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the virus after four weeks than in patients who were previously carried out their previous prototype :
the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and f@@ ati@@ gue ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) .
2 / 3 a@@ ex@@ ase should not be used in patients , which may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against le@@ ther@@ ca@@ r or any other ingredients .
a@@ generated can also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( herbal supplements for treating depression ) or drugs , which are as well as anti @-@ gener@@ ase and are taken into high concentr@@ ations in the blood of health .
as with other drugs against HIV there is to be carried out , the risk of a pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( canc@@ ers of bone tissue ) or an immune response syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system ) .
the healthcare industry ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ogen@@ etic deep@@ ening of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r but the committee establishes that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously did not have been proven to be a prototype .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as for the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 divided the European Commission to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited to appro@@ ve a permit for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prototype ( PI ) for previously untreated adults and children over 4 years .
for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administ@@ ered together with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual vir@@ al resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for entry is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , are non @-@ generated capsules and solution for dispos@@ able on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for aging capsules is 600 mg si@@ rop@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules without the ampli@@ fier add@@ itive ) used by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ st@@ erung ) must be applied greater doses of a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for aging capsules is 20 mg pay@@ load / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg pay@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other proteins mentioned children have not been studied in children .
a@@ generated is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ogen@@ etic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe life @-@ dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate @-@ functioning with caution , in case of patients with severe living @-@ functioning it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
aging may not be given simultaneously with pharmac@@ euticals , which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ ym@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) contain , may not be applied due to the risk of reduced pl@@ asma fluctu@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy leads to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al therapy including treatment with A@@ gen@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others due to sexual contact or cont@@ amination with blood .
for usual , aging capsules are to be applied along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy , have a increased risk for heavy liver navigation , potentially fatal .
in case of a simultaneous ar@@ vir@@ al treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C please read the underlying information of these drugs .
patients with pre @-@ existing haz@@ ard function including an chron@@ ically @-@ active h@@ epatitis also show increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ ster@@ oid drugs which are exchanged via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended , unless the possible benefits of a treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hung and Supp@@ lies of the adren@@ aly@@ tic function . ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction of inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of aging with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended .
4 For some drugs , may cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased pl@@ asma jet @-@ bri@@ cks ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may change the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ ti@@ va , however , the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium symptoms , especially if it can also administ@@ ered low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ co@@ operating system of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
aging should be set in duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the v@@ eils are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received a chemotherapy treatment including proteins , has been reported on the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exc@@ use of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .

CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with pharmac@@ euticals , whose active ingredients are mostly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and for the increased pl@@ as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ an associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
in the attempt to compens@@ ate the de@@ hum@@ ble pl@@ asma seal by a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very often unwanted effects on the liver .
cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ spiegel of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ kraut ( Hyper@@ icum perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes already rede@@ mp@@ ed the spec@@ k level and if possible , the pay@@ out mirror is and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and susp@@ essen the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also eb@@ avi@@ r@@ ency below ) .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max , against 30 % low , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg vi@@ als are applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the efficacy and non@@ sense of this treatment schem@@ atas .
52 % de@@ d@@ ged if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg vi@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r pl@@ asma was achieved twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg vi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered twice daily .
a dose of control for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended a close @-@ machine monitoring , since the effectiveness and non@@ sense of this combination is not known .
there has been no pharmac@@ ogen@@ etics study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with o@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the ex@@ position of both of the intervals would be extremely low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other proteins and existing limited data would be susp@@ ect that Ne@@ vir@@ al may possibly lowers the ser@@ um@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased or perhaps sub@@ therapeutic pl@@ asma .
if these drugs are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be carried out , as an accurate forecast of the effect of combining Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous display of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in the pl@@ asma centre ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in to 193 % , and thus to a increase in associated with ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ ine effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to go ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in along with A@@ gen@@ ase , is going to dimin@@ ish the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dosage , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ogen@@ etics studies with nuclear ass@@ emb@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the pl@@ asma @-@ lo@@ ys of both drug could be enhanced in the case of current administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole per day led to an increase in C@@ max of Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in Plas@@ ma at 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ profit ) to the 2,@@ 69@@ Y once a day without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with aging effects , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are combined with these drugs once they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other components , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acid can not be taken at the same time as as@@ ex@@ ase as it can come to res@@ or@@ atory disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va that are known as an enzy@@ me no@@ un@@ ces ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degrad@@ ation of the pl@@ asma @-@ bri@@ cks of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium @-@ can@@ es such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , default , Nim@@ odi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can increase 10 by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake with nuclear ass@@ emblies can considerably increase and increase pl@@ asma @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days dropped significantly , while the end@@ ogen@@ ic Kort@@ is@@ ol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ levels interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous generation of A@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended along with these gl@@ uc@@ ose veins , unless that the possible benefits of a treatment are the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ kt@@ ase inhibit@@ or such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose ri@@ cher was heavily dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect the pl@@ asma jet at equivalent of a@@ gen@@ ase .
since Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ egel@@ ung of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Redu@@ kt@@ ase inhibit@@ or to My@@ opath@@ y , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ se , the combined application of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the pl@@ asma @-@ concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased when used by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , al@@ gener@@ ative may not be applied together with administr@@ ated Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while on an equal application of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ centric Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is recommended .
data on the simultaneous application of par@@ amount co mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors point to a possible rise of pl@@ asma @-@ bars from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to the 3@@ - up to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ on can be administ@@ ered along with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium symptoms , especially if it can also administ@@ ered low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the per se small compar@@ ability of historical compar@@ isons there can currently be no recommendation such as the pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dosage is to adapt if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
in simultaneous display of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en , together with A@@ gen@@ ase , an enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of mit@@ igation or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ stress @-@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ ti@@ va is not predicted , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example , Desi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for equal absorption of as@@ gen@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after di@@ lig@@ ent cancellation of potential use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks to fet@@ us .

the further development of the income , including fer@@ ti@@ lit@@ es and re@@ productions was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the advoc@@ acy of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines .
most of the adverse effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to four , performed early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment .
many of these events have not been clar@@ ified whether they are used to be applied to HIV virus or another at the same time on HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the der@@ under@@ disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects origin@@ ate from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which with the previously previously previously untreated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily received .

on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analysis gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the present ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines Resi@@ st@@ enz as the presence of nuts L@@ 10@@ F / F , L@@ 54@@ A / F / G , I@@ 54@@ A / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with a stolen ph@@ em@@ ite with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a decreased chance of a vi@@ ro@@ logic response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ u@@ sters can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is advised to continually draw the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyze the outcome of resistance tests .
in the phenomen@@ al resistance @-@ based analysis clin@@ ically valuable inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
companies , to exp@@ el diagnostic tests tests have clin@@ ically @-@ phenomen@@ al cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated patterns generates certain Crus@@ resistant against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prototype for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al not previously untreated patients , where an Fos@@ amp@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , un@@ cl@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , ob@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , cre@@ ti@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) and ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
the other way round , Am@@ pren@@ ate ret@@ ains its activity against some other protein @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the conservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early det@@ ecting a vers@@ ing therapy is advised to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the following treatment adverse .
the evidence of the effectiveness of aging in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( $ 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ osi@@ der@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predomin@@ antly with reduced shi@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
a hundred @-@ three @-@ six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ stage A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis set the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI @-@ group with regard to the period of average sales ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the h@@ us@@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the pl@@ asma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ under@@ estimated shaft of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ v@@ oo@@ zed aspir@@ ations is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 260 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , from which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution to include and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there has been no low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of patients treated with PI @-@ treated patients had previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the study included a pl@@ asma on HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output .
19 Basi@@ ola on these data should be considered at the treatment optim@@ isation with PI previously untreated children of the expected use of &quot; un@@ broken &quot; as@@ parag@@ ase .
according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for resol@@ ving the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max by contrast 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administ@@ ered .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of res@@ sor@@ ption .
the seem@@ ing quantity of distribution is roughly 430 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves on a large branch volume , as well as an immense penetration of sp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in pl@@ asma , whereby the quantity of un@@ seen Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ seen Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients during the average interval in the ste@@ ady state in the ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min .
therefore , drugs , CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duced or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 will be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gen@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily pren@@ avi@@ rus position as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ achiev@@ es than of the capsules ; therefore , are ex@@ general solution and a@@ generated capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able on a milli@@ grams .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may therefore be neglected , therefore the effect of kidney failure to be low @-@ elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r will be low .
this treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ pl@@ y@@ pi@@ eg@@ s comparable to those who are obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on se@@ pul@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred at male animals sam@@ pling h@@ epat@@ o@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome at doses of dos@@ ages upon the 2,@@ 0 @-@ fachen ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to man , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ epat@@ o@@ cell@@ ular A@@ den@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome is not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of this observed impact on humans is un@@ clear .
out of the present ex@@ position at the human , both from clinical trials and in the therapeutic application , however , little evidence of the acceptance of a clinical relevance of this discrimination .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ geni@@ uses tests , the bacterial infection tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ Ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ omes , was included in human periph@@ eral l@@ ympho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver tox@@ icity can be seen and demonstrated in the clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ati@@ ase .
so far , in clinical trials have not been observed any significant life @-@ tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase , nor after the end of the treatment .
studies for tox@@ icity in juven@@ iles , who have been treated at an age of 4 days , showed both at the terms of control as well as with regard to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and treated high Mort@@ ality .
in a system@@ ic pl@@ asma position , the significant among ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ ic ong@@ ation and minor sk@@ elet@@ on changes that point to a prolonged development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules must be applied without the ampli@@ fier add@@ itive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses must be applied to a@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for aging capsules is 20 mg pay@@ load / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg pay@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be done with care in patients with ch@@ w@@ aking or lighter body @-@ dysfunction with caution , in case of patients with severe living @-@ functioning it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs , may cause serious or life @-@ threatening adverse side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
aging should be set in duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the v@@ eils are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ roph@@ y has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment and the associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max , against 30 % low , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) administ@@ ered .
the C@@ min @-@ values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r pl@@ asma was achieved twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg vi@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administ@@ ered twice daily .
a dose of control for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but it is recommended a close @-@ machine monitoring , since the effectiveness and non@@ sense of this combination is not known .
the treatment with o@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ency in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the ex@@ position of both of the intervals would be extremely low .
if these drugs are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be carried out , as an accurate forecast of the effect of combining Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .

the clin@@ op@@ ell@@ est side @-@ effect that appeared after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in Hyp@@ ot@@ onie , which is norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid .
in a pharmac@@ ological investigation , after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine , an increasing system@@ ic concentr@@ ations of the Alp@@ ha@@ inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ens have been proven .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the effectiveness in regard to a complete break @-@ division of co@@ war@@ ts at a I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment have been significantly superior over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine therap@@ ists complete the co@@ war@@ ts whol@@ ly ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo therap@@ ists in the case ( 95 % CI ) :

the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the destination tum@@ ors were hist@@ ological vali@@ dated individual primary super@@ str@@ addle ste@@ pl@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that roughly 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this has remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine during three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period , is in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ed clinical trials .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic sor@@ c@@ als , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic AK , l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment as on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p , or in the face .
the single @-@ year data consists of two combin@@ able monitoring studies for patients with clin@@ ical separation in one or two treatment periods , a recur@@ ren@@ ment rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the in@@ concei@@ vable indications of external co@@ war@@ ts , Akt@@ en@@ ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ anti@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma are not normally found at pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dara cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with Moll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in those trials at the doses there ( 3x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks or ) .
a minimum system@@ ic acquisition of the 5 % igen I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute p@@ ants was observed at the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest pharmac@@ euticals in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and stressed 0.1 , 0,2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml when applying their face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ year period was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ h@@ our@@ ly half @-@ day application after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a former study ; this indicates a leng@@ th@@ ened re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug through in the skin .
the data on system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ sor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od by patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable with healthy adult and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fic@@ tional Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four months study on the der@@ mal tox@@ icity in the rat , doses led by 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG to significant body weight and increased ine@@ z @-@ weight ; one also four months long @-@ performed study on the der@@ mal application sur@@ rendered with the mouse no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ e@@ ity at mice in decre@@ asing administration on three days a week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors on the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small system@@ ic absorption of human skin and is not mut@@ ated , is a risk to see people due to system@@ ic exposure to very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the effective cream , earlier and in larger number than in the control group with little U@@ VR .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but it also measured its effectiveness ( including its effect in relation to reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the Ur@@ in um about 60 % , and half of the patients were reported on the end of the study a normal large liver .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , sick@@ ness , rash ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the extrem@@ ities ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ esteem , fe@@ ver and reactions on the inf@@ usion place .

the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be updated every year for all new information that may possibly be disclosed , check and update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is treated patients who have Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the response to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission granted to the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a licence for the road transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using the use of Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al @-@ cell cell ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for long@@ time enz@@ ym@@ ation in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ d@@ osis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase shortage ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can if the patient can toler@@ ate this , every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for such patients no d@@ osing ema can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver ail@@ ure failure has not been determined and for these patients no d@@ osing ema can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients may develop inf@@ usi@@ ble @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any linked side effect , which occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , specifically these patients should also continue to be sur@@ vey@@ ed to be sur@@ vey@@ ed and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be provided in a reasonable clinical setting , in the re @-@ animated facilities available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to be almost all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the course of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
as little experience regarding restoring the treatment after a longer break , has to be cau@@ ti@@ ous due to the theoretically enhanced risk reaction after a break of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ pies ) treat to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of mild or indirect inf@@ usion reaction should treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ole / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen wo@@ unded and / or a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped , until the symptoms are brought to fall , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is natural .
inf@@ usion can increase with a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred to be res@@ umed .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of an interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
the Experim@@ ental studies do not allow direct or indirect negative effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
because no data of new@@ bor@@ ns , who were exp@@ on@@ ated towards Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me does not satisfy .
the side effects in clinical studies were categor@@ ised mainly as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions that were reported in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medications in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that have been observed during phase 3@@ - study and renewal with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are in the following table following the following frequency : very frequently ( paragraph 1 / 100 ) ; common ( validity 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in history occurred in addition heavy reactions to , including bronze , respir@@ atory and facial hair ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children of unwanted drugs in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ em@@ ite 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly heavy destruction and a treatment duration up to 12 months , have been listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously d@@ osed once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
most patients occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ converter , whereby the patients at the age of 5 came to a serving dish ( average of 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature pre@@ cip@@ itation from the study ) were reported by 13 / 45 patients no through radi@@ o@@ immun@@ o@@ int@@ e@@ ation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say thought@@ ful antibodies including 3 patients , where there was never a wa@@ ist version .
patients with f@@ law@@ ful to low level of antibodies are directed to a robust reduction in the G@@ AG Spi@@ eg@@ els in Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies in the har@@ n was a variable reduction in G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ale until low NEU@@ TRA@@ LI@@ Z@@ ING inhibit@@ or activity on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted medications , even if the occurrence of unwanted reactions typically with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ me is located in one of the hy@@ d@@ rol@@ ys@@ is of the accum@@ ulated sub@@ str@@ ate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enz@@ ym@@ es .
according to intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion , the lar@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and made of cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ om , most likely about Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eb@@ ok@@ ont@@ rol@@ ed phase @-@ 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study the whole disease of disease was incur@@ red , the majority of patients were of the middle @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ e and only a patient found the serious phen@@ otyp@@ e .
patients have been en@@ rolled , if they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ relevant volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute hearing in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently registered for an open @-@ label extensions stu@@ d where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to be treated to the plac@@ ebo group an improvement in the lung function and the hearing capacity , shown in the following table .
an open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 week in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as described in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period clin@@ ically and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportion@@ ate to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hep@@ atom@@ y level before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study a normal living @-@ size . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear break@@ down of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant up to the degree of study .
with regard to the heter@@ ogen@@ eous in@@ consistency between patients who take into account the clin@@ ically significant difference between the patients who , through the use of a combined end@@ point layer ( expected to increase the training area of AH@@ I and At@@ arr@@ ho@@ fe ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ round phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmac@@ op@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were investigated at 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe moving @-@ form and 4 with medium @-@ runs form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased for increased gases in Har@@ n during the last 26 weeks at 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found after the Z @-@ Score for this age group . the younger patients with the heavy ret@@ ard@@ s@@ form is directed at a normal mental stage show , whereas the older patients with severe deser@@ tion form was limited only limited or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies of pharmac@@ od@@ ynam@@ ic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me met@@ ering chem@@ ata was performed at the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously d@@ osed once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous once a week , 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
the met@@ ering scheme with 200 e / kg of intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks , with patients who have difficulties with weekly infectious diseases ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two d@@ osing schem@@ ata is equivalent .

the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows therefore the formation of DNA and RNA and prevented that cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in canc@@ er@@ ous cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug , and a longer functioning in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ing Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , Alim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously had no chemotherapy at their condition previously .
in the treatment of non @-@ soci@@ able lung cancer , the effects of Alim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disorder , previously compared with chemotherapy performed by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different drug against cancer ) .
Alim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , although both in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with Alim@@ ta and Cis@@ plat@@ in , above average 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in case of some administration of Cis@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who had previously received an chemotherapy , the average life @-@ lifetime with Alim@@ ent@@ is 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer are not regarding the record of epi@@ th@@ eli@@ um cells , regarding administration of the Alim@@ ta &apos;s longer lifetime than with the s@@ acr@@ yl ament .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a licence for the food delivery of Alim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
any di@@ vest@@ s must be re@@ combin@@ able with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.9 % of so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) - that is a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ ck@@ sis is taken from the flow bottles and with 0.9 % of so@@ dium hydro@@ chlori@@ de inj@@ ecting solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more dil@@ uted ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in displayed for first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic archi@@ ving bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is shown for treatment in second @-@ line treatment for patients with lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body ( KO@@ F ) is administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ plat@@ in amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an inf@@ usion of a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patient with non @-@ loving bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy is the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion for 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
reduction in frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ cian put@@ id .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also maintain a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third supplement treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should each receive a full blood image created , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ atic circuit .
the al@@ kal@@ ische phosph@@ ati@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ contamin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ anin @-@ Trans@@ contamin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SG@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a Dos@@ age test must take place under ber@@ en@@ sers of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood@@ shot or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to information in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria meet the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) affecting C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
if patients are non @-@ here@@ tical Tox@@ icity 5.3 degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy has to be interrupted by ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient gets the value prior to treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA has to be canc@@ eled when in patients after 2 dosage , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurring or so@@ - continue at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients in the age of 65 years , or over in comparison with patients aged 65 years , an increased by @-@ effective side effects .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 because of sufficient data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of Mus@@ cle 45 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment necessary for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a live @-@ capacity limit &gt; the 1.5 @-@ triple of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border @-@ value and / or trans@@ contamin@@ ated values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper Grenz@@ wer@@ tes ( at Ab@@ - Wes@@ er &apos;s limb@@ s ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ fachen des upper Grenz@@ wer@@ tes ( in existence of liver metastatic ) not specifically studied in trials .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone of bone preservation and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administ@@ ered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic figure has once again reached a value of affecting 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ at number has once again reached a value of roughly 100,000 cells / mm .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ a number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ number and maximum non @-@ ugly tox@@ icity , how they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) .
a reduced tox@@ icity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ th@@ ae@@ ological tox@@ icity like Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , mag@@ ically Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was observed , if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients must be instruc@@ ted to be patient treated with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ etic measure to apply to action @-@ conditional tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid the simultaneous exter@@ mination of anti @-@ oxid@@ ant anti@@ ph@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which a therapy is provided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ value pairs for at least 5 days before treatment , at least 2 days after the therapy with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liqui@@ dity - accumulation of trans@@ cell@@ ular space is a dra@@ inage of the lo@@ osing in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ os , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , when this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use atten@@ u@@ ate vital substances ( except schol@@ ars , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an irre@@ versible skull of the reproductive @-@ capacity is caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out prior to the treatment - g@@ inn to obtain advice on the sperm activation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance maxi : 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ logic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses ( 5@@ 1,3 g daily ) to decrease of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing status 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or a@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid are used in high doses .
( see Section 4.4 ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - ac@@ idity at a high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , during the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ per@@ ation 2 days after the therapy with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
because no data on the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s have long half @-@ value pairs such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ f@@ ec@@ ox@@ ib , have to be avoided the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ -
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual variation of the body status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between or@@ alen anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ ic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality Rati@@ o ) if the decision has been made to treat the patient with or@@ alen anti @-@ anti@@ gens .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - or an@@ ral metabol@@ ites are anticipated during an application in pregnancy severe occupation .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if strictly necessary and after careful re@@ considering of use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an irre@@ versible damage of the reproductive @-@ ability caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment of treatment , consultations with respect to the sperm lo@@ be .

primary analysis of this study was conducted in the populations of all patients carried out in the treatment arm the test drug ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistical significant increase in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om has been shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ some Cis@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in @-@ arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment parameters are characterized by an improvement of the lung parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ plat@@ in @-@ arm and a dimin@@ ish of the lung function in the course of time in the control unit .
a multi@@ cent@@ red , random@@ ized , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy followed patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Pop@@ ulation n = 2@@ 83 ) and 7,@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .

for a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted to the Bank of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a licence for the transport of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : for the prevention of acu@@ ity nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy due to cancer affection and the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting chemotherapy due to cancer treatment .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is indu@@ ces by a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding any given of chemotherapy given by the cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ lage , patients should be monitored with am@@ nest@@ y ob@@ struc@@ tions or signs of a sub@@ mar@@ ry I@@ le@@ us after the injection @-@ machine .
however , with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ ag@@ ists , however , caution is provided with equal representation of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients , where the Q@@ t@@ - interval is extended or may tend to be an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should neither be used nor used in the days after chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
in clinical trials hem@@ med Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron &apos;s against tum@@ ors examined chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics not ( cis@@ plat@@ in , cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady professional concentration of oral Met@@ o@@ cl@@ op@@ r@@ ami@@ ds , an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ological analysis was shown that the simultaneous display of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ one , C@@ elec@@ ox@@ ib , Hal@@ op@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ oxet@@ ine , Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ do@@ l , Peri@@ oxet@@ ine , Chin@@ id@@ ine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had not had a significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron at human pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be used , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied at pregnant , unless it is deemed necessary by the treat doctor .
in clinical trials , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observ@@ ant side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions to the appointments ( burning , curing , complaints and p@@ ains ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequency of unwanted events like in the other doses of control ; there were no dose to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been conducted due to the large distribution process , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies were received a total em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) which was given in day 1 without any contrac@@ ted current intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with Mus@@ cle 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who were given the 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given the day 1 intraven@@ ous .
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy is summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the investigations of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation involved and the duration of the stock@@ potential .
the study carried out at 221 healthy subjects or was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of I.@@ v. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single d@@ osen of 0.25 , 0,75 and 2,25 mg .
ré@@ g@@ ation After intraven@@ ous form of Plas@@ mat@@ ec@@ onds follows a slow @-@ reduction of the body with an average termin@@ ous half @-@ time period of about 40 hours .
the average maximum t@@ pl@@ ain@@ t@@ de@@ centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the entire Dos@@ age range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average number of 11 test@@ ran@@ kar@@ cin@@ om@@ pati@@ enten was between day 1 and day 5 measured middle ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ pl@@ ot@@ on@@ de@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ological sim@@ ulations emerged from pharmac@@ ological mis@@ understand@@ ings of 0,25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the following un@@ recur@@ ring intraven@@ ous value ; however , the C@@ max was compared to the default of 0,75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abolic diseases that have compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ ors .
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ studies for the met@@ abolic process have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ es CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the met@@ abolic disease of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ change@@ able substance , made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous Bol@@ in@@ ject for healthy , the overall functioning 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe life @-@ functioning the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ alb@@ wer@@ eit and the average system@@ ic exposure increases with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction in the dose is thereby non @-@ justified .
in pre@@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which may be deemed sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic period , which indicates a low relevance to clinical use .
10 indic@@ ating clinical studies are evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ enk@@ an@@ os that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular DE@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the stock@@ ings of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose ent@@ ru@@ sted in about five times of therap@@ eutical exposure to men ) which have been given daily for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumor , end@@ ocr@@ ine gland , pan@@ cre@@ as , adren@@ al gland , pan@@ cre@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and Hau@@ b@@ um@@ en@@ sers with rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since alo@@ xi , in the case of humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is minimal for humans .

June 2006 passed the Committee for Human@@ arz@@ t@@ ables ( CH@@ MP ) a negative vou@@ chers , in which the approval for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C was recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that al@@ eon of a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same pharmac@@ eu@@ tically effective component should have been approved already in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Refer@@ arz@@ t@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) h@@ epatitis C ( a virus infection caused by a virus infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver cir@@ rh@@ osis indicates that the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood decre@@ ases .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stim@@ ulated it to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ as@@ eon put data on the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and pur@@ ity of the drug , effectiveness and effectiveness of h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with HC@@ V , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference extent of 455 patients .
the study has been measured how many patients after 12 in total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment applied to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ tp : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int db@@ tp : what were the biggest concerns that contributed the CH@@ MP to the recommendation to fail the permit for the procedure ?
furthermore , concerns have been expressed concerns that data on the stability of the drug and of the drug must not be sufficient .
the number of patients with h@@ epatitis C which address the treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Alph@@ eon tested the disease in more patients than with the reference media , moreover , Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
aside from that , in the study there was a immune response to the investigation of the question , to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ body - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be applied to the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with cr@@ itic infection ) and small infected pul@@ ls ( R@@ iss@@ - or snor@@ er @-@ unden ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections caused by det@@ ectable or pres@@ um@@ ably by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant an@@ aphy@@ l@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go might not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but patients under the age of 18 may not be able to reduce skin surface more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the patient after two to three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om ( the parts of the bacteria in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ k@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was bot@@ t@@ led by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke on treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ b@@ lows , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ alex@@ in similar contact : if the results of both studies were combined with Hau@@ b@@ lows , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of sz@@ sz@@ ló ( the ultra @-@ shaped cav@@ ities in the physique ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA , which is not effective enough .
the com@@ mon@@ est side @-@ effect with al@@ mon@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the order .
the committee for human therapeutic t@@ ends ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ened to the conclusion that the benefits of al@@ mon@@ go in short @-@ term skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , sub@@ ver@@ ified small in@@ fir@@ s , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wo@@ unds .
may 2007 the European Commission granted to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go into the whole of the European Union .
the patients , which shows no improvement within two to three days , should still be examined and an alternative therapy is being considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sen@@ sit@@ isation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is broken , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA as path@@ ogen@@ s is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary open wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resist@@ ent stat@@ met@@ aphy@@ l@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were unnecessary .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after 2 @-@ day treatment is no improvement or a deteri@@ oration of the infected job .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low pl@@ ain@@ ting concentration , which were achieved in humans for top@@ ical application due to the me@@ at@@ ched skin or infected cur@@ ves , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 In simultaneous oral gift from 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg Ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ol raised the medium ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be in be@@ et@@ ched skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not necessary to be required when top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reprodu@@ ci@@ pun@@ y icity for oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are inadequate in relation to having a statement on the birth and the federal states / post@@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used only during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of a system@@ ic anti @-@ biot@@ ic@@ um .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding will continue / stop or should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , is between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the cleans@@ ing and benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the alt@@ ar@@ go have applied , the most commonly reported side effect in the administration of confusion , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
h@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthe@@ tic deriv@@ atives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through fer@@ mentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the drug mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective Hem@@ at@@ isation of bacterial proteins through interaction at a certain bond of the 50 sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which diff@@ ers from the Bind@@ ing of other ri@@ ver@@ so @-@ bacterial infections .
data suggests that the T@@ Bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ binding station and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase .
li@@ aison with this bond @-@ station in@@ hibit P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P @-@ bond interactions and preventing the normal education of active non @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ valence of Resi@@ st@@ enz , the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infection forms , should be re@@ bound by experts .
no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is found , irrespective of whether the insul@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of failure to the treatment at S.@@ aur@@ ens should be considered the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
acceler@@ ation in a study involving healthy adult was 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be every day under Oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and be@@ v@@ elled skin for up to 7 days .
5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary patients , individual pl@@ asma apro@@ xim@@ ately won .
the trial took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic recording of people after top@@ ical application of 1 % Sal@@ be is pe@@ dic@@ ated skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP Hem@@ p .

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against h@@ epatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children between 1 and 15 years , which are not imm@@ un against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a two doses of existing vaccines , whereby protection against h@@ epatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dosage .
for this reason Ambi@@ rix not only used when the immun@@ ization is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination can be brought to an end of two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is against h@@ epatitis A or B is , Ambi@@ rix or another h@@ epatitis C or B vaccine will be given .
vaccines have the effect of bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can w@@ ager against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ TRI@@ X adults and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ TRI@@ X children .
the three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases , however , Twin@@ TRI@@ X adults and Twin@@ rix children can administ@@ ered to a vaccine plan from three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix includes identical ingredients , some of the data containing the application of Twin@@ TRI@@ X adults also uses as a test@@ ament to the use of ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of the development of antibodies against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambi@@ rix was at a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , app@@ et@@ it@@ man@@ gel , pain at the injection , red@@ ness , mat@@ in@@ ness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambi@@ rix must not be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission granted to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire
the standardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is to be administ@@ ered at the appointment of the election and the second dose is administ@@ ered between six to twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is needed for h@@ epatitis A as well as for h@@ epatitis B , can vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ os@@ al@@ ous vaccines or with a combination of combination .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis C @-@ HC@@ V ( anti @-@ h@@ epatitis C ) and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A anti@@ virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ bacterial values are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ous vaccines .
it is not yet fully backed by whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed to a h@@ epatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , as they are also in no longer prob@@ able antibodies as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As in all inj@@ ectors , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , appropriate options of medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately .
if a quick protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination of combin@@ able , the 360 ELISA @-@ units @-@ shaped h@@ epatitis A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able h@@ epatitis B surface treatment .
with hem@@ op@@ aly@@ sis and individuals with disorders of the immune system , after under@@ aging , no sufficient anti @-@ HA@@ V@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs are thus achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required .
since there is an intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ e@@ al muscle to a sub@@ optimal cre@@ ature , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie or ble@@ eding dis@@ rup@@ tions there can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections , since it can come to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular pass@@ abl@@ ation in these cases .
if Ambi@@ rix enters into the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ er Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ active Poli@@ om@@ yel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( D@@ T@@ Pa @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - M@@ umps vaccine administ@@ ered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens adequate ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients under immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective must be assumed that maybe no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study that was performed with 3 vacc@@ ination of this wording in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , head@@ aches , head@@ aches and fe@@ ver is comparable to the frequency that has been observed in former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vacc@@ ination .
clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inated ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ers at the age of 1 till 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants in the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix which compared the 3 @-@ cans of combin@@ ant @-@ combinations .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and suffering on a comp@@ ut@@ ational base for a vaccine ambi@@ rix , but not on a comp@@ ut@@ ational basis for each person .
pain was observed after the gift of ambi@@ rix with 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the test of a dose of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
after the complete vacc@@ ination reported 6@@ 6.4 % of the pro@@ b@@ ans that Ambi@@ rix administ@@ ered over pain , compared with 6@@ 3.7 % in the sam@@ pling , which have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age combination .
the frequency of mat@@ ism was however compar@@ ably high ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ inations at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects , the ambi@@ rix received , compared with 36.@@ 2 % at the subjects covered by the 3 @-@ cans combination ) .
the pre@@ valence of pre@@ valence and mat@@ ism was small and comparable to the fil@@ ing of the combined with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine was observed with the 3 @-@ doses of the vaccine .

for the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ o@@ unity was in@@ valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ atable rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age vaccine was significantly higher than with ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical trial study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after ending the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ers either received a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with 360 ELISA units with 360 ELISA units , with a combination of h@@ epatitis A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant HC@@ B surface .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ al food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing , poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark face , a blu@@ ish face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( b@@ ills ) and other symptoms that could possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not fully protect against an infection with h@@ epatitis C or Hepatitis B virus even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 cans .
if you are infected with h@@ epatitis C or Hepatitis B virus that are infected with h@@ epatitis C or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child can still not feel uncomfortable or sick ) may not prevent a vaccine from illness .
an protection against other infections which cause the liver or cause symptoms which are similar to those after a h@@ epatitis C or Hepatitis B infection , can not be con@@ veys .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by the face of skin or the tongue . • if with you / your child has already appeared an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B . • if you / your child has a serious infection with fe@@ ver .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
in a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will tell you / your child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined HC@@ R vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA @-@ units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A @-@ Virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content is usually administ@@ ered for one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the vacc@@ ination protection .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix often suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots suffering , under the skin and not in the muscle decreased . • if you are weak@@ ened in your child due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own physical resistance or when you / your child pers@@ eded to a tick @-@ cat@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix cannot be given in these cases but the immune response of those individuals on the vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Are you taking your doctor if you are taking a further drug / your child ( including those who have been able to get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have received or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case , immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extrem@@ ities .
if Ambi@@ rix is planned at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins can be administ@@ ered , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women are not administ@@ ered except there is urgent that they can be vacc@@ inated against h@@ epatitis A as well as h@@ epatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known for issu@@ ing the first approval for mach@@ ining , it represented the CH@@ MP opinion that the utility @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only limited in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to small patient information .
Ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with in@@ full enzy@@ me def@@ ect or hyper@@ trop@@ ic met@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y ( brain ) with high ammon@@ ium concentration .
Ammon@@ aps is used - split into several items among the meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food mixed or over a gast@@ ric stom@@ er ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach leading tube ) or a n@@ as@@ al onde ( through the nose in the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , that fossi@@ ls could not be compared to another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a p@@ light drug , that is , without any real substance ) .
Ammon@@ ite may also be loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ aches , irrit@@ ability , liqui@@ dity , hydr@@ o @-@ pain , ab@@ oration , skin rash , un@@ pleas@@ ing , un@@ pleas@@ ing , un@@ pleas@@ ing , un@@ pleas@@ ing body or weight gain .
the fund for human therapeutic enh@@ ances ( CH@@ MP ) att@@ ends to the conclusion that Ammon@@ aps in patients may be effective in patients with disorders in the ur@@ inary cycle on high ammon@@ i@@ fications .
Ammon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary conditions , &quot; as due to the rar@@ ity of the condition for the time of approval only limited information about this medicine .
the use is indi@@ ces with all patients , in which a complete met@@ abolic disease has already manifest@@ ed in the real@@ ign@@ ed age ( within the first 28 life @-@ age ) .
in the case of patients with a bel@@ ated form ( in@@ complete Enz@@ ym@@ one that man@@ if@@ ests itself after the first chapter of life ) there is then a indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ trop@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with si@@ eves is AM@@ MONA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of protein toler@@ ances and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake .
after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg , 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in growing and adults .
with patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ or synthe@@ tic py@@ bam@@ yl@@ are , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ synthe@@ tic deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.6 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ OIS PS tablets should not administ@@ ered patients with si@@ eves , as a risk is used for the emergence of an e@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ ul@@ a if the tablets do not get into the stomach .
every tablet AM@@ OIS PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ AN@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or serious kidney failure as well as with so@@ dium and oil education .
since met@@ abolic ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate is done via the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aner gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and become an increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a down@@ heart@@ ed irrit@@ ation of de@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in humans in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during down@@ time contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical ass@@ essm@@ ents with AM@@ MONA@@ PS occurred at 56 % of patients at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events have been understood that they didn &apos;t connect with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( validity 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( representing 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able tox@@ icity reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who has developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ di , Pan@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ erer N@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
a case of over@@ dose stood by 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) with an vers@@ ed dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed at a intraven@@ ation from doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ b@@ ating neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic compound , which is con@@ stru@@ ed by Ac@@ et@@ y@@ ance with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is sign@@ posted over the kid@@ neys .
Stö@@ ck@@ omet@@ ric seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore used as Alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ ter cycle can be assumed that for each gram , so@@ dium yl@@ yr@@ at between 0,12 and 0.15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen are produced .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival progn@@ osis and the clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the earliest manifest@@ ing of the disease with occurrence of first symptoms in re @-@ en@@ unci@@ ation was almost always infectious , and the disease took itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its stu@@ ffy an@@ alogue section within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ ath@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation , altern@@ ate path@@ ogen@@ s , so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ ate and so@@ dium acid amino acids , it was possible to raise the survival rate of new @-@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first phase of life ) diagnosed in 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and that were already treated before the first appearance of severe inflamm@@ al enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y , but even with these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including feminine patients with the h@@ et@@ ero@@ zy@@ g@@ oten form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase inhibit@@ or ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ trop@@ ic enzy@@ me and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , was the survival rate of 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also in case of treatment hardly re@@ versible and in some patients may occur a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical approaches .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ox@@ ides , which is const@@ ituted in liver and Ni@@ ere enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disease in pl@@ asma and urine were reduced by 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ase and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after extru@@ sion and repet@@ itive gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abolic disease was also investigated in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous sub@@ property ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a random single dose of 5 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablets form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable pl@@ ain@@ able pl@@ ain@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ orrho@@ ids , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning to nä@@ sham@@ al fast@@ ing no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at pl@@ asma .
at three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were handled with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single d@@ p@@ ants ) , the average phen@@ yl acet@@ ate in the pl@@ asma surface at the third day 5 times higher than after the first gifts .
the drug is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the current product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine the kid@@ neys removed .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests had so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either as oral ( inf@@ ants and children who have not yet swal@@ low tablets , or patients with ab@@ rup@@ tions ) or have given a th@@ eli@@ al stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a n@@ as@@ al onde .
after previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ born , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ prot@@ a in pl@@ asma should be held within the normal area .
with patients who suffer from an early lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ or synthe@@ tic py@@ bam@@ yl@@ are , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required .
AM@@ OIS PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.6 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
if c@@ atten@@ bl@@ ush were exposed to the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ lit by Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of brain cell .
a prob@@ able tox@@ icity reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old an@@ ore@@ tic patient who has developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opath@@ y in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ azi@@ di , Pan@@ zy@@ to@@ pen@@ ie , periph@@ erer N@@ europ@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ at@@ itis .
Stö@@ ck@@ omet@@ ric seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore used as alternative carrier for exp@@ ul@@ sion of over@@ flow
based on studies on the elimination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ ter cycle can be assumed that for each gram , so@@ dium yl@@ lab@@ yr@@ at between 0,12 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly re@@ versible in the treatment , and in some patients may occur a further deteri@@ oration of neurolog@@ ical approaches .
after a random single dose of 5 g N@@ atri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable pl@@ ain@@ de@@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
at this procedure , the small gau@@ ge made up 0.95 g , the middle measure of 2.@@ 9 g and the large gau@@ ge 8,@@ 6 g so@@ dium poly@@ but@@ yl@@ lab@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to get the drug via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dis@@ solved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of so@@ dium acid amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases are missing specific h@@ enz@@ ym@@ es , so that they accum@@ ulate the out@@ fit waste products that accum@@ ulate in protein in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are done in laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS as so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
while taking AM@@ OIS PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the lact@@ ation you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS not taking because the drug could go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases were also confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , descendants of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory @-@ disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or with the help of your hospital for the purpose of appropriate treatment .

is An@@ gi@@ onal used to prevent cl@@ ots in patients applied to a PCI sub@@ tract , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to keeping the blood flow towards the heart of patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of an PCI .
approxim@@ ating 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , where the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cer@@ vi@@ an @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , a different drug for preventing blood cl@@ auses ) with the common set @-@ down treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient has frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which is used in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) and they received additional medicines to prevent cl@@ ots of blood cl@@ auses , such as ab@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ onal - with or without gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( death cases , coron@@ ary or Rev@@ as@@ oc@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days and a year as effective as usual treatment .
in patients who sub@@ mits himself to a PCI paper , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except with severe ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
An@@ gi@@ onal may not be used in patients who may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or any other ingredients .
it must not be applied in patients who had recently had a ble@@ eding , as well as with people with heavy blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the fund for human therapeutic t@@ ends ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is involved in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI an ann@@ eh@@ er replacement for Hep@@ arin .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd and granted approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ in@@ inf@@ os ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ ation dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous warranty of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
in case where patients in another result is conducted a PCI bus , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion for the duration of the intervention to 1.75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI can re@@ produce the reduced influ@@ x dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the surgery , an bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg can be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the Rhin@@ oplast@@ y .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ onal in patients with a PCI com@@ et of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one in directly subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bolt securing of An@@ gi@@ onal has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT is 5 minutes ) on under 225 seconds should be short@@ ened , a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values should be the re@@ const@@ ituted and dil@@ uted medicinal products to the application carefully and administ@@ ered the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis rapidly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion is properly administ@@ ered .
in patient with moderate kidney @-@ functions ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which covers an PCI sub@@ sist@@ ence ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a reduced influ@@ x rate of 1.4 mg / kg should be used .
if the ACT value below 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.3 mg / kg and the ACT lead to again 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
in patients with moderate kidney failure , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ P@@ LACE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes from the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 The patients with severe kidney disease ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see below section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be managed 30 minutes after an end to the intraven@@ ous limb@@ arin or 8 hours after ter@@ mination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous am@@ abe of the molecular Hep@@ arin .
• known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active or any other components or against deer lack of blood cells or increased blood @-@ risk mit@@ igation effect . • heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ st@@ iti@@ ful bacterial End@@ ok@@ ard@@ itis . • severe kidney disease ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding , especially if Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administ@@ ered in combination with an other anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding experience may occur in patients who may under@@ go a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ arm@@ ies ( PCI ) during the treatment principle everywhere .
in patients who are kept War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should be considered a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) to ensure that the value for treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will again be reached before the treatment &apos;s existing level .
starting from the knowledge of the novel mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ zi@@ en ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ag@@ greg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these agents increase the blood of blood .
in the combination of bi@@ od@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ atic cav@@ ities or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory drugs , the clinical and biological membrane parameters are regularly scrut@@ in@@ ized in any case .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes , which need a treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the pan@@ ache , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm , or as a permanent inf@@ usion with a ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to the regulation of the gl@@ uc@@ ose mo@@ ose ( sugar ) in the blood or that the ins@@ ulin is not implemented effectively .
ins@@ ulin delivery diff@@ ers very slightly from Human@@ ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it affects more quickly and has a shorter period of life than a short @-@ acting human@@ ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in use in combination with a slow ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , where the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the amend@@ ment to the concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ ated hem@@ mo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates , how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study involving type @-@ 1 diabetes , after 6 months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( 7.2 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for ins@@ ulin expi@@ res .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was reduced % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % at human subjects .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients , which may be hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin or any other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be customized if there is a number of other drugs administ@@ ered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood glu@@ ing brick .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Avent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole of the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ inal , thereof or the Del@@ t@@ am@@ us@@ cle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion in the area of pan@@ cre@@ ature .
because of the decreased glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the decreased ins@@ ulin , the is@@ lan@@ ders may be down in patients with a limitation of the liver function .
any change of force , the brand ( her@@ - actors ) , the ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the standard method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin .
3 An insufficient dosage or the breaking @-@ up of a treatment , in particular in patients with a ins@@ ulin gene type , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic Ket@@ o@@ azi@@ di ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin or a ins@@ ulin should be done under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the timing of a hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the functioning of the ins@@ ulin and can therefore change at the conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
zu den substances , which can increase the blood sugar @-@ sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ akers , ob@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , flu@@ oxet@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine hy@@ id@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pen@@ tox@@ ic@@ yl@@ lin , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ thal@@ ate antibiotics .
in addition , under the action of sympath@@ ol@@ ol@@ an@@ tics such as beta @-@ lo@@ osen , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of rep@@ in@@ ep@@ no@@ rep@@ in@@ hibit be weak@@ ened or are missing .
experimental studies for re@@ frac@@ tory studies showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin concerning pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .

after a gl@@ ag@@ ite fitting , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the Ur@@ - thing for the heavy hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin is caused by stim@@ ulating the periph@@ eral of the periph@@ eral ( particular by sk@@ elet@@ on muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( ins@@ ulin types of ins@@ ulin delivery occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em Nor@@ mal@@ ins@@ ulin .
