<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Government reports (EPAR) in which studies is assessed as the Committee for Humanarztenders (CHMP), in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information on your disease or its treatment, please read the package management (also part of EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you require further information on the basis of recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Reres thinking and Speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions. • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological disorder in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal Hochstimmung) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate-heavy and severe episodes and to preventative manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to the rapid control of disturbed unrest or behavioural disorders if the orale ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution to invade or the melting-coated tablets in patients may be applied to those the abcks of tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are just like abilify, should be adjusted the dose of abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances, which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripienzol probably works primarily as a "part Agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripipacol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lesser extent than the neurotransmitters works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine plays a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing mental or manic symptoms and will prevent its re-emergence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of abilify the re-emergence of symptoms, has been studied in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting solution was compared to two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar conditions, which compared to a decreased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study abnormfy about twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of abilify and placebo employed to avoid re-occur in 160 patients, where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of abilify injection solution was compared to a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered on stricter unrest, with which by Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the change of the patient's symptoms were investigated according to a standard scala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body has the melting tablets and the solution to invresorated (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injecting solution, patients who were abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg received, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms experienced unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder decreased abilify in four of the five short term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the reoccur Manic episodes in previously presented patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms experienced unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side-effects of abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disorders (unlocking), hybrightness (anxiety), fatigue, nausea (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia, insomnia) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Humanarztans (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe episodes in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes held on treatment with Aripianzol, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injecting solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder, if a orale therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission granted to the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of bipolar disorder and indicated for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes in treatment with Aripipzol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended initial dose for abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at an accounting period of 15 mg / day and daily, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness at dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although single patients could benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended initial dose for abilify amounts 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients under 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiates should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-electro is set off from the combination therapy, the Aripianzzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after a change of anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripipzol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increase in fault risk with Aripianzol compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripifozol should be applied with caution in patients with known Cardiovascular Diseases (myocardio, hypoid disease, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertension (including aczelenched and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical trials, which a year or less digested, there were occasional reports of the treatment with Aripiquzol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in case of a-abilify patients, signs and symptoms of a spetdyskesia occur, should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient could sign signs and symptoms that indicate to a mns or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medicines must be abusify, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripianzol should be used in patients with scramagainst accidents in the Anamnese or at residues, which are used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years of associated with Aripianzol in patients with Psychosis patients were treated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripipzene, an increased sterile, compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however in one of these studies, a study involving fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the starter for unwanted ceremonial events with Aripiquzol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazidi or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related events with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents actually treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, Polyuria, Polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally found in schizophrenic patients and in patients infected with bipolar disorder, the use of antipsychotic medicines, where weight is widely known as side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and may lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripialzol to the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripipachol in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines has been taken in combination with rubbing side effects such as sea-encoding (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonist of Famotid in, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripianzol, however this effect is not relevant as a clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy subjects, a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) took the AUC from Aripianzol to 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosages.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= "poor") metabolic diseases, the joint application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher Plasmateconds of Aripianzol result in comparison to CYP2D6 extensively metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint Gabe of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with abilify should predominate the potential risks to patients "potential.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-Conductors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be done similar rictions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After sampling of the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, the dosage should be raised to the dosage height at the beginning of the companion therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 jointly with abilify can be reckoned with a moderate increase in Aripipeol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses shown by 10-30 mg Aripiquzol per day no significant effect on the metabolic Surgery of the substrate of CYP2D6 (Dextroxymorphan / 3-Methodimorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethacrylate).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripietol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the concerns used in the animal studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits therefore justified the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including power vehicles, to operate, until they are certain that Aripipachol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more often (representing 1 / 100) than on placebo or were considered as possible medical relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects specified below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study evaluated by patients who were treated with Aripipieol, an overall lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and dyskesia, compared to patients who were treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study conducted over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS is 19% in patients under Aripimenzol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>

<seg id="71">Among the side-effects associated with anti-psychotic therapy, the maligne neuroleptal syndrome, Spätdyskintoxicular and increased sterility in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch have been accidental or absichtable overdosiders with Aripianzol alone in adult patients with estimated doses from up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a tick-conditions in the treatment of an overdose with Aripianzol; however, it is unlikely that hemoggles in the treatment is a high plasma cutting.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripipachol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder via the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripifozol found in vitro a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and an excessive affinarity for dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7- to alpha-1ephrine and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripialzol in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers showed the Positons-fixture reduction in bonds of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptors, on the nucleus cautius and on the putstream.</seg>

<seg id="79">Current values from scales, which were defined as secondary studio agents, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression, showed a significant stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks at stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed himself a significant reduction of disinfestrate, which was placed at 34% in the Aripipezol group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanniin-controlled, multinational double-blind study involving schizophrenia, over 26 weeks, the 314 patients had comprised a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. a increase of at least 5,6 kg at an average weight of approx. 6,6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage 3 weeks of patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder showed Aripianzol a superior to placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks using fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder showed Aripianzol compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboarding and actively-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode, Aripienzol showed a superior to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a sustaining effect that was comparable to that of lithium, Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiuszol also proved to be a comparable proportion of patients with the symptomatic removal of the manie on such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychological characteristics, which in part spoke about 2 weeks not on Lithium- or Valproat-monotherapy with Ariadprazol a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial period over 26 weeks, followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks during a stabilisation phase before Randomatization had achieved a remission, in view of the prevention of a bipolar retreat in regard to the prevention of a bipolar retreat in the disease.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on gravitro-studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 is responsible for dehydration and hydroxyness of Aripiquirol, the N-Dealkyregulation is created by CYP3A4 catalysis.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elike bath is nearly 75 hours for Aripialzol with extensively metabolic diseases over CYP2D6 and with approximate 146 hours at 'poor' (= "poor") Metabolizing over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">With Aripianzol there are no differences in the Pharmacoinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacological investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no sex-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A resource-specific evaluation for the Pharmacoinetics revealed a notice to clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking on the pharmacopinetics of Aripialzol.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacological properties of Aripipieol and Dehoho-Aripianzol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A Retriosis study at Probanden with differential radiator cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver cancer and dehydro-Aripipol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which does not suffice to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety technology, toxicity in repetitive gift, reproduction, genotoxicity and for canopogenous potential the preclinical data has no special hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in doses, or exposure, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure for people, so they have limited to the clinical use only limited or no importance.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects caused a dosisdependent adrenalysis (lipofuscin or pigment exposure to female) and an increase of adrenal barriers among female) and an increase of adrenal barricants and combined ear canal treatment (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10times of middle steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended dosage dose of people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the phylation of sulphate-constants from Aripianzol in the Galle from monkeys to repetitive oritivity from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81cm the recommended dosage dose of people based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human Galle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of concentrations of hydroxy- Aripianzol not more than 6% of the concentrations, which were detected in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limits (6%) of the in vitro dissolution.</seg>
<seg id="99">With rabbits these effects were observed in doses, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11f of the middle steady-State AUC in the recommended clinical maxim osis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also "reference media").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels, where associated with a blood transfusion complications may occur if in front of the intervention, an individual bleeding is not possible and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with seseamed must be led under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disease, for which the drug is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In case of patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a professional circulation, Abseamed is to be injected into a Vene.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injections may also be made by the patient or his supervisors if they have received a reasonable manual.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy, the tick-globinary values should always remain in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are ahead of the treatment to ensure that there is no lack of iron, and iron supplementary should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, an anaemia can be caused by a erythropoietinassment or thereby that the body does not sufficiently address the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also applied to operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell, into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which they are designed to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with appointments as injecting in a Vene during a main stud with 479 patients who suffer from kidney problems, compared with the Reference bulb.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a Vene before they were either issued on seamed or continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in hemorrhoids between the beginning of the trial and the period period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also laid out the results of a study where the effects were examined by the skin of preramed Abseamed with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients who received one chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems, the haembodiment of patients who have been adjusted to Abseamed to maintain in the same measure as with those patients who continue to be Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to these patients, the patients continue to receive Eprex / Erypo, an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the curated by 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The commonest side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, the occasionally to symptoms of a encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, steching migraine headaches and turbulence can lead.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients, which may be hypersensitive (allergic) against epoxetin alfa or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injecting under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, since further studies are needed to ensure that this is triggered by no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The committee for human therapeutic tends (CHMP) came to the conclusion that for Abseamed was produced in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of proof that medicine has generated a comparable quality, security and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures the seamed is provide for medical staff in all member states, including information about the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="650">The overall body-Clearance is independent of the dose: 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of zoledronic- concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma centre).</seg>
<seg id="652">A decreased clearing-out of cytochrome-P450-enzyme metabolic substances is unlikely, because coledronic acid is not metabolized and because it is a watchful or not even more direct and / or irreversible, metabolism inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Zolatronic acid correlate with the creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and for the 64 examined patients in the means of 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">It follows that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and an excessive kidney failure to down to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of zoledronic acid.</seg>

<seg id="750">Action is applied to the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as in insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied solely (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which Metformin (a diabetic medication) is not displayed along with another Diabetesmedikament (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients) that can not be customized with metformin alone in the highest accuable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylharnant or insulin, the previous dose of sulphonic treatment can be kept, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here should be reduced the dose of sulphylrescuffs or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be improved and the blood sugar mount that makes type-2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients the patients were examined for medication therapy; in this case patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphonic nitrogen, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either as either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In trials of studies the concentration of substance in the blood (glycosyliated hemmovibin, HbA1c), which indicates, how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to lowering the HbA1c factory, which suggests that the blood sugar values when used in application of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg were reduced.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripley study, the effect of the additional gift of accounts for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonic nitrogen in a reduction of HbA1c values around 0,94%, while the additional gift of placebo has led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of accounts and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who accounts in addition to insulin, reduction of HbA1c values of 20% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who were additionally placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (cold), weight gain and hypoanaesthesia (diminished sensitivity to Reizen).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must neither be applied to patients who may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) compared to Pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor even in patients with liver problems, ingestive heart or diabetic Ketoazioni (high levels of ketacces - infants - blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (in common use) is intended to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin, where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission granted to the Company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited registered a permit for the marketing of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to white, vaulted and carry on one side the markings "15" and on the other side the wording "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also displayed for combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate and in which Metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance. (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering by the presence at least a risk factor (e.g. grown coronary heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain or loop, particularly those with reduced diocal reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be seen on signs and symptoms of a congestive heart failure, weight gain and can be observed if Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular abcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced extraction disease has been conducted.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on congestive Heart, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased export-liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of normality) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazone must not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">When the ALT shows up to 3 times the upper limit of the standardization area increases, the liver enzymers are as soon as possible to control once again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develop symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, roughness, fatigue, appeal and / or darker Harn, are the liver enzymers to check.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of patients with Pioglitazis should continue, should be guided by the clinical examination of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, a dosisdependent weight gain was detected, which can be typed by fat deposits, and in some cases connected with a fluid retion.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemorrhorate joined the therapy with Pioglitazon a minor reduction of average hemmoor relative (relative reduction of 4%) and the hematracid (relative reduction of 4.2%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes have been observed in comparatively controlled studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemmoglobins for 3-4% and islanders (relative reduction of hemmoglobins by 1-2% and the haematographic level by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin sensitivity to patients, the Pioglitazone or triple-combination therapy with a sulphisylharnant or as a branch of interconnective therapy with insulin, is the risk of dosisdependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market introduction, under the treatment with Thiazolidindian, including Pioglitazon, was reported on an occurrence, or a deterioration of a diabetic sonic modem with a diminishing of the visual sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaömen should be aware of the possibility of a Makulaödems if patients report about interference of visual conditions; a suitable ophthalmic assessment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports undesirable events with regard to bone breakthroughs from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients who were treated with Pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculating Fraktur incidence was 1.9 Fraencies per 100 patient-years in the women treated with Pioglitazon treated to women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-years for women who were treated with an equivalent medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular events, compared with Pioglitazon treated patients with pioglitazon treated to patients with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who have been treated with a symcancer treatment.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is abducted (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have relevant effects on the Pharmacoinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, Phenomena and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with pharmaceuticals, which are metabolized by these ymes, e.g. orale contraceptiva, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA concentric Reducers are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 rotractor) result in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to the fact that treatment with Pioglitazon increases in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance, and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very frequently &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the breakdown of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic substance.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT-kes over the trimmer of the standard range also frequently appears on the same as placebo but less common than in comparative groups under Metformin or sulphylharnant.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced unrovascular disease the incidence of a severe fall incongestive heart under Pioglitazon was 1.6 percent higher than placebo when Pioglitazon or...</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market introduction rarely was reported about heralcongestive Heart of Pioglitazon, however, if Pioglitazon was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">It has been conducted a summary analysis of reports undesirable events with regard to bone breakthroughs from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients in the group treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures appeared at 44 / 870 (5.3%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) with patients treated with a symphonation.</seg>
<seg id="797">While taking the maximum daily dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days were not symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to act on an activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-g)), which leads to an increased insulin-sensitivity of lier-, lipos- and skeleton-muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the Glucoseproduction in the liver and increases the peripheral of Glucosiness in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the period until the afterleave of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ¬ 8.0% after the first 6 treatments).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar figure could be defined as HbA1c (8,0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of patients (compared 50% of patients under Gliobazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebokontrol study on 12 months, patients, their blood sugar was placed in spite of three-month optimization hinsulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo randomized.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon reduced the middle HbA1c - value for 0,45%, compared to the patients who continue to be only insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in the group treated with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year showed themselves under Pioglitazon, an statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / creatinin contractor compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg and placebo) was tested in a small, 18 weeks and tested by type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma triglycemeride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as low-level, however clinically did not be significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazis reduced in comparison to placebo, metformin or extremclazide, the total coupling glycemaeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL Cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo there was no statistically significant significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels observed, while under metformin and extremclazide diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazis not only sober-triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial of the triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the triglycemic absorption as well as to the hepatic triglycemic synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients were randomized with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced extraction and cardiovascular treatment either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is rapidly resorated, with top-concentration of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution from M-IV to the effectiveness in about the triplest of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it was not possible that Pioglitazis does not have a relevant effect on the Pharmacoinetics or pharmacodynamics of Digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 P450 2C8-Indutor) or lowers the plasma centre by Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marker pioglitazone in humans, the marker was largely found in the Fäld (55%) and to a lesser extent in Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The middle Plasma-elimination tsalbwertszeit of unaltered pioglitazon is at men 5-6 hours, and that of the total active metabolic disease lies at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma centre of Pioglitazon and its metabolic disorders are lower in patients with limited renal kidney function, although the recast of the oral clearing of the matures were similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies performed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance to repetitive administration, plasma-magnification, anaemia and reversible eccentric hearthypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to the fact that treatment with Pioglitazon is diminished in the gestation of hypertamine and increased insulin resistance, thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the federal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were induced in the rat of hyperplasia (among male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the ureter epithelium induced.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study conducted over 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular events, compared with Pioglitazon treated patients with pioglitazon treated to patients with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who have been treated with a symcancer treatment.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study about two years the effects of a combination-combination therapy of Metformin, each investigates pioglitazone or gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed itself under Pioglitazon catchy a statistical significant decrease of the Albumin / creatinin contractor compared to the output value.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks of reduced pioglitazone not only sober-triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial of the triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the Tryglyzerid absorption as well as to the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="1176">This was compared to 22% (60 of 268) patients suffering from Allopurinol and in any of 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhea, nausea (Nausea), rash and abnormal life values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially for patients with heart damage in prehistory, possibly there is also an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The fund for human therapeutic tools (CHMP) atted to the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in the blood pressure in the blood than Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>

<seg id="1293">3 The risk of heavy ignophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the drug correctly and / or it after the appearance of symptoms that point out to a malignant irritation, further.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing references to the patient are passed and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large clinical trials with alendronat no increased risk was established, many severe (after market introduction) Mag- and Duodenalulcera, including some severe and with complications, reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronat foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium-supplements, antacid and some orale medicines can adversely affect the absorption of alendronat if they are at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait after taking alendronat at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interactions studies have not been carried out, alendronat in clinical studies have been taken jointly with a variety of prescribed medicines, without the clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended ONLY for the application for postmenopausal women and is therefore neither governed by breastfeeding women during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronat do not give any indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal or post-natal development.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressant therapy and treatment of transplant patients should relocate this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tacrolimus this can result in Transplantatranties or to an increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; replacing the formulation or regime, should only be carried out under the tighter control of a medical certificate (see Figure 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug should be carried out and appropriate Dosisizations to ensure that systemic exposure to tacrolimus remains.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Patient with limited renal function because the kidney function has no influence on the Pharmacoinetics of Tacrolimus, it may be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Because of the nephrotoxic potentials of Tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of kidney function (including a regular identification of serumcreatonin levels, calculation of the creatinine clearance and a monitoring of urinary care) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Change from Ciclosporin to Advagraf in the conversion from a Ciclospordum to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Figure 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the feedity in full bluffing The dose should primarily rely on the clinical assessment of repulsion and compatibility with plaid of full bluetting-tacrolim-sliding controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended frequent checks of the tacrolimus on levels during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic checks during the accounting therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled by conversion from Prograf on Advagraf, Dosiscustomisation, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or in simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tacrolimus thoroughanate bleeding (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearing, adjustments for the dose can take several days until the steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases if the aging of blood in the blood 20 ng / ml is not exceed.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of Tacrolimus can usually lie in the first time after liver transplantations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and nish and transplants patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent acquisition of liver, kidney and heart transplants have generally been used to bleak concentration in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe undesirable events, including trants and other side effects that can occur in a result of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposition.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; replacing the formulation or regime, should only be carried out under the tighter control of a medical certificate (see Figpp4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">To prophylaxis of the transplant-breeding at adult heart transplant ideas and transplant in Kindesage are still no clinical data for the saved wording frvagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions between the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a toning of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus can include the intake of herbal supplements (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies during a treatment with advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus- concentrations being offered in the blood because the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases Prograf was referred to as Kardiomyopathy, or septum hypertrophia, which therefore may also occur under advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Additional factors, which increase the risk of such cliniciencies, are an existing heart attack, a treatment with cortician, blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, liquid-load and oil.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to possible risk of malignition with suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen by means of a high protective factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as a inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore increase the blood-values of Tacrolimus or decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus- blood levels with equal representation of substances, which can change the CYP3A metabolism and to set the tacrolimus dose to maintain gender concentrations corresponding to maintenance (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data posted since the initial data, the CHMP has continued to be considered positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP was charged on the basis of the safety profile of ADVENT, which requires a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorization should apply for another renewal applications in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited by the Committee for Humanarztosis (CHMP) officially recognised that the enterprise takes its application for approval for the transport of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the cords (tissues that connects other structures in the body, and it does not base).</seg>
<seg id="1642">These are a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">With the virus in Advantin, it is a "Adenovirus" that has changed so that there cannot produce copies of himself, thus no infection can cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advantin would have been crowned right into the tumors and allow cancerous cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is made from the defective in the human body existing p53 gene, usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to the killing of the cells in when the DNA can't be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-women-meni-cancer, where the p53 gene is defect, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells may continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company put data from a study involving patients before the Li-Fraumeni-cancer in the area of sub-producing, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company on the questions presented, some questions were unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial submitted documents the CHMP created a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not enough that the injection of Advantin Li-Fraumeni-Tumors takes advantage of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Furthermore, the company did not sufficiently proved that Advantin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"" "the company did not acknowledge the CHMP opinion, whether the withdrawal and consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or" "" "compassionest Use" "" "programs with Advexin." ""</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changed drug release" means that the tablets are so merged that one of the effective components is immediately unreleased over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeraze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen (inflammation of the nose-way) in patients with nakeaval swelling (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and teenagers from 12 years old, the recommended dose of aerators is twice daily, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, above all the swelling of the Nasenendometrium (hidden nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of over 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be done on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main function dimensions were the changes in the severity of the haystail symptoms that were reported by the patients before starting treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients took their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how hard the symptoms experienced in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay symptoms, except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the aerinze reported on a decrease of the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35,9% in patients with pseudo-ephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the Nasenschleimkin has been seen, patients under the aeration showed a alleviation of the symptoms by 37,4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aeration (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachykaral (cardiac), anti-irritation, headache, headaches, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somedolenz (sleeity), inscriabruptions and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeration may not be insensitive to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, accephrined ingredients or loratadine (a different drug for treating allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeration may also not be used in patients suffering from a narrow margin (increased eye pressure), cardiac disease (hypertension), hyperthyroid (bridging the thyroid) or have already had a hemorrhorhagic stroke (through a brain blood circulation) or have a risk to the hemosrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the firm Europe Europe to approve approval for the marketing of aerators in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is to swallow (i.e. without them to crack, to break or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to infutilisation and effectiveness, due to the lack of data on unobjectionable and effectiveness (see section 5.1) not used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended that limit duration to 10 days, as with long-term application the activity of Pseudoephedrine can take in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the drop of swelling of the veil in the upper breath, treatment can continue when needed with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrin contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monocontaminoxidative (MAO) or are being treated within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combinable use of pseudoephedrine, Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Dihydrombotamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazolin, naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient-lific value and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations regarding dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of aeration units were not tested in patients with kidney or liver tumor and the data are not enough to address appropriate recommendations regarding dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment at the occurrence of a hypertension or tachykarine or of Palpitations, cardioparism, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a reinforcement of the headache) must be decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups is recommended to care: • Patients under digitalis • patients with cardiac disease • patients with hypertension • patients with a myocardio market in the Anamnese, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck or bronze work in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to impose some 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, as Antihistaminika can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin actions respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the framework of clinical trials with desloratadine, in which Erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, however no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plaintosis of desloratadine have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor tests were no significant differences between patients treated with desloratadine and those treated with placebo-treated patients regardless of whether desloratadine alone or alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme of desloratadine is not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro-studies have shown that the Drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unobjectionable use of the use of aeration during pregnancy is not backed up experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, no increase in frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals can not always be transferred to humans and because of the vasostriktorical properties of pseudoephedrine should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be discussed, however, that in very rare cases it may be to be granted, which may lead to a impairment of transportation or ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a ZNS-depression (sea-encoding, decreases, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular diseases) and a Zjoint stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettuals.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, complicated micro, muscle weakness, arousal, breathing ingestive, cardiac, levelling, nausea, discarvings, nausea, tiness, respiration, tendardisruptions and hypertension or mortotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as are atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, Pupillenstarre and - dilatation, Hautrötung, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of progeorous cytokens as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mesh / Basophile, as well as the inhibition of the expression of the eagle's P leverine on endothelix.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg does not affect standard measurement sizes including the strengthening subjective perseverity or the tasks which are associated with the flies.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, recommended dosage of 5 mg daily, no increased frequency of sleeity when compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can create additional likeable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, an speedometer, or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients received in the age of 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with the 414 patients Amize tablets were received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aeronze tablets, determined by the total sugar for the symptom (except Naseneaval swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment times.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aeration tablets in terms of the vibrating effect, determined by means of the nose-skin swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratine over the 2-week treatment times.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aertorze tablets showed with regard to gender, age or ethnial belonging to patient groups are not significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacopinetics of aerodate, desloratadin is reversible within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the perorous application of Aeraze at healthy volunteers over 14 days, the fluidity of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine is reached in day 10.</seg>

<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety technology, for toxicity in repetitive gift, for genotoxicity and restructive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine does not allow specific dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its constituents, and the observational effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive-stoxikological studies the combination of loratadine / pseudoephedrine used in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied to the protection against flu, which is caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza type virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that could cause a future pandemic in front of a trunk of the flu and a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Grippepandemie breaks out when a new trunk of gripping-virus spreads, that can easily spread from man to man because people have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine the immune system sees the immune system contained in the vaccine contained the parts of the gripping-virus as "physical-strands" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later in a position to form a contact with a gripping-virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membranes of the virus with the "surface environment" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a body-strangled), certified and used as a part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">The scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine does not consist of meeting the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA to pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor's doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, which are infected with humanly immunoweeds in AIDS (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who can't swallow the capsules, can be taken as a solution to boarding, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenase should only be enacted if the doctor has tested which anti-viral medicines has been taken before, and the likelihood of the virus will address to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is determined according to the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Aging increases in combination with other antiviral medicines that are HIV-quantity in the blood and keeps them on a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not to cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also delay the development of with AIDS infection and disease.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV infected adults, which previously had not been treated with defects.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This was compared with low dosisted Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenase was compared with 206 adults which previously had to be assessed earlier, with other types of evidence.</seg>
<seg id="1913">Main-indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients suffering from adverse concentrations of HIV in the blood (virus last) or the change in virus management after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In trials of patients who had previously had taken no prototype of earlier, although, after 48 weeks, more patients had a virus load of 400 copies / ml than placebo but Agenase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children changed Agenerase also the viral load, whereby apart from the children who had previously been treated with the release numbers, were only very few of the treatment mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults, which previously was treated with the release numbers, that had been treated with Ritonavir enhanced drug Agenerase the virus-last after 16-weeks treatment just as effective as other prototype:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteins, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the virus after four weeks than in patients who were previously carried out their previous prototype:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenase (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea (diarrhoea), nausea (nausea), nausea (nausea), vomiting, rash and fatigue (tiredness).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 aexase should not be used in patients, which may be hypersensitive (allergic) against lethercar or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerated can also not be used in patients, the currant (herbal supplements for treating depression) or drugs, which are as well as anti-generase and are taken into high concentrations in the blood of health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV there is to be carried out, the risk of a podystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteoekrose (cancers of bone tissue) or an immune response syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The healthcare industry (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenase is usually taken together with the pharmacogenetic deepening of Ritonavir but the committee establishes that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously did not have been proven to be a prototype.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "", "as for the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000 divided the European Commission to the Glaxo Group Limited to approve a permit for the transport of Agenerase in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenase is in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1- infected, prototype (PI) for previously untreated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usual, Agenerase capsules are to be administered together with low doses from Ritonavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for entry is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, are non-generated capsules and solution for disposable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for aging capsules is 600 mg siropavir twice daily along with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules without the amplifier additive) used by Ritonavir (Boosterung) must be applied greater doses of agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for aging capsules is 20 mg payload / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg payavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacoinetics, effectiveness and safety of aging in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteins mentioned children have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerated is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for inconsistency and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacogenetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe life-dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate-functioning with caution, in case of patients with severe living-functioning it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Aging may not be given simultaneously with pharmaceuticals, which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoymms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal supplements, the currant (Hypericum perforatum) contain, may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma fluctuations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir during the intake of Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy leads to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others due to sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usual, aging capsules are to be applied along with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have a increased risk for heavy liver navigation, potentially fatal.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of a simultaneous arviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the underlying information of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hazard function including an chronically-active hepatitis also show increased frequency of liver dysfunctions under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucosteroid drugs which are exchanged via CYP3A4, is not recommended, unless the possible benefits of a treatment the risk of systemic cortical effects including Morbus Cushung and Supplies of the adrenalytic function. (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reduction of inhibitor Lovastatin and simvastatin strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of aging with Lovastatin and simvastatin due to the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs, may cause serious or life-threatening adverse side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards ratio), are available methods for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenase may be less effective because of decreased plasma jet-bricks (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir may change the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptiva, however, the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadon is given simultaneously with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium symptoms, especially if it can also administered low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of risk of toxicity, due to the high propylene glycooperating system of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aging should be set in duration 5, if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the veils are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received a chemotherapy treatment including proteins, has been reported on the appearance of diabetes mellitus, Hyperglycaemia or an excuse of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other conditions whose therapy have been necessary to associate with the development of a diabetes mellitus or a hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, like a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated.</seg>
<seg id="1956">At hammophiles patients (type A and B) that have been treated with components, there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous hematoms and hemorrhoids.</seg>
<seg id="1957">With HIV-infected patients with heaviective immune diseases (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which leads to severe clinical concise or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial ether is believed (including use of cortician, alcohol intake, heavy Body Mass-Index), cases of Osteonekrose particularly in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width of biomass may not simultaneously exist with pharmaceuticals, which possess a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoymms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenase with Ritonavir must not be combined with pharmaceuticals, whose active ingredients are mostly connected to CYP2D6 and for the increased plasymptoman associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC by Amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the dehumble plasma seal by a dosage increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, were very often unwanted effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Currant (Hypericum perforatum) The Serumspiegel of Amprenavir may be humiliated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient takes already redemped the speck level and if possible, the payout mirror is and, if possible to check the Viruslast and suspessen the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also ebavirency below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax, against 30% low, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Amprenavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily) administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg vials are applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the efficacy and nonsense of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% dedged if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg vionavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of Amprenavir plasma was achieved twice daily) with Kaletra (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg vionavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dose of control for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, but it is recommended a close-machine monitoring, since the effectiveness and nonsense of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmacogenetics study carried out in combination with didanosine, but due to the antacid component of Didanosin recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase is at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination of Efavirency in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with ofavirency in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposition of both of the intervals would be extremely low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin to other proteins and existing limited data would be suspect that Neviral may possibly lowers the serumkonzentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable, since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased or perhaps subtherapeutic plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out, as an accurate forecast of the effect of combining Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous display of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma centre (AUC) by Rifabutin to 193%, and thus to a increase in associated with rifabutine effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to go rifabutin along with Agenase, is going to diminish the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dosage, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacogenetics studies with nuclear assembase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma-loys of both drug could be enhanced in the case of current administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of Ketoconazole per day led to an increase in Cmax of Ketoconazole in Plasma at 25% and the AUC (0-profit) to the 2,69Y once a day without the simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below including substrates, Hemmer or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied together with aging effects, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions that are combined with these drugs once they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other components, it is advisable that antacid can not be taken at the same time as asexase as it can come to resoratory disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsiva that are known as an enzyme nounces (phenytoine, phenobarbital, Carbamazepin), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma-bricks of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium-canes such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, default, Nimodipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can increase 10 by Amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with nuclear assemblies can considerably increase and increase plasma-effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors in combination-effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in the ritonavir 100 mg capsules two times a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days dropped significantly, while the endogenic Kortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -levels interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous generation of Agenase is not recommended along with these glucose veins, unless that the possible benefits of a treatment are the risk of systemic cortical effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA-Reduktase inhibitor such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose richer was heavily dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to expect the plasma jet at equivalent of agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since Plasmaspiegelung of this HMG-CoA-Reduktase inhibitor to Myopathy, including a rhubdomyolyse, the combined application of these drugs with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended a common monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror, as the plasma-concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased when used by Amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, algenerative may not be applied together with administrated Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while on an equal application of Agenase with parcentric Midazolam caution is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous application of paramount co midazolam with other protector inhibitors point to a possible rise of plasma-bars from Midazolam to the 3- up to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon can be administered along with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium symptoms, especially if it can also administered low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the per se small comparability of historical comparisons there can currently be no recommendation such as the prenavir- dosage is to adapt if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous display of Warfarin or other oral anticoagulanzien, together with Agenase, an enhanced control of the INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended for the possibility of mitigation or reinforcement of antistress-otic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir at hormonal contraceptiva is not predicted, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for equal absorption of asgenase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after diligent cancellation of potential use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks to fetus.</seg>

<seg id="2003">The advocacy of Agenase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the adverse effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly up to four, performed early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are used to be applied to HIV virus or another at the same time on HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the derunderdisease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects originate from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) in which with the previously previously previously untreated patients 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily received.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4), which were considered by the investigator as in connection with the research center, and in more than 1% of patients appeared, as well as in treatment performed laboratory changes (degrees 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>

<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not previously untreated persons, treated with Américos in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudan over a mid duration of 36 weeks was only one case (Stiapack) observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 played at 245 NRTI- in comparison to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 patients (11%) in combination with different NRTIs over a mid duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Hautes-rainfall were usually easily pronounced, only a theme public or makulopapillary nature, with or without itchiness and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared within two weeks, without having to demolished the treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoekrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">With HIV-infected patients with heaviective immune defect can be developed at the time of the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) to develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenase twice daily along with low dosipped ritonavir (degrees 3 to 4) and CPR values (degrees 3 to 4) and CPK values, which were reported in patients, the Agenase, along with low dosified Ritonavir were very frequently performed.</seg>

<seg id="2017">The anti-viral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both acute and chronic lymphocyc cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as in peripheral blood-ymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibiting centre (IC50) of Amprenavir is located in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acute-infected cells and is a substantial µM for chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of the HIV-1 replication of humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In treating antiretroviral not previously untreated patients with the currently approved Fosampanavir / Ritonavir-dosages - like other Ritonavir spoosterone treatment schemas with protector inhibitors - the described mutations are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">At sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not previously untreated patients who have received 700mg Fosamprenr twice daily in the study of ESS100732, entered a virology target of up to week 48, with 14 insulates genotypic could be investigated.</seg>

<seg id="2025">On genotypic resistance-based analysis genotypic interpretations systems can be applied to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The present (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11-algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines Resistenz as the presence of nuts L10F / F, L54A / F / G, I54A / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with a stolen phemite with Ritonavir as well as a decreased chance of a virologic response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutationsmusters can be subject to changes through additional data, and it is advised to continually draw the current interpretations systems to analyze the outcome of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">In the phenomenal resistance-based analysis clinically valuable interpretations systems can be applied in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2035">The evidence of the effectiveness of aging in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study ($600 mg twice daily) and Nuclosideraloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with reduced shionavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">A hundred-three-sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-stage A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis set the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI-group with regard to the period of average sales (AAUCMB) in the husload (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, in a non-underestimated shaft of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unvoozed aspirations is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 260 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years, from which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution to include and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There has been no low dosisted Ritonavir simultaneously; the majority of patients treated with PI-treated patients had previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the study included a plasma on HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the output.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basiola on these data should be considered at the treatment optimisation with PI previously untreated children of the expected use of "unbroken" asparagase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">According to oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for resolving the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax by contrast 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% discount of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) influenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of ressorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seeming quantity of distribution is roughly 430 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg) and leaves on a large branch volume, as well as an immense penetration of spprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the substance in plasma, whereby the quantity of unseen Amprenavir which represents the active share, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unseen Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active ingredients during the average interval in the steady state in the steady state across the area of Cmax, ss up to Cmin.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs, CYP3A4 induced or inhibits or a substrate of CYP3A4 will be given with caution when they are given simultaneously with Agenase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily prenavirus position as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is out of the solution 14% less bioachieves than of the capsules; therefore, are exgeneral solution and agenerated capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrams.</seg>

<seg id="2302">The Experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect negative effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Because no data of newborns, who were exponated towards Laronidase on the mother's milk, is recommended, while treatment with Aldurazyme does not satisfy.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical studies were categorised mainly as infusion-related reactions that were reported in 53% of patients in phase 3 (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>

<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of unwanted medications, even if the occurrence of unwanted reactions typically with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme is located in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, the laridase is rapidly removed from the circulation and made of cells in the lysosom, most likely about Mannosis-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as with chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">Aloxi's effectiveness can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antipsychotic medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there are not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance, the bond of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was investigated in three main studies with 1 842 adults who received the Chemotherapies which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">At Chemotherapien, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting were reported 59% of patients who were treated with aloxi in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients with Ondansetron patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">With chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting are 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi, in 24 hours following chemotherapy no revival (153 of 189), compared with 69% of the patients treated with Ondansetron patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">For a comparison with Dolasetron these values at 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005, the European Commission granted to the Bank of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a licence for the transport of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indices: for the prevention of acuity nausea and vomiting at strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer affection and the prevention of nausea and vomiting chemotherapy due to cancer treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting, which is induces by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding any given of chemotherapy given by the corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the collage, patients should be monitored with amnesty obstructions or signs of a submarry Ileus after the injection-machine.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, with other 5HT3 Antagists, however, caution is provided with equal representation of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients, where the Qt- interval is extended or may tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Except in connection with another chemotherapeutics gift, Aloxi should neither be used nor used in the days after chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In clinical trials hemmed Palonosetron's against tumors examined chemotherapeutics not (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacogenic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady professional concentration of oral Metoclopramids, an CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In one of a population-based pharmacological analysis was shown that the simultaneous display of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Dexamethone, Celecoxib, Haloporubicin, Fluoxetine, Haloperidol, Perioxetine, Chinidine, Ranitidine, Sertralin and Terbinafin) had not had a significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the use of Palonosetron at human pregnancies can not be used, therefore Palonosetron should not be applied at pregnant, unless it is deemed necessary by the treat doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observant side effects (a total of 633 patients) which were at least possibly with aloxi in connection, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of oversensitivity and reactions to the appointments (burning, curing, complaints and pains) were stated in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequency of unwanted events like in the other doses of control; there were no dose to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been conducted due to the large distribution process, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies were received a total emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg Palonosetron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7,3 hours) which was given in day 1 without any contracted current intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with Muscle 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 mcg Palonosetron were compared to patients who were given the 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given the day 1 intravenous.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy is summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indications of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) were the effects of Palonosetron to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the investigations of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the involved in the ventricular DE- and Repolarization involved and the duration of the stockpotential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study carried out at 221 healthy subjects or was the assessment of the EKG-effects of I.v. administered Palonosetron in single dosen of 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Régation After intravenous form of Plasmateconds follows a slow-reduction of the body with an average terminous half-time period of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum tplaintdecentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the entire Dosage range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous gift of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average number of 11 testrankarcinompatienten was between day 1 and day 5 measured middle (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-plotondecentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacological simulations emerged from pharmacological misunderstandings of 0,25 mg of Palonosetron to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the following unrecurring intravenous value; however, the Cmax was compared to the default of 0,75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and some more 50% are converted into two primary metabolic diseases that have compared to Palonosetron about less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on 5HT3 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro-studies for the metabolic process have shown that CYP2D6 and, in lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolic disease of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchangeable substance, made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous Bolinject for healthy, the overall functioning 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe life-functioning the terminale Eliminationshalbwereit and the average systemic exposure increases with Palonosetron, a reduction in the dose is thereby non-justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which may be deemed sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic period, which indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 indicating clinical studies are evidence that Palonosetron can block only in very high concentrations of Ionenkanos that are involved in ventricular DE- and reolarization and extend the stockings of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose entrusted in about five times of therapeutical exposure to men) which have been given daily for two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumor, endocrine gland, pancreas, adrenal gland, pancreerenmark) and Haubumensers with rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since aloxi, in the case of humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is minimal for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 passed the Committee for Humanarztables (CHMP) a negative vouchers, in which the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that aleon of a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same pharmaceutically effective component should have been approved already in the EU (also" "" "Referarztans" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (a virus infection caused by a virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver cirrhosis indicates that the values of the liver enzymatic Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood decreases.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which stimulated it to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alphaseon put data on the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness and effectiveness of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with HCV, the effectiveness of Alpheon was compared to the effectiveness of the reference extent of 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study has been measured how many patients after 12 in total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment applied to the drug (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed concerns that data on the stability of the drug and of the drug must not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C which address the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon tested the disease in more patients than with the reference media, moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, in the study there was a immune response to the investigation of the question, to what extent the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibody - special proteins - against the drug), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of Impetigo (one with critic infection) and small infected pulls (Riss- or snorer-unden), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections caused by detectable or presumably by methicillinresistant anaphylcoccus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but patients under the age of 18 may not be able to reduce skin surface more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the patient after two to three days, the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosom (the parts of the bacteria in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">Main indikator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was bottled by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke on treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Haublows, Altargo and Cefalexin similar contact: if the results of both studies were combined with Haublows, spoke about 90% of the patients of both groups to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, was found that Altargo was caused in the treatment of szszló (the ultra-shaped cavities in the physique) or of infections caused by MRSA, which is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The commonest side-effect with almongo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation on the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The committee for human therapeutic tends (CHMP) attened to the conclusion that the benefits of almongo in short-term skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, subverified small infirs, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007 the European Commission granted to the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo into the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The patients, which shows no improvement within two to three days, should still be examined and an alternative therapy is being considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitisation or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamulin Salbe the treatment is broken, the ointment is carefully checked and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA as pathogens is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials at secondary open wounds was the effectiveness of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistent statmetaphylcoccus aureus (MRSA) were unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after 2-day treatment is no improvement or a deterioration of the infected job.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plainting concentration, which were achieved in humans for topical application due to the meatched skin or infected curves, is a clinically relevant imitation in vivo not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 In simultaneous oral gift from 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazol raised the medium retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% Retapamulin salbe in beetched skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not necessary to be required when topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproducipuny icity for oral ingestion and are inadequate in relation to having a statement on the birth and the federal states / postnatale development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should be used only during pregnancy if a topical anti-bacterial therapy is clear and the use of retapamulin is the gift of a systemic anti-bioticum.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding will continue / stop or should be continued with Altargo, is between the benefits of breastfeeding for the cleansing and benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the altargo have applied, the most commonly reported side effect in the administration of confusion, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Hapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The drug mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective Hematisation of bacterial proteins through interaction at a certain bond of the 50 sub-unit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the Binding of other riverso-bacterial infections.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggests that the TBosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomalen P-binding station and the Peptidyltransferase.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Liaison with this bond-station inhibit Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, blocking partial P-bond interactions and preventing the normal education of active non-bosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of Resistenz, the use of retapamulin should appear at least some infection forms, should be rebound by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin is found, irrespective of whether the insulates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to the treatment at S.aurens should be considered the presence of tribes with additional virus factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Acceleration in a study involving healthy adult was 1% Retapamulin salbe every day under Occlusion on intact and bevelled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin salbe twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary patients, individual plasma aproximately won.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The trial took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic recording of people after topical application of 1% Salbe is pedicated skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP Hemp.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolic diseases of retapamulin in human life-microtomes was primarily taught by CYP3A4, in the lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between 1 and 15 years, which are not immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of a two doses of existing vaccines, whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason Ambirix not only used when the immunization is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccination can be brought to an end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is against hepatitis A or B is, Ambirix or another hepatitis C or B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines have the effect of bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it can wager against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens than "foreign" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as since 1996 approved vaccine TwinTRIX adults and since 1997 approved vaccine TwinTRIX children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect the same diseases, however, TwinTRIX adults and Twinrix children can administered to a vaccine plan from three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix includes identical ingredients, some of the data containing the application of TwinTRIX adults also uses as a testament to the use of ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix resulted in between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection of the development of antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of ambirix was at a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, appetitmangel, pain at the injection, redness, matinness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix must not be insensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission granted to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix throughout the entire</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for the Grundimmunisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is to be administered at the appointment of the election and the second dose is administered between six to twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is needed for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, can vaccinated with the appropriate monosalous vaccines or with a combination of combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C-HCV (anti-hepatitis C) and anti-hepatitis B virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A antivirus (anti-HAV) antibacterial values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalous vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully backed by whether immunocompetent individuals who have addressed to a hepatitis A- vaccination, as they are also in no longer probable antibodies as they may be protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As in all injectors, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, appropriate options of medical treatment and supervision may always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination of combinable, the 360 ELISA-units-shaped hepatitis A-Virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B surface treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hemopalysis and individuals with disorders of the immune system, after underaging, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs are thus achieved, so in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since there is an intraoral injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle to a suboptimal creature, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopenie or bleeding disruptions there can be injected subcutaneous injections, since it can come to intramuscular passablation in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix enters into the form of a separate injection, Tetanus-, azelluler Pertussis-, inactive Poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masern- Mumps vaccine administered was the immune response to all antigens adequate (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients under immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective must be assumed that maybe no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study that was performed with 3 vaccination of this wording in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, headaches, headaches and fever is comparable to the frequency that has been observed in former Thiomersal- and preservative vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2751">Clinical trials, 2029 vaccinated ambirix was administered to a total of 1027 vaccers at the age of 1 till 15 years.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and suffering on a computational base for a vaccine ambirix, but not on a computational basis for each person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of ambirix with 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the test of a dose of a dose of 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination reported 66.4% of the probans that Ambirix administered over pain, compared with 63.7% in the sampling, which have been vaccinated with the 3-Dosage combination.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of matism was however comparably high (i.e. over the total vaccinations at 39.6% of the subjects, the ambirix received, compared with 36.2% at the subjects covered by the 3-cans combination).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The prevalence of prevalence and matism was small and comparable to the filing of the combined with the 3-cans vaccine was observed with the 3-doses of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- to 11-year vaccines the appearance of local auditors and general interactions in the AmbirixGroup comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3-cans combination-shaped hepatitis A-Virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">With the 6- until 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a common occurrence of pain (an der injecting stelle) per dose, not per proxy.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that schematic surge of heavy side effects during the 2-cans of vaccination with 360 ELISA- units-shaped hepatitis A-virus and 10 µg recombinant HCV surface, it was not different statistically.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, performed at vacciners at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconformity rates for Anti-HAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month of 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>

<seg id="2764">For the 289 people whose immunounity was invaluable, the seroprotatable rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to the gift of the 3-Dosage vaccine was significantly higher than with ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which were obtained in a clinical trial study at 1- to 11-year-olds a month after ending the full vaccine (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccers either received a 2-cans vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-cans vaccine with 360 ELISA units with 360 ELISA units, with a combination of hepatitis A-Virus and 10µg recombinant HCB surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">With people who were aged at the time of underprized between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies were detected at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoidal immunisation campaign against both antigens were comparable to that which is formed after vaccination of three doses with a combination of combinable hepatomas, A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface in a tin-capacity of 0.5 ml.</seg>

<seg id="2785">In a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will tell you / your child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined HCR vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccination (360 ELISA-units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A-Virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with decreased content is usually administered for one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against the vaccination protection.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it may be that in this case, immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as different extremities.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is planned at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins can be administered, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known for issuing the first approval for machining, it represented the CHMP opinion that the utility-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only limited in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited due to small patient information.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over one month with infull enzyme defect or hypertropic metephalopathy (brain) with high ammonium concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is used - split into several items among the meals - swallowed, under the food mixed or over a gastric stomer (through the abdomen in the stomach leading tube) or a nasal onde (through the nose in the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, that fossils could not be compared to another treatment or with placebo (a plight drug, that is, without any real substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonite may also be loss of loss in blood, depression, irritability, headaches, irritability, liquidity, hydro-pain, aboration, skin rash, unpleasing, unpleasing, unpleasing, unpleasing body or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The fund for human therapeutic enhances (CHMP) attends to the conclusion that Ammonaps in patients may be effective in patients with disorders in the urinary cycle on high ammonifications.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved under "extraordinary conditions," as due to the rarity of the condition for the time of approval only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indices with all patients, in which a complete metabolic disease has already manifested in the realigned age (within the first 28 life-age).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In the case of patients with a belated form (incomplete Enzymone that manifests itself after the first chapter of life) there is then a indication of the use when in the anamnese is a hypertropic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with sieves is AMMONAPS also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of protein tolerances and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg, 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">With patients who suffer from an early lack of carbamylphosphor synthetic pybamylare, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a argininosuccinatsynthetic deficiency must be arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.6 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMOIS PS tablets should not administered patients with sieves, as a risk is used for the emergence of an eophagusulula if the tablets do not get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Every tablet AMOIS PS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g Natriumphenylbutyat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMANPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or serious kidney failure as well as with sodium and oil education.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolic ization and excretion of sodium phenylbutate is done via the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied to patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results concerning pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaner gift of phenylacetate at young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there came to a slowing of neuronal multiplication and become an increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a downhearted irritation of deebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is eliminated in humans in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during downtime contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical assessments with AMMONAPS occurred at 56% of patients at least an undesirable event (AE) and at 78% of these undesirable events have been understood that they didn't connect with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (validity 1 / 10), frequently (representing 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxicity reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretic patient who has developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktatazidi, Panzytopenie, peripherer Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose stood by 10 g (1370 mg / kg) with an versed dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed at a intravenation from doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosisbating neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic compound, which is construed by Acetyance with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is signposted over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöckometric seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore used as Alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the ureter cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium ylyrat between 0,12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival prognosis and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest manifesting of the disease with occurrence of first symptoms in re-enunciation was almost always infectious, and the disease took itself in treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with its stuffy analogue section within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemathalysis, the exploitation, alternate pathogens, sodium benzoate and sodium acid amino acids, it was possible to raise the survival rate of new-born in postpartal (but within the first phase of life) diagnosed in 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and that were already treated before the first appearance of severe inflammal encephalopathy, but even with these patients it was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifested form of the disease (including feminine patients with the heterozygoten form of ornithintranscarbamylase inhibitor), which were treated by a hypertropic enzyme and a proteinreduced diet, was the survival rate of 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are also in case of treatment hardly reversible and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological approaches.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyat to phenylacetate oxides, which is constituted in liver and Niere enzymatic with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic disease in plasma and urine were reduced by 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in soase and with liver cirrhosis after extrusion and repetitive gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolic disease was also investigated in cancer patients according to intravenous subproperty (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a random single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablets form 15 minutes after taking measurable plainable plainations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>

<seg id="2847">At three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were handled with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single dpants), the average phenyl acetate in the plasma surface at the third day 5 times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the current product phenylacetylglutamine the kidneys removed.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus tests had sodium phenylbutyrat with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h after administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either as oral (infants and children who have not yet swallow tablets, or patients with abruptions) or have given a thelial stomieschlauch or a nasal onde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">After previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with newborn, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serumprota in plasma should be held within the normal area.</seg>
<seg id="2853">With patients who suffer from an early lack of carbamylphosphor synthetic pybamylare, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day required.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMOIS PS Granules contains 124 mg (5.6 mmol) sodium per gram sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If cattenblush were exposed to the birth phenylacetate (active Metabolit by Phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramids of brain cell.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxicity reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anoretic patient who has developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktatazidi, Panzytopenie, peripherer Neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöckometric seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore used as alternative carrier for expulsion of overflow</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the elimination of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the ureter cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium yllabyrat between 0,12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible in the treatment, and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological approaches.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a random single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyrat in granulatform were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plaindecentrations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the durability, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">At this procedure, the small gauge made up 0.95 g, the middle measure of 2.9 g and the large gauge 8,6 g sodium polybutyllabyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to get the drug via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water (the solubility of sodium acid amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases are missing specific henzymes, so that they accumulate the outfit waste products that accumulate in protein in the body after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with "acute hemorrhoids" (ACS, decreased blood sugar to the heart), for example at instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myokardinfos (heart attack) without "De- Hebung" (an anomal measured value at the electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Is Angional used to prevent clots in patients applied to a PCI subtract, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to keeping the blood flow towards the heart of patients with Angina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of an PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximating 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS, where the effect of Angiox was compared with a glycervian-IIb / IIIA-inhibitor (GPI, a different drug for preventing blood clauses) with the common set-down treatment with Heparin (another anti-agulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient has frequently used a stent (a short tube, which is used in the arteries to prevent a closure) and they received additional medicines to prevent clots of blood clauses, such as abximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The treatment of ACS was Angional - with or without gift of GPI - in preventing new events (death cases, coronary or Revasoccularization) after 30 days and a year as effective as usual treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who submits himself to a PCI paper, Angiox was just as effective as Heparin, except with severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angional may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudin, other miludine or any other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, young people and children from six years with diabetes, which need a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the panache, the thighs or the upper arm, or as a permanent infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to the regulation of the glucose moose (sugar) in the blood or that the insulin is not implemented effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin delivery differs very slightly from Humaninsulin, and the change means that it affects more quickly and has a shorter period of life than a short-acting humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in use in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type-1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, where the body insulin is not effective, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the amendment to the concentration of substance glycosyliated hemmobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates, how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving type-1 diabetes, after 6 months a reduction of 0.14% (7.2% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% for insulin expires.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was reduced% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% at human subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients, which may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin or any other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from a hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be customized if there is a number of other drugs administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood gluing brick.</seg>
<seg id="2976">September 2004, the European Commission granted to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the transport of Apidra in the whole of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal, thereof or the Deltamuscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of pancreature.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the decreased gluconeogenesis capacity and the decreased insulin, the islanders may be down in patients with a limitation of the liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of force, the brand (her- actors), the insulin (normal, NPH, galvanized, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the standard method can draw a change in the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or the breaking-up of a treatment, in particular in patients with a insulin gene type, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic Ketoazidi; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin or a insulin should be done under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the functioning of the insulin and can therefore change at the conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Zu den substances, which can increase the blood sugar-sugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemakers, obopyramide, fluoxetine, monoamine hyidase (MAO) -Hemmer, Pentoxicyllin, propoxyphs, salizylates and sulphthalate antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the action of sympathololantics such as beta-loosen, Clonidine, Guanethidine and Reserpin the symptoms of repinepnorepinhibit be weakened or are missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies for refractory studies showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humaninsulin concerning pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or the postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether the islanders enters into the human mother's milk, but in general, insulin is taken either in the mother's milk, nor is it resorated to orally.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemics with insomnia can be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injecting of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a doctor or by means of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glagite fitting, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the Ur- thing for the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin is caused by stimulating the peripheral of the peripheral (particular by skeleton muscles and fat) as well as by the imitation of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes showed that in subcutaneous (insulin types of insulin delivery occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with hu- manem Normalinsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with Type-1 diabetes, isus showed insulin delivery range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg a dose of disproportionate glucosiness effect, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosmic effect, just like Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin gene insulin has become almost twice as fast as normal humaninsulin and achieves the whole gluasculling effect of about 2 hours earlier as Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was intentionally designed to be reached in an application of insulin delivery isin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post-randiale glycemic approach is given as humanized Normalinsulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
